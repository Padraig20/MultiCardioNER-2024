BACKGROUND: 77-year-old woman, allergic to metamizole, with a medical history of arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (insulin-dependent), permanent atrial fibrillation and asmabronchial asthma. Under cardiology follow-up for rheumatic mitral valve disease with severe mitral stenosis by surgical commissurotomy in 1991 and subsequent prosthetic valve replacement in 2007 with Carbomedics metal prosthesis no. 27. During follow-up she also developed severe aortic valve stenosis with no symptoms and was being treated with acenocoumarol, bisoprolol, furosemide, spironolactone, olmesartan, insulin and bronchodilators on demand.  CURRENT ILLNESS: The patient attended the emergency department for colicky abdominal pain and fever of 38.2 oC,labelled acute gastroenteritis which resolved with conservative treatment on an ambulatory basis. Five days later, she returned to our centre with a new febrile peak and abdominal pain located in the left iliac fossa that required hospital admission for suspected acute diverticulitis. Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in two blood cultures and antibiotic treatment was prescribed with good subsequent evolution. Twenty days later, he was admitted again due to a new febrile peak with positive blood cultures for the same pathogen; an abdominal CT scan showed diverticulosis with no signs of acute infection, so given his history, it was decided to perform an echocardiogram to rule out infective endocarditis (IE).  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Temperature 38.3 oC. Blood pressure 105/70 mmHg. Heart rate 68 bpm. Conscious, oriented, well perfused. No Osler's nodules or Roth's spots on the skin. Increased jugular venous pulse with venous pulse under the mandibular angle at 90o with prominent "v" waves. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds at 74 bpm with systolic murmur 3/6 in the aortic focus and second sound abolished, radiating to the left sternal border and apex. Pulmonary auscultation: left basal hypoventilation. No oedema in the lower extremities.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS on admission: urea 0.36 g/l, creatinine 0.73 mg/dl; CKD-EPI 79.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, ions and transaminases without significant alterations. NT-proBNP 2,797 pg/ml. ESR 102 mm, Creactive protein 0.81 mg/dl. Haemogram: Hb 10.2 g/dl, Ht 30%, 13,900/mm3 (neutrophils 91.1%). THORAX RADIGRAPHY: radiological cardiomegaly. Mid sternotomy sutures. Pinching of both costophrenic sinuses (greater on the left side). Prominent vascular bundles. Haemocultures (x3): positive for Bacteroides fragilis. Transesophageal echocardiography: severely dilated left atrium. Intact septum: atrial appendage occupied by an image suggestive of a thrombus with little echodense. Double hemidisc mitral prosthesis with good opening (gradients similar to previous studies); several eccentric intraprosthesis regurgitation jets are observed without flow reversal in the pulmonary veins. Two vegetative images implanted in the prosthetic annulus of 12 x 3 mm and 10 x 3 mm mobile, not interfering with the movement of the discs; no periannular abscesses were detected. Left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophied with preserved ejection fraction and no segmental alterations. Thickened, trivalve aortic valve with significantly reduced effective area; no regurgitation. Dilated right chambers; reduced right ventricular contractility (TAPSE 14 mm). Thickened tricuspid valve with good opening and mobility; severe regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL COURSE With the diagnosis of infective endocarditis on prosthetic valve due to Bacteroides fragilis, treatment was started with metronidazole 500 mg/8 hours and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1000 mg/200mg/8 hours intravenous. The patient remained afebrile throughout admission, blood cultures were negative early and she progressed favourably from her slight cardiac decompensation with diuretic treatment. After 6 weeks of targeted intravenous antibiotic treatment, she was haemodynamically stable and in good functional class and was discharged from hospital.  DIAGNOSIS Endocarditis on mitral metallic prosthesis due to anaerobes (Bacteroides fragilis) without associated prosthetic dysfunction. Bacteraemia due to Bacteroides fragilis of possible gastrointestinal origin. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis. |O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Male, 70 years old.  BACKGROUND: - No known allergic drug reactions. - Toxic habits: ex-smoker. - Hypertension. No known diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia. - Aortic valve replacement due to double lesion (Carbomedics mechanical prosthesis no21) on 24 September 1993. Multiple subsequent complications: 9 November 1993: aortic pseudoaneurysm with compression of the right ventricle (RV) and aorto-cutaneous fistula with sternal osteolysis. The fistula was closed at the aortic level and a sternal exeresis and plasty of both pectoral muscles with disinsertion of the humerus muscles (pectoralis major myoplasty) was performed. During this admission he required several reoperations due to bleeding in the context of coagulopathy, both in cardiac surgery and plastic surgery. During his two months in intensive care (ICU) he developed multi-organ failure. 23 February 1995: reoperation for dehiscence of the prosthesis (periprosthetic leak) and implantation of a St. Jude prosthesis no. 21. - Femoral pseudoaneurysm after preoperative coronary angiography. - Duodenal ulcer with gastrointestinal bleeding in 1999. - Spontaneous retroperitoneal haematoma in the context of anticoagulation. - Admission to cardiology in September 2017 for syncope with cardiogenic profile and no clear cause. Electrocardiogram (ECG) in sinus rhythm with left anterior hemiblock of the His bundle (HARIHH), absence of findings in telemetry monitoring and echocardiogram without relevant findings with mild-moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, normal biventricular function and normofunctioning aortic prosthesis. For all these reasons, it was decided to implant a subcutaneous Holter. -Other: repeated acute otitis media in both ears, predominantly in the left ear. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. Usual treatment: acenocoumarol, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 hours, simvastatin 40 mg/24 hours, valsartan 160 mg/24 hours, dutasteride/tamsulosin 0.5/0.4 mg/24 hours.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Admitted on 7/12/2017 to the multipurpose ICU after presenting with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the context of a new syncopal episode with amnesia of the episode, with witnesses referring trauma to the frontal region and objectifying hypotension and bradycardia. On arrival at the ED, the patient was haemodynamically and respiratory stable with blood pressure (BP) 120/70 mmHg, INR 4.65 and sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. A cranial CT scan was performed showing subdural haematoma in the cerebral sickle without midline displacement. The subcutaneous Holter monitor also showed sinus bradycardia during the episode at 50 bpm without pauses, so pacemaker implantation was not recommended. During his stay in the ED, the patient began to have paresis of the right lower limb, so a repeat CT scan was performed, which showed an increase in subdural haematoma and foci of subarachnoid haemorrhage, and it was decided to admit him to the ICU. Initially, the patient presented with right hemiparesis and comical crises that required orotracheal intubation and surgical tracheostomy. Conservative management was decided with good subsequent evolution, and the patient was transferred to neurosurgery, who requested a cardiology consultation due to syncope and a tendency to bradycardia without beta-blocker treatment, and on review of the subcutaneous Holter, multiple episodes of bradycardia and spells of complete atrioventricular block (AVB) were observed. Given the presence of these episodes, the patient was transferred to cardiology for monitoring and to evaluate the implantation of a permanent pacemaker.  PHYSICAL EXPLORATION (on admission to the ICU): Head and face: soft tissue wound in the right frontal region, without active bleeding. No other injuries. Neck: no wounds, haematomas or deformities were identified. Chest: Inspection: no bruises, good respiratory mechanics. No crepitus on palpation. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no pathological sounds. Cardiac auscultation: muffled, rhythmic tones, prosthetic opening click, no murmurs or extratones. Abdomen: inspection: abdomen not distended, not painful. Perineum: no signs of haematoma, no rectorrhagia. Back: no painful stitches or deformities. Extremities: no excoriations. No deformities. No joint instability. Neurological examination: GSC 15 (M6, O4, V5). Pupils isochoric, normoreactive. Motor: right lower limb paralysis. Muscle strength right upper limb 5/5, right upper limb 5/5, left lower limb 5/5, right lower limb 0/5.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS MICROBIOLOGY: blood cultures (08/01/18): in two sets Enterococcus faecalis with antibiogram: ampicillin/amoxicillin S <=1, gentamicin 500 S <=500, strepto 1000 S < =1.000, vancomycin S 1, teicoplanin S <= 1. Subsequent blood cultures negative. ANALYSIS: On admission: normocytic normochromic anaemia with Hb 9.7g/dl, normal platelets, normal leukocytes, with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) 10.39 mg/dl, INR 5.22. Biochemistry with renal profile without alterations, including creatinine 0.45 mg/dl which means a glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) > 90 ml/min, normal liver profile and thyroid profile. On discharge (06/03): CRP 0.73 mg/dl, without leukocytosis or neutrophilia, with Hb 10.2g/dl. Emergency ECG: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. Left axis, narrow QRS, HARIHH (similar to previous ones), without repolarisation alterations. CRANIAL CT (07/12/18): subdural haematoma in cerebral sickle with haematocrit levels. There is no midline displacement. Inflammatory changes in the left middle ear and maxillary sinuses. ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC STUDY (11/1/18): TRANSTORACIC (TTE): left ventricle not dilated, with preserved systolic function. Normal right ventricle. Bidisc mechanical prosthesis in aortic position: movement of both occluders with increased transvalvular gradients (maximum/average 40/19 mmHg) without suspicion of obstruction (triangular jet morphology, acceleration time of 70 ms, AT/ET 0.3, DVI 0.57). Mitral valve: thickened leaflets, mild insufficiency. Tricuspid valve: poor visualisation, no significant insufficiency by colour Doppler. No indirect signs of pulmonary hypertension. Inferior vena cava not dilated with physiological inspiratory collapse (estimated DBP 5 mmHg). Aortic root, ascending aorta and aortic arch not visualised. Atrial septum intact, without suspicion of intracardiac shunt by colour Doppler. Pericardium of normal thickness and refractoriness, without effusion. Conclusions: increased aortic transprosthetic gradients without suspicion of obstruction. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): bidisc mechanical prosthesis in aortic position with movement of both occluders. Intraprosthetic lavage insufficiency is visualised with three trivial regurgitation jets. Rounded image of 4 mm x 3 mm visualised on the aortic side of the prosthesis suggestive of a wart. Thickening of the posterior area of the prosthetic ring, with extension towards mitroaortic fibrosis, thickened anterior mitral leaflet (at the level of A1-A2) and towards the interatrial septum, no fistulous tracts are visualised. Mitral valve with thickening of the anterior leaflet, no images compatible with vegetation. No mitral insufficiency. Rest of valves with no images compatible with vegetation. Conclusions: signs of IE: thickening at the posterior level of the aortic annulus, mitroaortic fibrosis and at the base of the anterior mitral leaflet suggestive of phlegmon. Small endocardial wart, visualised on the aortic side of the aortic prosthesis. Normal functioning aortic prosthesis. Control TEE (23/1/18): signs suggestive of IE with slight progression with respect to the previous study at the level of the aortic annulus, but above all progression at the level of the anterior mitral leaflet with an image of an endocardial wart. Normally functioning aortic prosthesis. Mild mitral insufficiency. CRANIAL MRI (15/01/18): multiple acute cortical microinfarcts of supra- and infratentorial location. Given the multi-territorial involvement, they suggest embolic origin. Decreased size of the left frontal parenchymal parenchymal contusions and subdural haematoma. Abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast (07/02/2018): appearance of focal infarcts in the left kidney, of probable embolic aetiology. TEE (16/02/2018): signs suggestive of IE with abscessation at the level of the aortic ring/fibrous mitroaortic ring, aortic prosthesis with normal gradients, posterior periprosthetic leak related to the abscessed area of moderate degree.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the cardiology department, fever peaks were observed, with Enterococcus faecalis growing in blood cultures. He also had a positive urine culture for Citrobacter freundii (sensitive to fosfomycin and was treated). In view of the blood culture findings, treatment was started with ampicillin and ceftriaxone and an echocardiogram was requested to screen for endocarditis, which showed thickening at the posterior level of the aortic ring, mitroaortic fibrosis and the base of the anterior mitral leaflet suggestive of abscess, while at the same time a small wart was seen on the aortic prosthesis, all of which was compatible with endocarditis. As part of the protocol to search for septic embolisms, a cerebral MRI angiography showed multiple acute cortical micro-infarctions of supra- and infratentorial location (suggesting embolic origin) and a CT scan with no evidence of other peripheral embolisms. Given the presence of advanced local involvement, the case was presented at a medical-surgical session and surgery was ruled out, given the previous surgical history and the high technical complexity. A control echocardiogram was performed after 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy which showed progression with respect to the previous study with the appearance of an aortic perivalvular leak leading to mild aortic insufficiency, disappearance of the aortic wart and the appearance of a wart at mitral level. In this context, it was decided to add tigecycline to the antibiotic treatment due to its better penetration into soft tissues. Subsequently, in the fourth week of antibiotic therapy, he developed sudden pain in the left flank with elevated LDH and CRP, so a new abdominal CT scan was performed which showed the appearance of left renal infarcts. During the sixth week of antibiotic therapy, a new transesophageal echocardiogram was performed showing progression of the valvular lesions with abscessation at the level of the aortic annulus/mitroaortic fibrosis, which had previously been phlegmonous, with disappearance of the mitral wart and progression of the amount of leak, which was moderate. However, the patient was stable, with no evidence of heart failure, syncope or new relevant alterations in the electrocardiogram or telemetry, remaining afebrile with three rounds of sterile control blood cultures (after 1, 2 and 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment), completing a 6-week intravenous antibiotic cycle of ampicillin and ceftriaxone and 4 weeks of tigecycline with good tolerance. From the neurological point of view, she showed clear improvement with rehabilitation, being able to perform gross and fine motor exercises with the affected upper limb and to ambulate with the help of a support. Given the good clinical evolution and the echocardiographic worsening, outpatient antibiotherapy with dalbavancin 1,500 mg intravenous every 15 days was decided, once adequate tolerance had been verified, after administering the first two doses in hospital without complications, fever or positive control blood cultures. With respect to paroxysmal complete AVB, beta-blocker treatment was withdrawn. Given the presence of endocarditis, it was decided not to implant a pacemaker for the time being, maintaining subcutaneous Holter monitoring and outpatient follow-up by both cardiology and the infectious diseases unit, with the patient remaining clinically stable until the present day.  DIAGNOSIS Main diagnosis: IE due to Enterococcus faecalis on mechanical aortic prosthesis with undetermined entry point (bacteraemia), rejected for surgical treatment. Other diagnoses: mitroaortic abscess with secondary mild-moderate aortic insufficiency. Multiple cortical cerebral microinfarcts and left renal infarction secondary to IE. Anaemia in the context of IE.

BACKGROUND: No known drug allergies. No known cardiovascular risk factors. No toxic habits. Non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular dysfunction (LVEF 15-20%) of debut in October 2010 evolving to advanced heart failure (ergospirometry with peak oxygen consumption of 12 ml/min/kg). AF of uncertain chronology diagnosed in 2010. CHA2DS2-VASc 1 point anticoagulated with dabigatran 150 mg every 12 hours. Implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in primary prevention in January 2011, with subsequent inappropriate shocks due to episodes of AF with rapid ventricular response. Usual treatment: dabigatran 150 mg every 12 hours, bisoprolol 2.5 mg every 12 hours, spironolactone 25 mg every 24 hours, furosemide 40 mg every 12 hours, digoxin 0.25 mg half tablet every 24 hours, sildenafil 20 mg every 12 hours, periodic cycles of levosimendan and ferric carboxymaltose.  CURRENT DISEASE: After completing the pre-transplant work-up (see complementary tests), the patient is electively listed for heart transplantation in March 2017, being then in New Yor Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III. One month later, on 18 April 2017, he was telephoned for scheduled admission due to the appearance of an optimal donor for heart transplantation. He was admitted to the cardiology ward and on arrival an electrocardiogram (ECG), complete blood tests with coagulation study, chest X-ray and blood product reserve was requested. The patient was anticoagulated with dabigatran 150 mg every 12 hours, having taken the last dose on the morning of admission (< 8 hours).  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Good general condition. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Afebrile on admission. Haemodynamically stable with blood pressure (BP) 107/65 mmHg and heart rate (HR) 65 bpm. Eupneic at rest and speech with headrest at 30o. Slight jugular ingurgitation. On auscultation, arrhythmic cardiac tones without audible murmurs. Bladder murmur preserved with no added pathological sounds. Lower limbs with slight perimalleolar oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis. No other noteworthy findings on examination.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: AF at 53 bpm. Narrow QRS with left anterior hemiblock morphology. Chest X-ray: significant cardiomegaly at the expense of left cavities with opening of the carinal angle above 90o, double right atrial contour and marked growth of left ventricular shadow showing a peculiar morphology of the cardiac tip in "hump" reminiscent of ventricular aneurysm. Normopositioned LAD. Transthoracic echocardiography: severely dilated left atrium. Globular left ventricle with end-diastolic diameter of 64 mm, end-diastolic volume of 256 ml and thinned walls with non-compaction in septo-apical segments, without systolic thickening and with an overall ejection fraction of 15-20%. Thin mitral valve with good mobility and with grade II/IV regurgitation directed to the posterolateral wall. Thin trivalve aortic valve with mild regurgitation directed to the anterior mitral leaflet. Dilated right ventricle with end-diastolic diameter of 40 mm and TAPSE of 17 mm. Hypocontractility in lateral segments. Electrocatheter in the right ventricle. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with right atrium-right ventricle gradient of 37 mmHg. CORONARYGRAPHY: normal coronary arteries. RIGHT CATHETERISM: right atrium 18 mmHg, right ventricle 59/18 mmHg, pulmonary artery trunk 59/35-43 mmHg, pulmonary capillary pressure 35 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient 8 mmHg, cardiac output 3.7 l/min. Peripheral vascular resistance 2.16 Wood units. Thoracic-abdominal CT scan: Noteworthy is the presence of pseudonodular hypodense areas in the liver, at the level of segment II and between segments V and VI, with unspecific characteristics that could correspond to fibrotic areas, less likely patchy steatosis. DOPLER ultrasound of the supra-aortic trunks and lower limbs: no significant lesions. BLOOD GROUP A. Anti-HLA I-II antibodies negative. SEROLOGY: hepatitis C IgG negative, hepatitis A IgG positive, hepatitis B S antigen negative, anti-HBs IgG negative, anti-HBc IgG negative. Positive IgG antibodies against mumps virus, rubella, measles, herpes virus type 1, varicella zoster and cytomegalovirus. IgG toxoplasma positive, IgM toxoplasma negative. IgG tetanus positive. HIV 1-2 negative. IgG Epstein Bar virus negative, IgM negative. Syphilis screening negative. TUMOUR MARKERS: negative. ANALYTICS pretransplant: glucose, renal function, abdominal profile and ions normal. Haemoglobin 11.3 g/dl. HbA1c 5.5%. NT-proBNP 1297 pg/ml. Coagulation with INR 1.31, PT 14.5 seconds, TPTA 57.1 seconds, TPTA ratio 1.78. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 185 mg/dl, LDL 95 mg/dl, HDL 65 mg/dl. Normal thyroid profile. COAGULATION TEST after idarucizumab IV infusion: INR 1.13, PT 12.4 seconds, TPTA 30.3 seconds, TPTA ratio 0.95.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION On receiving the analytical results requested on admission, the effect of dabigatran on the patient's coagulation was confirmed by means of the TPTA (57.1 seconds) and TPTA ratio (1.78). At this point, haematology was contacted to reverse the anticoagulation, who indicated the administration of 5 g of idarucizumab IV by means of two consecutive infusions of 2.5 g/50 ml in 5-10 minutes each, with a new control 15 minutes after administration, normalising the coagulation times (TPTA 30.3 seconds and TPTA ratio 0.97). Once the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran had been reversed, surgery was performed and orthotopic heart transplantation was performed using the bicava technique. The extracorporeal surgery time is 78 minutes and the anoxia time is 60 minutes. During surgery, 3 g of fibrinogen was administered and the patient did not require transfusions of blood products. Heparinisation is reversed with protamine. Finally, two mediastinal drains were left in place and were removed 48 hours after surgery without incident. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. He was extubated in the first 6 hours, with a favourable evolution at all times, with no bleeding complications. The usual immunosuppression protocol was started (tacrolimus + mycophenolate mofetil + prednisone). He was transferred to the cardiac transplant hospitalisation unit 72 hours after surgery and was discharged home early.  DIAGNOSIS Scheduled admission for orthotopic heart transplant with bicava technique in a patient on the elective waiting list for non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular dysfunction (LVEF 15-20%). Persistent anticoagulated AF (CHA2DS2-VASc 1 point, HAS-BLED 0 points). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

ECOCARDIOGRAM (outpatient, 5 months after discharge) (video 4): LV of normal size and thickness, without alterations of segmental contractility and preserved systolic function. Normal diastolic pattern for age. RV of normal size and function. Mild mitral insufficiency. Mild-moderate tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating a PSAP of 24 mmHg + PVC. Laboratory tests at the clinic: LDL cholesterol 100 mg/dl, HbA1c 6.5%. Cardiac NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MRI) (outpatient after control echocardiography): LV and RV images were obtained in cine sequences, Stir and late enhancement after gadolinium administration. LV: normal size, with VTD of 64 ml/m2 (range 41-81 ml/m2) and STV of 18 ml/m2 (range 12-21 ml/m2). EF 71%, cardiac output 5.4 l/min and stroke volume 88 ml. Normal segmental contractility.

Pressure gradient 4.5 mmHg. Pericardium: no significant pericardial thickening or effusion. Conclusions: LV of normal size and function. No significant hypertrophy (maximum thickness 12 mm) and no evidence of infiltrative cardiomyopathy.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Electrocardiogram and laboratory tests were performed with markers of myocardial damage (creatine kinase and ultrasensitive troponin T) with elevation of these markers. In view of these findings and with the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) type 2 in the context of hypertensive emergency, admission was decided for adjustment of treatment and completion of studies. An echocardiogram was performed showing severe concentric hypertrophy causing a dynamic gradient at the LV outflow tract and a complete serological study, given the recent onset of symptoms, in order to try to exclude a possible infectious origin, which was negative, as well as coronary angiography, given the mobilisation of markers of myocardial damage without evidence of significant angiographic lesions. The patient progressed favourably after starting antihypertensive treatment with a combination of olmesartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide (40/5/12.5mg) and beta-blocker (bisoprolol 2,5mg), so in view of the results it was decided to discharge him home and a possible diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or hypertensive heart disease with severe left ventricular hypertrophy was established, and to try to establish the differential diagnosis, an outpatient cardiac MRI was requested. Simultaneously, treatment was started with metformin 850 mg/12 hours and rosuvastatin 20 mg every 24 hours, based on the results of the analytical controls. Three months after discharge, she visited the cardiology outpatient clinic for a check-up. She required a progressive decrease in antihypertensive medication and at the time of consultation was treated with amlodipine 5 mg and bisoprolol 2.5 mg with optimal control of BP and ambulatory values maintained at around 120/60 mmHg. The physical examination revealed that the systolic murmur that had been present on admission had disappeared, so it was decided to request an ABPM that confirmed optimal control of BP and an echocardiogram with normalisation of wall thicknesses and no other relevant alterations. Finally, cardiac MRI was performed, showing a LV of normal size and thickness with no evidence of pathological gadolinium uptake, either early or late, so structural heart disease was ruled out and a definitive diagnosis of resolved myocarditis was established.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocarditis in resolution. Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Hypercholesterolemia type dyslipidaemia. Newly diagnosed arterial hypertension (AHT). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND: 74-year-old woman. Arterial hypertension. Rheumatic heart disease with predominantly mitral insufficiency. Mitral valve replacement by mechanical prosthesis Bjork no. 31 in 1976. 31 in 1976. Pacemaker implantation due to symptomatic slow atrial fibrillation in 1996 with last generator replacement in 2015, presenting on that occasion with spontaneously draining bursa haematoma with negative blood cultures and normal TTE, which was covered empirically with ampicillin + intravenous gentamicin with good subsequent evolution. Chronic treatment: acenocoumarol according to schedule, olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg c/24 hours, verapamil 120 mg c/24 hours, zolpidem 10 mg c/24 hours, formoterol/budesodin 160/4.5 mcg inh c/24 hours.  CURRENT ILLNESS: She attended the emergency department on 10/3/2016 for general malaise, headache, arthomyalgia, anorexia, fever and weight loss of 2 weeks' evolution. Initial suspicion of pneumonia in the left upper lobe led to empirical antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin, escalating to imipenem due to persistent febrile syndrome and general deterioration, in addition to finding growth of Streptococcus gordinii in blood cultures.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 36 oC. Blood pressure 126/63 mmHg, heart rate 66 bpm, oxygen saturation 97% with nasal goggles at 2 l/min, RR 16 rpm. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Good general condition. Eupneic at rest. Good distal perfusion, adequate hydric status. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds with prosthetic click without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: rhonchi, minimal crackles in the left base. Lower extremities: no oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: ventricular rhythm stimulated by pacemaker at 60 bpm. THORAX X-RAY: condensation at the level of the left upper lobe. ANALYSIS: Haemogram: Hb 10 g/dl. Leukocytes 24,300 u/l (neutrophils 85%, lymphocytes 8%), platelets 201,000 u/l. Biochemistry: glucose 135 mg/dl. Urea 54 mg/dl. Creatinine 1.28 mg/dl. GFR 41 ml/min. Sodium 132 mmol/l. Potassium 4.4 mmol/l. C-reactive protein 211 mg/l. CPK 119 U/l. Troponin T 19 ng/l (normal). Coagulation: PT 16 s. INR 4.2. Fibrinogen 905 mg/dl. Blood gases: pH 7.47, pO2 68 mmHg, pCO2 29 mmHg, SatO2 97%. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): endocarditis on mitral prosthetic valve. Bjork mechanical prosthesis in mitral position with no signs of dysfunction. In the posterior portion of the annulus (close to the atrial appendage) there is an anechoic cavity of pulsatile appearance of approximately 2.6 cm x 1.6 cm with images of greater density in its interior, suggesting an abscess in the clinical context of the patient. Left ventricle (LV) neither dilated nor hypertrophic LVEF 58%. Right ventricle (RV) not dilated, normal global contractility. Both atria moderately dilated. Normofunctioning aortic valve. Tricuspid normal, mild insufficiency. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP) 50 mmHg + 15-20 mmHg (severe pulmonary hypertension). Pericardium without effusion. Right pleural effusion. Inferior vena cava slightly dilated with respiratory variation present. Pacemaker electrode in right ventricle without apparent alterations. Chest PET-CT scan: hypermetabolism in the mitral region suggesting an infectious process, with no evidence of hypermetabolic foci in the path of the pacemaker lead. Uptake at the generator site (residual of recent replacement versus very low activity infection). Post-surgical changes in mitral valve with replacement by mechanical prosthesis. Collection with contrast in its interior of 28 x 17 x 15 mm depending on the anterior portion of the mitral annulus, suggestive of pseudoaneurysm.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Due to persistent febrile syndrome and positive cultures for multisensitive Streptococcus gordinii, it was decided to perform the aforementioned studies. TTE showed an image on the atrial side in the lateral region of the mitral annulus suggestive of an abscess compatible with the diagnosis of endocarditis on the prosthetic valve. This finding was corroborated by PET/CT, which showed a collection in the anterior portion of the mitral annulus suggestive of pseudoaneurysm with hypercaptation at this level. Urgent surgical intervention was decided in June 2016 and an open abscess was found towards the left atrium at the level of leaflets A1-P1. In addition, on examining the mechanical prosthesis, there was evidence of restriction of the movement of the disc due to pannus with calcified mitral annulus, as well as part of the atrial wall. The abscess was closed with two stitches and a Perimount Edwards No 27 biological mitral prosthesis was implanted, as well as a generator replacement due to minimal hypercaptation, as seen on PET-CT. During her stay in hospital she evolved favourably, de-escalating antibiotic treatment and prescribing benzylpenicillin, with negative blood cultures for control and prosthetic material. She was asymptomatic and progressed well in hospital, so it was decided to discharge her and continue outpatient follow-up, completing antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin for two months.  DIAGNOSIS Infectious endocarditis due to multisensitive Streptococcus gordinii on mechanical mitral prosthesis complicated by mitral periannular abscess. Replacement of mechanical mitral prosthesis with Perimount Edwards No 27 biological mitral prosthesis. Replacement of pacemaker generator due to suspected pacemaker pocket infection. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Rest within normality.  Evolution Admitted to ICU on 18/09/2012 with the diagnosis of septic shock of unidentified aetiology, with urinary focus as the most likely, requiring low doses of inotropics and vasopressors. Five hours later, the patient is haemodynamically stable, and inotropes and vasopressors can be withdrawn. However, disorientation and somnolence persisted, with aphasia and new onset right hemiplegia. An urgent cranial CT scan was performed She was assessed by Neurology, without an invasive intravascular procedure due to a history of lumbar puncture in the previous 24 hours, and antiplatelet therapy with ASA was administered. Urgent TTE was performed, which revealed a non-dilated LV with severe MI. On 19/09/2012, in the morning, he presented with a deterioration in the level of consciousness, with clear pupillary asymmetry and decortication posture. OTI and connection to mechanical ventilation and a new cranial CT scan were required. Despite treatment, neurological deterioration progressed, and she remained intubated with only some trunk reflexes. There was no fever peak at any time. In the anamnesis of the relatives, there was no evidence of endocarditis.  TEE 19/09/2012 Lowly mobile vegetation and homogeneous density of 15x14 mm, with associated perforated aneurysm on the anterior mitral leaflet. Severe mitral insufficiency with 2 jets, one originating through the perforation of the aneurysm and directed towards the posterior wall of the left atrium with coanda effect, with another smaller one at the central level. Severe tricuspid regurgitation due to prolapse. Mild degenerative aortic regurgitation.  Cultures Blood cultures Collected on admission. Positive for Streptococcus mitis Sensitive to Penicillin, Amoxicillin, Ceftriaxone, Cotrimoxazole Resistant to Clindamycin and Erythromycin.  The clinical course progressed to brain death on 21/09/2012, 96 hours after admission to the ICU. A cervico-thoracic-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was requested, in case he could be considered a donor. Body CT scan: lesions in the spleen and right kidney compatible with small embolic infarcts.  DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS ON NATIVE MITRAL VALVE DUE TO STREPTOCOCCUS MITIS. SEVERE MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY DUE TO PERFORATION AT THE LEVEL OF THE ANTERIOR MITRAL LEAFLET VEGETATION. SEPTIC SHOCK. SEPTIC EMBOLISM AT CEREBRAL LEVEL WITH HAEMORRHAGIC TRANSFORMATION AND ENCEPHALIC DEATH. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 30-year-old man with a smoking rate of 10 packs/year; he began his illness 3 months previously with the presence of asthenia, adynamia, general malaise, diaphoresis, predominantly at night, and weight loss of 12 kg; subsequently, indurated, erythematous, slightly painful lesions appeared on the middle finger and first left eye, and fever. Physical examination revealed: fever, caries in the upper second molar and presence of lower dental plaque, systolic I/IV murmur radiating to the neck vessels and diastolic II/IV in the aortic focus, bounding pulse, Lyan's sign and femoral shot, increased volume and redness on the second phalange of the right hand finger; labs showed haemoglobin 13 g/dL, leukocytes 9,200/mm3, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 13%, platelets 320,000/mm3, glucose 121 mg/dL, ESR 46 mm/h and Creactive protein 5.1 mg/dL. The chest X-ray showed grade I cardiomegaly and the echocardiogram showed a calcified aorta with a slightly reduced valve opening (2.3 cm2), with masses on the leaflets of very mobile low reflectance, suggesting vegetations that condition moderate to severe insufficiency. Blood culture isolated streptococcus viridans on 3 occasions. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Personal history 81-year-old male patient. Moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ex-smoker since 1998, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus (DM). In 2010, severe aortic stenosis treated by bioprosthesis, whose postoperative period was complicated by respiratory infection, surgical wound infection and sternal dehiscence, reintervened 15 days after surgery. Moderate heart failure, Barthel index: 50 (moderate). In 2012, the patient had numerous episodes of enterococcal bacteraemia and was admitted to hospital on four occasions. Given the recurrence of the infection, an exhaustive study was carried out in search of possible foci of infection, with particular interest in the prosthetic valve, with only a gallium 67 scan performed in February 2013 showing hypercaptation in the right sternoclavicular joint, leading to a diagnosis of enterococcal sternal osteomyelitis and antibiotic treatment was completed with ampicillin for 4 weeks. Three days after returning home, the patient developed fever, general malaise, dyspnoea, increased cough and secretions and returned to the hospital.  CLINICAL OBSERVATION At the last admission before the current illness, he was diagnosed with sternal osteomyelitis due to enterococci.  Initially, third generation cephalosporin was administered, which was changed to ampicillin and finally to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. During this admission, up to 4 red blood cell concentrates were administered due to significant anaemisation and also due to extravasation coinciding with the administration of a blood transfusion.  - Physical examination: conscious and oriented, nourished and hydrated, chest pain, general malaise, pallor, sweating, dyspnoea, jugular ingurgitation and malleolar oedema. - Vital signs: blood pressure 120/60 mmHg, heart rate 70 bpm, temperature 39°C. - CBC: 20,700 mil/mm3 leukocytes, 8.5 g/dl haemoglobin, 199,000/mm3 platelets. Glucose 207 mg/dl, urea 109 mg/dl, creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, sodium 135 mEq/l, potassium 4.7 mEq/l, CRP 56 mg/L. - Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation at 70 bpm. - Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. - Auscultation: arrhythmic heart with aortic systolic murmur. Bilateral pulmonary rhonchi. - Blood gases: pO2 167, pCO2 133, pH 7.40, HCO3 20. - Blood cultures: Enterococcus faecalis was isolated. - Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram: In the posterior annulus of the mitral valve a mass image of 16 x 12 mm is observed. With echogenic borders that was not seen in the previous transesophageal echocardiogram in December 2012. - Provisional diagnosis: subacute enterococcal mitral endocarditis complicated by anaemia due to chronic disease, acute renal failure due to aminoglycosides, exacerbation of COPD due to nosocomial respiratory infection with Stenotrophomona maltophilia and organic brain syndrome. - Initial treatment: low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), furosemide, ampicillin, inhalers, oxygen therapy, rest, vital signs monitoring and oxygen saturation.  Evolution After being diagnosed with mitral endocarditis, the patient was treated for 6 weeks with ampicillin and 2 weeks with gentamicin; in the fourth week of admission, the patient suffered an exacerbation of his COPD due to a respiratory infection by Strenotrophomonas maltophilia, receiving treatment with cotrimoxazole for 2 weeks, achieving clinical and microbiological resolution of the episode. Due to the administration of this whole battery of antibiotics, he suffered acute renal failure due to aminoglycosides, but after discontinuation of treatment in the sixth week of treatment, this resolved. During admission, there was a progressive worsening of the patient's chronic anaemia associated with the subacute infectious disease and the prolonged administration of antibiotics, which led to the administration of three red blood cell concentrates. Between the third and fourth week, the patient's general condition worsened significantly, and the nursing team focused on addressing collaboration problems and diagnosing activity intolerance related to an imbalance between oxygen intake and demand, and on self-care diagnoses. The patient's haematocrit and haemoglobin figures improved markedly after resolution of the infectious process and administration of plasma derivatives. From the fifth week of treatment, the patient gradually recovers, and it is possible to work with him on the diagnoses of anxiety and deficient knowledge as well as to progressively increase the number of activities aimed at self-care. During his prolonged illness and numerous hospitalisations, in the last months of his hospital stay, the patient suffers a serious functional deterioration, being unable to ambulate and carry out basic activities of daily living; current Barthel index: 15 (Total).   Medical discharge Following resolution of the infectious process, he was discharged from hospital on 28 May 2013 and transferred to a medium-stay hospital for the purpose of rehabilitation. A half-stay hospital is a level of care used to complete the rehabilitation of patients with real possibilities of recovery, who require longer stays than those traditionally accepted in the hospital environment. The average stay in this centre is between 25 and 30 days, and the maximum stay should not exceed 3 months. The medical treatment received at discharge consisted of: rehabilitation, heparin, diuretics, inhalers (salbutamol and Seretide® 50/100 mcg), iron and vitamin B9. For several weeks prior to discharge, the patient did not require hypoglycaemic or antihypertensive treatment. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Male, 2 years and 6 months old. Previously healthy. Well fed. Good growth. Good neuropsychic development. Schooled. Received the corresponding vaccinations according to the country's Scheme Certificate. He has presented repeated skin infections diagnosed as impetigo secondary to insect bites and scratching, these infections were treated with antibiotic therapy.  His current illness began 3 days prior to admission with fever up to 39.7oC, partial refusal of food, weakness and tendency to sleep. Partial seizure with secondary generalisation. Consultation and admission with diagnosis of probable central nervous system (CNS) infection. On examination: soporous, febrile, haemoglobin O2 saturation (SatO2) measured with pulse oximeter of 98% with free flow mask. No polypnoea, no respiratory function. Good bilateral air entry, no rales. Heart rate 130cpm, well beat sounds without murmurs. Pulses present. Normotensive. Well perfused. Numerous impetiginised lesions on lower limbs predominantly on legs, some in crusted stage, others melisseria and scars of previous ones. Psychoneuromucular, no meningeal signs, tone and strength preserved, no motor deficits. Osteotendinous reflexes present and symmetrical in all four limbs. Initial laboratory tests: haemoglobin (Hb) 12.7 g/dL, leukocytosis (WBC) 14,100 elements/mm3, 78% polymorphonuclear (PMN), platelets 257,000 elements/mm3. C-reactive protein (CRP) 51.3 mg/l. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): WBC 50 /mm3 (mostly PMN), normal protein and glucuroraxia. A bacteriological study of CSF was performed and an investigation of viral agents of meningoencephalitis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was requested, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed within 48 hours of the onset of the disease, which was reported as normal. Hospitalised in the paediatric ward, treatment was started with ceftriaxone and acyclovir at the usual doses. He continued to be sleepy, irritable, tachycardia and dereprosy. New lesions on palms and soles were added and due to neurological compromise he was admitted to intermediate care (CIP). Examination on admission: Glasgow Scale (GSC) 15, irritable, SatO297% on air. Apiric, pustular indurated lesion on the anterior aspect of the right hemithorax, rest of the lesions already mentioned. Sinus tachycardia 167 bpm, no murmurs, normotensive, full pulses, recovery time (RT) less than 2 seconds. Good air entry, no rales. No neck or trunk rigidity. No motor deficit. The treatment started was maintained with the addition of vancomycin. Repeat blood tests showed an increase in CRP264 mg/dl, leukocytosis 4,600 elements/mm3, platelets 103,000 elements/mm3, mobilisation of liver enzymes: TGO 87 U/L, TGP 88 U/L. Normal glomerular renal function. Skin lesion and blood cultures showed sensitive Staphylococcus aureusmeticillinus (SAMS), CSF culture and PCR for Herpes virus were negative.  A few hours after admission, an intense systolic murmur was noted in the mesocardium. In view of the diagnosis of probable infective endocarditis with encephalic embolisation, a Doppler echocardiogram was performed, which showed "thickening of both leaflets in the mitral valve with a small image adhering to the septal leaflet compatible with vegetation. Mild to moderate mitral insufficiency. Good systolic function". Encephalic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows: "lesions compatible with septic embolism with moderate perilesional oedema". Other emboligenic foci were ruled out. Treatment was maintained with vancomycin and gentamicin in therapeutic range. The paediatric cardiac surgery team was consulted and initially maintained a wait-and-see attitude regarding the surgical approach, with serial controls with echocardiography. The patient was placed on apyrexia on the 17th day of treatment. Echocardiograms showed worsening mitral regurgitation and persistent vegetations. He repeated encephalic embolisation with left hemiplegia and a new MRI was performed which confirmed ischaemic infarction in the putamen area. After a joint assessment with the neuropaediatrician and heart surgeons, cardiac surgery was performed to clean the valve, attempting to repair it with pericardium, which failed, leaving the patient with a mechanical valve and hypocoagulation. Atrioventricular block requiring corticoids and external pacemaker for 15 days, later returning to sinus rhythm. Good evolution, with improvement of haemiparesis with physiotherapy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
55-year-old man with mitral and aortic biological valve prostheses (Bioimplant) since 1989. He was admitted in May 1996 for back pain, fever and general malaise of 4 weeks' duration, with clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis. Physical examination revealed fever of 38°C, apical impulse displaced laterally and inferiorly towards the anterior axillary line, rhythmic heart sounds of normal intensity with aortic systolic ejection murmur grade II/VI and mild splenomegaly. The admission blood test showed a white blood cell count of 11,300/μl (91% neutrophils) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 12 mm at one hour. The rest of the analytical parameters were within normal limits. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 70 beats/min, PR spacing 0.16. QRS axis at +60° and non-specific ventricular repolarisation disturbance from V4 to V6. Chest X-ray showed radiological grade I cardiomegaly with cardiothoracic index of 0.55. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed mitral prosthetic valve dysfunction with prolapse of one of its leaflets and mild-moderate regurgitation; aortic prosthetic valve dysfunction with mild prolapse and regurgitation; there was no definite evidence of endocardial vegetation. Six serial blood cultures were performed, and Staphylococcus capitis growth was detected in all of them. Specific antibiotic therapy was started, according to the antibiogram and in accordance with the therapeutic regimen recommended in the literature with vancomycin (30 mg/kg body weight i.v. every 24 h in four daily doses), rifampicin (300 mg v.o. every 8 h) both for six weeks and gentamicin (1 mg/kg body weight i.v. every 8 h) for two weeks 7 , with fever remitting on the third day of treatment. Six days after admission, the patient suffered a fleeting episode of dizziness, dysarthria, paraesthesia in the left hand, headache and generalised tremor. Cranial CT scan showed an image of cerebral infarction in the right temporoparietal region. Transesophageal echocardiography showed aortic and mitral valve vegetations, severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic regurgitation. Fifteen days after admission, the patient presented pain in the left hypochondrium and increased splenomegaly. An abdominal ultrasound and gallium-67 scintigraphy revealed the existence of a splenic infarction. Twenty-one days after admission, fever recurred, and a new blood test showed an elevated ESR up to 84 mm in the first hour and anaemia not present on admission with a haemoglobin of 9.8 mg/dl and a haematocrit of 28.7%. Given the patient's clinical evolution, surgery was decided, and the biological valve prostheses were replaced twice with new mechanical valve prostheses on day 30 of admission. The same antibiotherapy treatment regimen was continued for a further two weeks. Subsequent blood cultures showed no growth of microorganisms. The patient's clinical evolution was favourable and he was discharged from hospital 57 days after admission. It was not possible to identify the entry point of the germ. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 58-year-old man was admitted to the Cayetano Heredia Hospital with a 2-month history of vomiting, fever of 38°C and severe disabling back pain. Clinical examination revealed a multifocal holosystolic murmur, predominantly in the mitral focus of intensity III/VI, radiating to the axilla and neck. Positive Lasegue and Psoas sign, as well as positive Dandy sign at L3, L4 and L5.  Laboratory data obtained on admission were: haemoglobin: 12.2 g/dl, haematocrit: 38%, white blood cell count: 14.01/μl (neutrophils: 64.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 116 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP): 1/16 mg/l. Chest X-ray showed no signs of condensation. Similarly, the electrocardiographic tracing at rest showed no relevant alterations.  Transesophageal echocardiography revealed mitral and aortic valve involvement characterised by vegetations on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (atrial and ventricular surface of segment A2) and a 1.6 x 1.3 cm perforated aneurysm (0.7 cm) with severe regurgitation. Also, in the aortic valve, multiple vegetations were found in the three leaflets; the largest measuring 0.9 cm, with severe regurgitation and flow compatible with perforation of the posterior semilunar leaflet.  Streptococcus gordonnii was isolated in blood cultures. Additionally the lumbosacral MRI showed vertebral osteomyelitis of L4-L5.  During the surgical procedure, the aforementioned findings were confirmed and the aortic and mitral bivalvular replacement was performed with the implantation of mechanical prostheses. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 43-year-old man, with no clinical history of interest, who 2 months prior to his diagnosis began a subacute episode of a peak fever of 39°C, predominantly in the evening, and pain, swelling and functional impotence in the right hand and left ankle. Physical examination revealed pain on palpation and inflammatory signs at the level of the carpus, second, third, fourth and fifth right metacarpophalangeal joints and left ankle with painful limitation of mobility in the first degrees in all arcs of movement, as well as auscultation of a diastolic murmur in the aortic focus. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory tests showed: leukocytosis (16,000) with neutrophilia (85%); ESR, 52 mm/h, and CRP, 4.6 mg/dl. Haemostasis and biochemistry were normal. In the immunological study, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, immunoglobulins and complement were negative, as was serology for viruses and bacteria. Blood cultures were performed after the first febrile peak and before initiation of antibiotic therapy and were positive for Enterococcus faecalis. Chest X-ray showed a discrete bilateral pleural effusion and echocardiography showed severe aortic insufficiency with thickening of the valvular leaflets. With the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis due to E. faecalis, intravenous antibiotherapy with ampicillin and gentamicin was started, with progressive improvement of joint symptoms and fever and imaging findings, until the patient became asymptomatic. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Female patient, aged 60 years, resident of Mexico City. She was admitted to the Hospital de Cardiología del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in Mexico City in February 2017, referred from another hospital with a diagnosis of probable IE. The patient presented with fever of unknown origin, intermittent, up to 39.7 °C, accompanied by diaphoresis and chills for 24 months of evolution, as well as vegetations on the aortic valve demonstrated by echocardiography. According to Duke's criteria, it was concluded that he had IE of aetiology to be determined. He had a smoking rate of 1.5 packs/year, occasional alcoholism without becoming intoxicated and rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed in 2012, treated with chloroquine 150 mg/24 hours, prednisone 2.5 mg/24 hours and cyclosporine 100 mg/24 hours.  The following studies were performed at the Cardiology Hospital: transthoracic echocardiography (TTEE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TTEE), corroborating the existence of two vegetations on the aortic valve smaller than 10 mm in diameter; scintigraphy and scintigraphy studies demonstrated the presence of hepato-splenomegaly. Laboratory tests including blood biometry, blood chemistry, coagulation times, blood grouping, immunology and blood cultures showed the following results: normocytic normochromic anaemia ranging from 8 to 11.3 g/dL, persistent thrombocytopenia (48 and 122 x 103/μL), leukopenia ranging from 2 to 3.8 x 103/μL, prothrombin time prolongation ranging from 7 to 28.7 seconds, partial thromboplastin time prolongation ranging from 9 to 118.2 seconds, positive anti-toxoplasma IgG and anti-cytomegalovirus IgG. The rest of the studies were within normal reference ranges.  Three blood cultures processed by the BacT/ALERT 3D system were performed and showed no microbiological growth. Although the blood cultures processed by the automated method were negative, and given the clinical and imaging suspicion of IE, according to the treatment criteria for intracardiac vegetations (< 10 mm), the patient was managed with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and amikacin for 14 days.  At the control ECTT performed at the end of February, it was observed that the vegetations had increased in diameter: one measured 14 x 8 mm and the other 4 x 5 mm, so in March 2017 she underwent vegectomy and biological aortic valve implantation. The patient was discharged from the Cardiology Hospital in April 2017, with treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, as well as acetylsalicylic acid and metoprolol.  During his in-hospital stay, as part of a research protocol, a manual blood culture was performed using the lysis-centrifugation method, which, according to previous publications, increases the isolation of fungi. From the sediment obtained with this technique, a white, filamentous, cottony colony developed, whose direct examination with cotton blue showed septate hyaline filaments, with vesicular cells in chains, without conidia; microscopic examination of the subculture showed the same structures.  In the absence of morphological structures to guide identification, molecular biology procedures were used. DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (ExgeneTM Plant SV, Gene All, Biotechnology CO, Korea), following the manufacturer's instructions. By PCR, the ITS-D1D2 region was amplified with primers ITS1 (5"-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3") and ITS4 (5"-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATATGC-3"). PCR was performed with 100 ng of DNA; denaturation temperature of 96 °C for 5 minutes; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 seconds, 58 °C for 30 seconds and 72 °C for 30 seconds; final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The amplification product was 620 base pairs (bp), which was purified and sequenced. The sequence received was compared in the Genebank database, resulting in 100% identity with Histoplasma capsulatum (Sequence ID: KX646015.1). It is important to mention that the fungal development of the blood culture with the lysis-centrifugation technique occurred after the patient's discharge.  Histopathological study of the vegetations, with PAS and Grocott stains, performed by the Department of Pathological Anatomy of the Cardiology Hospital, showed the presence of two types of fungal structures: yeasts of 2 to 3 μm in diameter and septate, tortuous filaments of approximately 5 μm in diameter and variable length. Given the evidence of H. capsulatum IE, the patient was treated with itraconazole, 300 mg/day. To date, quarterly check-ups have shown no alterations suggesting persistence of the infection. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 9-year-old girl was hospitalised with fever and headache for two days. She was being followed up for a small congenital VSD (diameter 3 mm). She had no history of dental or surgical procedures. On physical examination, body temperature: 38.5°C, respiratory rate: 20/min, pulse: 110/min, blood pressure: 100/60 mmHg. An intense holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and signs of nuchal rigidity and positive Kernig's signs were also noted. The child had no other relevant features. She had no subungual haemorrhages, no splenomegaly and no obvious focal neurological impairment. Laboratory data were as follows: leucocyte count 17 000/mm3; neutrophils 93 %; lymphocytes 5 %; haemoglobin 12.7 g/dl; thrombocytes 225 000/mm3; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 40 mm/h and C-reactive protein 10 mg/dl. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) count was 22 neutrophils/mm3, 66 lymphocytes/mm3, protein content 26 mg/dl and glucose 61 mg/dl. MRI was unremarkable. Ceftriaxone was started due to suspicion of meningitis after a lumbar puncture. By day 3 of hospitalisation, symptoms had completely resolved. Once negative results were obtained on CSF Gram stain, PCR panel for bacterial/viral meningitis, blood culture and urine culture, ceftriaxone was discontinued and the patient was discharged on day 7. Two days later, she was readmitted with fever (39.5°C) and stiff neck. Laboratory tests showed the following: leukocytes 25 000/mm3 (92 % neutrophils with toxic granulations), haemoglobin 11 g/dl, thrombocytes 216 000/mm3, ESR 55 mm/h and C-reactive protein 16 mg/dl. On physical examination, no obvious source of fever was found. The family refused CSF examination. An echocardiogram was performed to detect the origin of the fever and found tricuspid valve endocarditis with vegetation (10.7 mm x 6.6 mm) and VSD (diameter 3 mm) with left-to-right shunt. Cranial CT scan was normal. On follow-up, the nuchal rigidity resolved within 24 hours. Two consecutive blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and teicoplanin and gentamicin were started. Vegetation on the tricuspid valve caused valvular insufficiency and was removed by heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, including tricuspid valvuloplasty four weeks later. Antibiotics were discontinued after six weeks, after blood cultures were negative for two weeks. The patient was discharged with residual mild tricuspid regurgitation. During the one-year follow-up, she was symptom-free. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An 8-year-old boy, with no clinical history of interest, consulted the emergency department for a clinical picture of fever up to 39.5 oC of 14 days' evolution, associated with chills, pale skin, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, weakness and lack of appetite. He had been treated with azithromycin 500 mg daily for five days. Physical examination revealed the presence of a grade II/III systolic murmur in the auscultatory focus corresponding to the left ventricle. The electroencephalogram and chest X-ray showed no pathological findings. Laboratory tests showed the presence of inflammatory markers: leukocytes of 10,500 cells/ml, a neutrophilia of 70% and an elevated CRP (119 mg/L). Treatment was started with cefotaxime i.v. 200 mg/kg/day after serial blood cultures on two consecutive days. After 24 h of incubation, both blood cultures were positive. Gram stain showed pleomorphic gram-positive bacilli in a "V" shape. Direct identification of the organism from the positive blood cultures by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was C. pseudodiphtheriticum. In this context, echocardiography was performed, showing a 10 mm vegetative formation (Figure 1) on the left ventricular side, causing moderate insufficiency, without repercussions on haemodynamics and cardiac function. The presence of bicuspid aortic valve disease was also noted. With the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, gentamicin (6 mg/kg/day) was added to therapy pending definitive identification of the microorganism and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile. After 24 h of incubation on solid culture media, the growth of grey colonies on blood agar plates, catalase positive, was observed. Identification by 16S RNA gene sequencing confirmed the isolation of Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum. Epsilometric antibiogram (E-test) showed resistance to azithromycin (MIC > 256 μg/ml) and sensitivity (MIC) to amoxicillin/ac. clavulanic acid (0.016 μg/ml), cefotaxime (0.38 μg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.5 μg/ml), linezolid (0.016 μg/ml), penicillin G (0.25 μg/ml) and vancomycin (0.38 μg/ml).The patient's clinical course was favourable, with remission of his febrile symptoms within 48 h of initiation of combined antimicrobial therapy. Given his good evolution, with negative blood cultures and no imaging changes, cardiac surgery was not considered at that time, unless there was any clinical deterioration. Sixteen days after hospitalisation, the patient again presented fever associated with frontal headache, disorientation and poor motor tone that evolved into right brachial paresis, right hemicara and aphasia. The picture was interpreted as a cerebral septic embolism. Linezolid was added to the antimicrobial treatment for possible superinfection by resistant microorganisms in another focus. Given the risk of a new embolism, cardiac surgery was performed on the aortic valve territory (Ross procedure), which was successfully completed. On the third post-operative day, the patient developed intracranial hypertension. A brain MRI was performed which revealed an ischaemic infarction due to occlusion at the origin of the left middle cerebral artery. Due to its severity, the patient died in the following days. The final microbiological results again confirmed the isolation of C. pseudodiphtheriticum in blood cultures. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
89-year-old woman, with no known history, consulted for a 15-day history of fever of 39 degrees, asthenia, adynamia, urinary symptoms in the last week, medicated with ciprofloxacin 500mg every 12 hours until the day before hospitalisation, who, due to persistent thermal rises, went to the emergency room. Physical examination findings: pale conjunctivae, tachycardic, rhythmic, normo-phonemic heart sounds, regurgitant murmur in mitral focus II/VI, non-radiated, with abdominal distention, fighting sounds, palpable mass of 4 x 4 cm in the left iliac fossa.  Laboratory on admission: leukocytes: 13,300mm3, neutrophils 77%, haemoglobin: 6.8mg/dl, haematocrit: 21.6mg/dl, ESR: 109MM, CRP: (++). Urine culture and blood cultures were performed, and a CT scan of the abdomen was requested, which revealed the presence of a bilobulated formation of apparent gynaecological origin, which to the left showed an image suggestive of a fistula with a loop of small intestine, with oral contrast substance inside the lesion. With a presumptive diagnosis of perforated tumour with intestinal fistula, the patient was taken to the operating theatre and antibiotic treatment was started, covering the abdominal focus. Since the patient continued to be febrile, together with positive blood culture results for Escherichia coli, an echocardiogram was requested, which revealed a rounded image measuring 1.5x0.8 millimetres that could correspond to vegetation, so treatment was started with ceftriaxone plus gentamicin, with good clinical evolution, and the patient was subsequently discharged. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 76-year-old man with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and chronic renal failure. The patient came to the emergency department of our centre with general malaise, nausea, vomiting and episodes of profuse sweating without chest pain. Five days earlier he had been discharged from hospital after two stents had been placed for ischaemic heart disease. She was admitted with leukocytosis with left shift, acute renal failure, normochromic normocytic anaemia and a CRP of 112mg/L. The electrocardiogram showed complete right bundle branch block and second-degree atrioventricular block. During the first days of admission to the ICU he was afebrile, with rising leukocytosis without clear focus, and showing some episodes of temporospatial disorientation with psychomotor agitation. Treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was started and a cranial CT scan was performed showing a small occipital subarachnoid haemorrhage. On the sixth day of admission, the patient presented fever over 38oC, with tachypnoea and increased respiratory work with severe metabolic acidosis, accompanied by a deterioration in the level of consciousness. A chest CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusion. Urine, bronchial aspirate and blood samples were collected for culture. The following day the microbiology laboratory reported that two blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in clusters which were later identified as Staphylococcus lugdunensis not producing beta-lactamase. Following this result, antibiotic treatment was adjusted according to the antibiogram to cloxacillin and gentamicin. A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, showing two vegetations on the atrial side of the mitral valve, one in the septal leaflet measuring 12 x 12 mm and the other in the posterior leaflet measuring 13 x 12 mm, indicating moderate mitral insufficiency. Surgery for valve replacement was considered, but the patient died before surgery could be performed. The patient was diagnosed with mitral endocarditis on native valve. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In June 2010, a 61-year-old man came to the internal medicine department for the study of an almost daily febrile fever and occasionally a fever of over 38oC. His personal history included: hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, haemochromatosis under treatment with periodic bleeding up to a year earlier, ex-smoker, and a patient with a prosthetic mitral valve and stent since 2008 due to ischaemic heart disease with biventricular involvement.  Six months earlier, the patient had started to experience a progressive onset of fever, asthenia, hyporexia and cough. In March of the same year, he was referred by his primary care physician for the finding of three peripheral pulmonary micronodules measuring 5 mm. Complementary examinations revealed moderate normochromic anaemia, elevated ESR and CRP together with significant homogeneous splenomegaly. No fever was noted and he was discharged to continue the study in the outpatient department. In April he returned to the ED with fever of 38.7oC and pleuritic pain in the left hemithorax. Two blood cultures were taken and were negative after 5 days of incubation. He started empirical antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid with partial improvement of symptoms. From the Internal Medicine department and due to a further worsening of symptoms, it was decided to admit him. At that time he was anaemic, with iron levels of 34 mcg/dl, a blood rate of 56 mm/h and CRP of 3.6 mg/dl. Thoracic-abdominal CT showed splenomegaly with an image compatible with splenic infarcts and persistence of the aforementioned unchanged pulmonary micronodules. A transesophageal echocardiogram showed a mechanical mitral prosthesis with two vegetation images, a medial one measuring 14 x 5 mm and a lateral one measuring 13 x 4 mm on the atrial side. There was no prosthetic dysfunction. Three blood cultures were taken (aerobic and anaerobic flasks). All three anaerobic flasks grew a non-spore-forming, pleomorphic gram-positive bacillus at 7, 8 and 10 days. The isolate was sent to the Centro Nacional de Microbiología in Majadahonda where it was identified as Propionibacterium acnes by amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. When initially reporting the growth of an anaerobic gram-positive bacillus in blood cultures, the patient was treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and gentamicin. Subsequently, ceftriaxone and gentamicin were replaced by clindamycin. After suspecting that the microorganism was P. acnes, it was decided to change antibiotherapy to penicillin G sodium, 4,000,000 IU every 4 hours. The patient's evolution at the start of treatment was favourable, but the reappearance of fever with peaks above 38oC after ten days, together with the results of a second transesophageal echocardiogram (unchanged from the previous one), made it advisable to perform surgery to replace the prosthesis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient was a 64-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital with erythematous lesions on both hands and swelling, pain and functional impotence of the right wrist joint. She had a biological aortic valve prosthesis, implanted fifteen months before the current consultation. Examination of the patient revealed that she was febrile (38oC) and Osler nodules were observed on the hands and feet, as well as nail haemorrhages. Blood tests showed leukocytosis (12.8 x 106/L). Blood cultures were taken and a chest ultrasound showed a large vegetation on the prosthetic valve annulus. She was diagnosed with prosthetic valve endocarditis and treatment was started with vancomycin, gentamicin and rifampicin at appropriate doses. After two days of evolution, the patient showed decreased level of consciousness and right hemiparesis. A normal head CT scan and lumbar puncture were performed. CSF biochemistry showed no alterations and a sample was sent to the Microbiology Department. It was decided to perform surgery for a new valve replacement, but the patient died eight hours later due to cardiorespiratory arrest, before she could be operated on. No autopsy was performed. Blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid were negative after seven days of incubation. Blind passages of blood cultures were given and all culture media sown showed whitish cream coloured colonies with a membranous appearance after three days of incubation. Microscopic examination revealed yeasts, short filaments and arthroconidia.  The micro-organism grew in the subculture after 72 h of incubation on standard culture media. The vast majority of yeasts that cause infections in humans can have these characteristics. However, Candida species usually grow within 24 h on standard media, so the yeast may be thought to belong to a slow-growing species (Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, Rhodotorula, Geotrichum, Galactomyces). The macroscopic appearance of the colonies (cream-coloured and membranous appearance) helps to rule out pigmented yeasts such as Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces, which are red and orange, respectively. However, the most significant data is the microscopic morphology (yeast-like organisms, with hyphae and arthroconidia). The presence of hyphae helps to rule out a genus such as Cryptococcus which does not usually produce filaments. The presence of arthroconidia helps to make a presumptive identification. Arthroconidia are a type of asexual reproduction, consisting of the generation of conidia by simple fragmentation of the hyphae in the area where the septa are located. It is typical of several species belonging to the genera Trichosporon, Galactomyces and Geotrichum.  Within the arthroconidial group, three species cause the vast majority of infections in humans: Galactomyces geotrichum (Geotrichum candidum), Dipodascus capitatus (Geotrichumcapitatum) and Trichosporon beigelii. The latter can be considered as a genospecies and in recent taxonomic classifications has been divided into multiple species, of which at least 6 are pathogenic to humans (T. asahii, T. cutaneum, T. inkin, T. mucoides, T. ovoides and T. asteroides). Of these, T. asahii is the most important from a pathogenic point of view, as it is the one that causes almost all cases of deep Trichosporon infections. To distinguish between the three arthroconidial species requires morphological study, biochemical tests and complementary techniques. Macroscopic morphology does not help to differentiate between the three species, as the colonies of all species are white or cream coloured and membranous in appearance. Microscopic morphology is somewhat more specific, although not definitive, as sometimes only hyphae and arthroconidia are observed. The microscopic morphology of D. capitatus is characterised by narrow hyphae branching at acute angles, with anelloconidia and endospores. G. geotrichum usually has thicker hyphae branching at right angles. T. beigelii has a variable morphology as it is a genospecies.  Generally speaking, it usually has fine disarticulated hyphae, with abundant formacubic and sometimes appressoria (narrow filamentous structures, attached to the hyphae and branching very irregularly) and giant spindle cells. Both biochemical tests and complementary techniques are used as confirmatory methods of identification. Trichosporon species are easily distinguished from Galactomyces and Dipodascus as they assimilate a large number of carbohydrates and produce urea hydrolysis. G. geotrichum and D. capitatus assimilate fewer carbohydrates (glucose, galactose and some others depending on the strain) and do not hydrolyse urea. These two species can be distinguished because Galactomyces does not usually grow well at 37oC and because many strains also assimilate xylose. None of the three species ferment carbohydrates. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 55-year-old man with a history of ischaemic heart disease attended the emergency department for fever of 6 months of intermittent evolution, accompanied by chills, sweating, asthenia and anorexia. On examination he presented a temperature of 39oC, septic mouth and rhythmic cardiac auscultation at 90 bpm with a multifocal systolic murmur III/VI. Laboratory tests showed haemoglobin 12.5 g/dL, haematocrit 37%, MCV 91 fL, white and platelet series normal, and CRP 9.0 mg/dL. Chest X-ray was normal. Serial blood cultures were taken and the patient was admitted. A transesophageal echocardiogram showed two warts in the anteroseptal mitral leaflet with mild mitral insufficiency. Empirical antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis was started with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (2 g/4 h, iv) and gentamicin (80 mg/8 h, iv). Seven days after admission, bacterial growth was detected in 3 of the 4 blood culture bottles. No microorganisms were observed in the direct Gram stain. At 48 hours, in the subculture performed on chocolate agar in a CO2 atmosphere, greyish-coloured punctate colonies grew, which corresponded to gram-negative coccobacilli in the Gram stain. Biochemical tests were as follows: catalase positive, oxidase negative, urea negative, indolnegative and non-fermenting of glucose, galactose and lactose. The micro-organism did not grow in aerobic atmosphere at 37oC or on EMB agar, but did grow on Brucella enanaerobiosis agar. A subculture was performed in thioglycollate broth and after 7 days of incubation, growth was observed in the form of clumps adhering to the wall of the tube and then becoming diffuse throughout the broth. Serological tests for Brucella were negative. Due to the microbiological results obtained and the appearance of new febrile episodes, it was decided to change the antibiotic treatment to ceftriaxone (2g/24 h, iv). The original culture was incubated for a prolonged period of time in a CO2 atmosphere and after 25 days rough colonies with a stellate appearance in the centre were observed by low magnification light microscopy. The sensitivity study was performed by the disc-plate method after prolonged incubation, resulting sensitive to penicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones, cotrimoxazole, rifampicin and tetracycline, and resistant to glycopeptides and clindamycin, being the determination of beta-lactamase negative. The patient's clinical evolution was satisfactory, with no complications. He was discharged and continued with outpatient antibiotic treatment, completing 5 weeks of treatment with ceftriaxone.  The existence of endocarditis with a subacute course and the late growth of gram-negative microorganisms in the blood culture should lead us to suspect the participation of microorganisms belonging to the HACEK group, which includes bacteria that are difficult to grow and have special nutritional and incubation requirements. This group includes the following microorganisms: Haemophilus (H. aphrophilus, H.paraphrophilus, etc.), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella kingae. The common characteristics of all of them are the following: they are part of the normal flora of the oropharyngeal cavity and upper respiratory tract, they are small gram-negative coccobacilli, they are demanding microorganisms, very slow growing, requiring prolonged incubation in a CO2 atmosphere and producing similar clinical pictures of insidious course, endocarditis being the most frequent pathology.  According to the microbiological results, A. actinomycetemcomitans was identified as the causative organism of this infection. It is a gram-negative, capnophilic, facultative anaerobic, very slow-growing coccobacillus, which is part of the normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity. It requires blood-enriched culture media and does not grow on selective media such as MacConkey agar or EMB.  Endocarditis due to A. actinomycetemcomitans is very rare on both native and prosthetic valves, with 102 cases reported in the literature so far. It is the microorganism of the HACEK group that most frequently causes endocarditis, especially in patients with underlying cardiac pathologies. The entry point is usually an oropharyngeal infection, but it can also be secondary to instrumentation in the oral cavity. On other occasions, as in our case, the origin is related to a septic mouth with teeth in poor condition.  A. actinomycetemcomitans is sensitive to cephalosporins, aztreonam, rifampicin, aminoglycosides, aminoglycosides, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and quinolones, with variable sensitivity to penicillin. In endocarditis caused by this microorganism, the most commonly used treatment regimen has been the combination of penicillin or ampicillin with an intravenous aminoglycoside, although penicillinase-producing strains have been described. For this reason, third-generation cephalosporins, associated with either rifampicin or an aminoglycoside, are an option to consider due to their excellent in vitro activity. The recommended duration of treatment is 4 weeks in endocarditis on native valves and 6 weeks when prosthetic valves are affected. The use of fluoroquinolones, as well as cotrimoxazole or aztreonam, should be considered as an alternative in patients who are intolerant or allergic to beta-lactams, given their high sensitivity rates and the in vitro demonstration of synergy with rifampicin. Isolated cases of complete cure have been reported after treatment with oral ciprofloxacin, alone or in association with rifampicin or doxycycline, for a longer period of time than with parenteral treatments (8 weeks). These data suggest that oral fluoroquinolones may be a valid option, as monotherapy or in combination with other antimicrobials, in episodes of A. actinomycetemcomitans endocarditis without serious complications. Valve replacement is necessary in 24% of cases. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

69-year-old man. History of biological AVR 9 months earlier. Native of CABA, with no relevant epidemiological history. Evaluated for fever and intermittent chills of 2 months of evolution. Samples were taken for HC which were repeatedly negative; TEE: anechoic image compatible with drained abscess in mitroaortic fibrosa territory; PET-CT: hypercaptation at perivalvular level. He underwent empirical antibiotic treatment with Daptomycin 10 mg/kg/day + Ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 6 weeks with a diagnosis of probable early Ao IVPVD with negative HC. As the patient progressed favourably, it was decided not to perform surgery during the hospitalisation. Two months after completion of ATB treatment, she returned with fever and chills. HC again negative and TEE with progression of the perivalvular lesion, it was decided to perform surgery. Perivalvular sample was sent for culture, AP and PCR in which C. burnetti was detected by 16S DNA sequencing. Serology by IFA for Coxiella IgG 1/256. Treatment with Doxycycline 200 mg/day + Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day was started. During his evolution and without ever being able to go outside, he suffers multiple complications associated with health care, which lead to his death 5 months after surgery. Coxiella burnetti is a rare cause of IE. It should be suspected especially in patients with negative HC and specific epidemiological factors such as contact with cattle, sheep and goats. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 59-year-old male with a high fever (39o) of 2 days' evolution and an episode of convulsive crisis. He appears stuporous.  BP 97/80 mmHg. Fc 132 bpm. SatO2 95%. Fr 22 rpm. Ta 34,2oC.  Fulfils criteria of SEPSIS SERIOUS: Ta34,2o. Acute renal failure (Creatinine 2,2); elevated PCT and CRP (bacterial infection); Hypotension (97/80) with signs of poor perfusion (cold and sweaty), Metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), elevated lactate (hypoperfusion); Oligoanuria; very striking Plateletopenia (16.000); Tachycardia (AF at 132 x ́), Tachypnoea at 26 x ́(low pCO2). The FOCO is unknown.  Let's go by parts:  1) Sepsis-induced hypotension: 2,000 cc of Physiological Serum is administered and later in ICU 1,500 cc SF. -> maintains BP 105/75  2) Atrial fibrillation at 130 x ́ -> AMIODARONE IV .... -> Sinus rhythm.  3) Antibiotic? After 2 blood cultures -> MEROPENEM IV, -> CLOXACILLIN + CEFOTAXIME + CYPROFLOXACIN was chosen in ICU. -> and subsequently: CLOXACILLIN + DAPTOMYCIN -> currently CLOXACILLIN + GENTAMYCIN.  4) Convulsive crisis that recurred after a few hours. CT scan: SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE, probably related to plateletopenia or mycotic (= infectious) aneurysm -> start treatment with IV LEVETIRACETAM.  5) Plateletopenia. -> Consultation with haematology: "does not meet criteria for TTP, HIT or haemophagocytic syndrome; ITP versus vasculitis is not ruled out in addition to the septic picture". Treatment was started with corticoids + platelet perfusion: a daily pool.  6) Search for FOCO: transthoracic echocardiogram was performed: NO warts were visualised.  7) Blood cultures positive for STAPHILOCOCCUS AUREUS (sensitive to methicillin)  8) Transesophageal echocardiogram was carried out: an image of VERRUGE in the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve was visualised.  9) Consultation with Cardiovascular Surgery: surgical treatment was ruled out at the present time due to SAH. Reassessment after 6 weeks.  10) Appearance of purpuric lesions (ecchymotic) of probable embolic origin on the tips of the fingers and soles of the feet.  After a week in ICU, she remained stable. She was transferred to the ward.  DIAGNOSTIC JUDGEMENT:  - Myxomatous myxomatous degeneration due to S. AUREUS.  - SEVERE SEPSIS with RENAL FAILURE (corrected at discharge). SEVERE PLATELETOPENIA.  - SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE. Generalised EPILEPTIC CRISIS  - ACxFA (reverted to sinus rhythm)  Commentary: Staphylococcus aureus: S.Aureus lives on human skin -> causes skin infections: folliculitis, impetigo, skin abscesses, furunculosis, mastitis, cellulitis, wound infection...(also surgical wounds).... |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Chest X-ray: no evidence of acute pleuropulmonary pathology. Loss of right lung volume and metallic density material in the lower portion of the ipsilateral hemithorax in relation to surgical history. Cardiopericardial silhouette of normal size. Annular calcifications projecting on the cardiac silhouette, already present in the previous study. CBC: leukocytes 2,890/uL (N 50.2 %, L 34.9 %). Hb 12.9 g/dl. Platelets 93,000/uL. INR 1.12. TPPA Ratio 1.12. Glucose 83 mg/dl. Urea 65 mg/dl. Creat 0.74 mg/dl. Na 143. K 4.5. Troponin I: < 0.017 ng/dl. Echocardiogram: left ventricle not dilated, with preserved ejection fraction. Trivalve aortic valve, with good opening and slight central insufficiency. Left atrium not dilated. Mitral valve with good opening, diastolic mitral regurgitation. Aortic root not dilated. Right chambers not dilated, good right ventricular contractility. Mild tricuspid insufficiency. No pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography: left coronary trunk without lesions. Anterior descending: calcified aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal wall with slowing of distal flow. Circumflex: large aneurysmal dilatation at proximal level, calcified, with partial thrombosis of the lumen, which conditions flow slowing at distal level. Right coronary artery: no lesions. Aortography: no aneurysmal dilatation. Coronary CT: coronary saccular aneurysms in circumflex (partially thrombosed and with a 3-4 mm neck) and in the anterior descending artery (not thrombosed and seated on a 15 mm long dysplastic artery segment).   EVOLUTION A 56-year-old patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for 2:1 AV block with wide QRS and symptoms compatible with recent-onset exertional angina. Coronary angiography was performed, showing evidence of anterior descending artery with calcified aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal wall with slowing of distal flow, proximal circumflex artery with large aneurysmal dilatation, calcified, with partial thrombosis of the lumen, leading to slowing of distal flow. The case was discussed in a medical-surgical session and coronary surgery was decided upon, prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. The convenience of temporarily suspending treatment with peginterferon alfa in order to improve the leukocyte and platelet count figures as much as possible in preparation for surgery was discussed at the session. In this regard, he was assessed by Hepatology and they recommended suspending peginterferon prior to surgery and resuming it as soon as possible after the operation. On 21 October 2016, an EPS was performed, which revealed infra-Hisian AV block, and a definitive bicameral pacemaker was subsequently implanted without complications. Post-implantation controls of the pacemaker showed adequate functioning of the device. He was stable cardiovascular and asymptomatic, with no evidence of HF, and was discharged from hospital for admission the following week for cardiac surgery. On 4 November 2016, coronary revascularisation surgery with a double "Y" mammary artery under ECC was scheduled. Bypass of the left mammary artery to the anterior descending artery and of the right mammary artery to the obtuse marginal artery was performed. Distal and proximal ligation of the anterior descending aneurysm was also performed. Intervention without complications. Postoperative resuscitation without incident.  DIAGNOSIS Behçet's disease. Infra-Hisian atrioventricular 2:1 block. Implantation of a definitive bicameral pacemaker. Ischaemic heart disease due to coronary aneurysms. Coronary revascularisation with double mammary artery to anterior descending and obtuse marginal. Ligation of anterior descending aneurysm. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 72-year-old patient, operated on for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis with implantation of a biological aortic prosthesis (Mitroflow no21), who was admitted for febrile syndrome. The patient had a personal history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia, and was being treated with enalapril 10mg, one tablet every 12 hours, and simvastatin 40 mg, one tablet per day. Three months after the operation, the patient consulted the emergency department for two weeks of fever (> 38°C), asthenia, anorexia and deterioration of general condition. On physical examination he was haemodynamically stable (BP 140/80 mmHg; HR 75 bpm, SatO2 97 % breathing room air). Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed rhythmic, tachycardic sounds, with systolic murmur II/VI in the aortic focus, with no clinical signs of heart failure. The rest of the examination was unremarkable, with no cutaneous stigmata of endocarditis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS The admission blood test showed a high white blood cell count (16,000/μL) at the expense of neutrophils (87%) with elevated acute phase reactants (CRP 267 mg/l), the rest of the analytical parameters being normal. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and signs of left chamber enlargement with an overload pattern. On admission, 4 batches of serial blood cultures were taken and Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in all the bottles, so antibiotherapy with vancomycin, gentamicin and rifampicin was started, in accordance with the regimen recommended by the clinical practice guidelines. As a first approach, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed, which showed a biological prosthesis in the aortic position, with adequate opening of its leaflets, without the presence of periprosthetic regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed no evidence of prosthetic dysfunction or conclusive signs of endocarditis. Given the high clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis, it was decided to extend the study with positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET/CT), which showed increased FDG uptake at the level of the aortic root, periprosthetic, of annular morphology and with a SUVmax (Standard Uptake Value) of 5, compatible with endocarditis. It was decided to perform a new TEE, 2 weeks after the first study, where signs of endocarditis with significant periprosthetic involvement were observed: presence of periannular pseudoaneurysm with fistulisation towards the right atrium, vegetations and signs of periprosthetic dehiscence.  EVOLUTION After two weeks of antibiotic therapy with negative blood cultures, valve replacement surgery and repair of the aorto-atrial fistula with pericardial patch was performed. Microbiological analysis of the excised surgical tissue showed abundant polymorphonuclear cells without microorganisms in the Gram stain, and the culture was finally negative.  DIAGNOSIS Early infective endocarditis on aortic biological prosthesis due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Periprosthetic pseudoaneurysm, fistulised to right chambers. Antibiotic and surgical treatment with good evolution. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Male, 72 years old.  History Arterial hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, ex-smoker and dyslipidaemia as main cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiological history: implantation of a mechanical aortic prosthesis in 2005 due to severe aortic stenosis in bicuspid valve. Home treatment: lorazepam 1/day, acenocoumarol, torasemide 5 mg 1/day, telmisartan 80 mg 1/day, metformin 850 mg 1/12 h, omeprazole 20 mg 1/day. Previously well, the patient presented with absence of language and loss of strength and sensitivity in the entire right hemisphere. The SAMU was notified and activated the Stroke Code, arriving at the emergency department in a conventional ambulance with an estimated NIHSS of 16. In previous days she had referred mild catarrhal symptoms associated with a feeling of dystrophy.  Physical examination Neurological (NIHSS score): alert (0). Does not answer questions or obey orders (2+2). Gaze deviation to the left (1). Central facial paresis D (2). Paresis 4/5 in right upper limb (1). Paresis 2/5 in right lower limb (3). Not assessable sensitivity although to painful manoeuvre, slight withdrawal (1). Ataxia not assessable (0). Mutism (3+1). Not assessable extinction. BP 120/75 mmHg, Sat 99 % with nasal goggles at 3 bpm, HR 70. Temperature not recorded AC: RsCsRs without audible murmurs, prosthetic click. AP: mvc, no added sounds. Abdomen: soft, depressible. MMII without oedema or signs of DVT.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 66 bpm. Left anterior hemiblock. Chest X-ray: no condensation or signs of HF. Laboratory tests: biochemistry: Glc 187 mg/dl. Urea 45 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.95 mg/dl. Na 133 mmol/l. K 4.8 mmol/L. TnT 16 ng/l (normal < 35 ng/l). CPK 66 U/l (normal < 200 U/l). Haemogram: Hb 12.8 g/dl. Ht 34.9. Leukocytes 14,300/uL with 78 % neutrophils. Platelets 199.000/uL. Coagulation: PT 45 %; INR 1.86. Cranial CT: discrete hypodensity with loss of differentiation between grey matter and white matter at the level of the left frontal insula and operculum, compatible with acute ischaemic lesion (ASPECTS 8). No intra- or extra-axial haemorrhages are observed. Morphology of sulci and ventricles within normal limits for the patient's age. Discrete bilateral periventricular hypodensity compatible with chronic small vessel disease. Centred midline. Permeable base cisterns. Cerebral perfusion CT: in the superficial territory of the left MCA there is an increase in time to peak, mean transit time and drainage time, with a decrease in cerebral blood flow. At the level of the insula and the left frontal operculum there is a decrease in volume, compatible with established infarction, while in the rest of the superficial territory of the left MCA the volume is preserved, compatible with a penumbra area. Angio-CT of supra-aortic trunks and Willis polygon: repletion defect at the level of the distal M1 segment of the left MCA, with poor distal collateral circulation. No other repletion defects, aneurysmal formations or other alterations at the level of the intra- or extracranial circulation. Absence of both posterior communicating arteries. Carotid shafts slightly elongated. Patent vertebral arteries with right dominance. Basilar artery dependent exclusively on the right vertebral artery, with left vertebral artery leading directly into the PICA. Cerebral angiography: under sedation, cerebral arteriography was performed via the right femoral approach, without groin complications. Occlusion of the distal M1 segment of the left MCA was confirmed, with the existence of a proximal loop in the internal carotid artery. We proceeded to perform mechanical thrombectomy with an extractor device, achieving complete recanalisation of this artery, although with migration of two small emboli: one in the distal posterior parietal region (non-occlusive embolus) and the other in the sylvian region. Blood cultures: positive for Enterococcus faecalis. TTE and TEE: endocarditis on prosthetic aortic valve. Ascending aortic aneurysm of 49 mm. Mechanical aortic prosthesis with good disc mobility, maximum gradient of 35 mmHg, washout insufficiency. Two vibrational images compatible with vegetation visualised in LVOT are observed. Thickening of the aortic root and mitro-aortic junction suggestive of abscess at this level. MV with mild insufficiency. LV of normal dimensions with preserved systolic function. RV of normal dimensions with normal function. Moderate TR, with estimated PSAP of 30 mmHg plus PVC. Normal vena cava. No pericardial effusion.  EVOLUTION On arrival at the emergency department, on suspicion of acute stroke, the above-mentioned complementary tests were performed and cerebral angiography confirmed the presence of occlusion of the distal M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery. As a result, mechanical thrombectomy was performed, achieving complete recanalisation of the artery. The patient was then admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for neurological and haemodynamic monitoring and surveillance. The patient progressed satisfactorily in the ICU, where a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed with suspicion of endocarditis. Isolation of Enterococcus faecalis in blood cultures. A transesophageal study was performed with the results described. Once stable, in the light of the echocardiographic findings, discharge from the ICU to the Cardiology ward was decided in order to assess valve surgery. During his admission to Cardiology, he was assessed by the Rehabilitation Service and Neurology, who began motor and phoniatric recovery exercises. Cardiologically, he remained stable, with prolonged PR. Two days later, the patient had two episodes of sudden loss of consciousness, and telemetry showed complete atrioventricular block, so he was transferred to the Coronary Unit for implantation of a provisional pacemaker via the right jugular vein. The case was discussed with Cardiac Surgery who, given the electrical worsening and the need for a temporary pacemaker on command to maintain stability, decided to perform surgery within 48 hours. The patient underwent surgery two days later and a metallic valve prosthesis was extracted with abscess cleaning and a biological prosthesis was implanted in the aortic position, as well as a supracoronary tube due to the discovery of an aneurysm of the ascending aorta. Immediate and late postoperative evolution was favourable, except for the persistence of advanced AVB in ECG despite the absence of images compatible with abscesses in echocardiography, so it was decided to implant a definitive DDD pacemaker. Hospital discharge was decided in view of the good clinical evolution in the postoperative period 40 days after the neurological ischaemic event.  DIAGNOSIS Late prosthetic endocarditis due to Enterococcus faecalis. Ischaemic stroke due to thrombotic occlusion in left middle cerebral artery. Thrombectomy performed successfully. Complete atrioventricular block with definitive DDDR pacemaker implantation (MCP). Aortic valve replacement with Perimount biological aortic prosthesis no23. ʟʟ Ascending aortic aneurysm. Supracoronary tube implantation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sam is a 52-year-old male ex-smoker who denies any other cardiovascular risk factors. He has developed an unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil (T4bN2bM0) as a result of his past tobacco use. Currently undergoing radical treatment with cetuximab and radiotherapy. Asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view until the night of the day before the consultation, when he presented with central thoracic pain, oppressive and radiating to the back and neck, lasting a few hours. He denies having had fever or infectious symptoms. He consulted his primary care doctor who performed an electrocardiogram (ECG) in which they described an increase in the lower ST and high and low lateral ST, and was assessed by members of the Canary Islands Emergency Service (SUC) who informed the hospital of the diagnosis of inferolateral acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with a view to carrying out primary angioplasty. On arrival at the Emergency Department he was found to be hypotensive, so dopamine was started at a dose of 15 mcg/kg/min, and the Haemodynamics section was contacted for urgent catheterisation, so the cardiologist on duty went down to assess the patient. The ECG was repeated. Physical examination revealed a poor general condition, with significant tachypnoea and arterial hypotension of 85/55 mmHg despite catecholamines and mild jugular venous insufficiency. Cardiac sounds are very diminished with no murmurs or friction rub. There is an erythematous lump on the neck, warm and painful on palpation.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: no leukocytosis, normocytic normochromic anaemia of 9.7 mg/dL and acute renal failure with creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL. Hb: 13.3 g/dL, leukocytes 64,000, platelets 77x10^3/mcL. Echocardiography: global and segmental left ventricular function was preserved and severe pericardial effusion was detected with a maximum of 36 mm at the anterior level. Its appearance is dense, hyperechogenic and mottled. There were signs of haemodynamic compromise, with collapse of the left atrium and a slight collapse of the right ventricle. Other complementary tests during admission: ECG: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, normal PR, normal electrical axis, narrow QRS with generalised concave ST-elevation (I, II, III, aVF, V3-V6) Pericardial fluid culture and blood cultures: Streptococcus constellatum. Chest CT with contrast: bibasal lung consolidations. To evaluate possible bronchoaspiration. Minimal right pleural effusion. Pneumopericardium with drainage catheter inside. Multiple hepatic abscesses in LHI. LOE in LHI in relation to abscess versus metastatic disease (not present in previous study). Rest normal, no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy. Neck CT: favourable response of left tonsillar neoplasm and adenopathic conglomerates. Significant response with a decrease in the overall tumour volume of the neoplasm originating in the left lingual tonsil, with a residual necrotic lesion persisting at this level with a diameter of 24.8 + 30 mm, which protrudes towards the left lateral margin of the floor of the mouth.  EVOLUTION It was decided to perform an urgent therapeutic pericardiocentesis in the haemodynamics room. Initially, 600 cc of foul-smelling, purulent fluid was extracted. After analysing the emergency fluid, it was found to be purulent and S. constellatum, which was also isolated from blood, was isolated. An aetiological study was completed with a CT scan of the chest and abdomen to identify the possible origin of the purulent collection, finding multiple large liver abscesses, in whose culture different microorganisms grew, although they were also present in the oral microbiota: Gemella morbillorum and Parvimonas micra. In the first few days after drainage, the patient continued to require catecholaminergic support due to septic shock, so he was admitted to the ICU, where empirical intravenous antibiotic treatment was initially established, and subsequently adjusted to the antibiogram. Within a week of complete drainage of the fluid and despite optimal antibiotic treatment, the patient developed severe pericardial effusion again. Urgent pericardiocentesis and pericardial window were performed the following morning surgically by thoracoscopy.  DIAGNOSIS Purulent pericarditis complicated by pericardial tamponade. Polymicrobial septic shock with liver abscesses. T4N2bM0 tonsil carcinoma. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Background A 63-year-old patient with no known drug allergies, with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity) and a history of epilepsy, hypothyroidism secondary to thyroiditis and chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine levels of around 1.91. In December 2012, he presented with a first episode of congestive heart failure and was diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve with severe insufficiency and moderate LV dysfunction, and the medical-surgical committee decided to perform surgery. Preoperative coronary angiography ruled out significant coronary lesions. The operation was successfully performed on 08/04/2013 and a St Jude No. 25 mechanical prosthesis was placed. During the postoperative period, the patient had a torpid evolution with atrial flutter with a high ventricular response that was difficult to control, oliguric renal failure with an increase in creatinine levels to a maximum of 4 mg/dl, a generalised tonic-clonic seizure episode with a good pharmacological response to valproate and levetiracetam and retroperitoneal haematoma in the head and body of the pancreas. After progressive improvement with favourable evolution, the patient was discharged from hospital. Pre-discharge echocardiography: aortic prosthesis with normofunction criteria. LV slightly dilated (LVED 56 mm) and LVEF approximately 50%. Central mild MI. ECG prior to discharge: sinus rhythm with HRBBB at 60 bpm. Subsequently, correct follow-up by Cardiology outpatients without new cardiological events of interest and with normal echocardiographic controls. Regular treatment with synthrom, omeprazole 40 mg, ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/40 mg), fenofibrate 200 mg, eutirox 100 mcg, allopurinol 300 mg and levetiracetam 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Current history: on 5/01/2017 he attended the Emergency Department of our hospital due to initially diffuse and episodic abdominal pain that later became localised in the right hypochondrium for six hours, with no accompanying vegetative cortex. There was no thermometric fever, although there was a feeling of dystrophy. The patient also presented an increase in his usual dyspnoea to the point of minimal effort and orthopnoea. No syncope or presyncope. No palpitations or chest pain.  Physical examination BP 120/57, HR 63 bpm, Temperature: 37.7°C, Baseline O2 Sat 97% Patient conscious and temporospatially oriented, well perfused and hydrated. Colour slightly jaundiced, eupneic at rest. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without audible murmurs. Aortic valve click. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur in all fields without added pathological sounds. Abdomen globular but depressible, pain on palpation in the right hypochondrium. Murphy. Hydro-aerial sounds present. No signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower extremities without oedema or signs of DVT.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests on arrival at the ED: glucose 341, urea 84, creatinine 2.59, Na 131, Cl 101, K 4.8, liver profile and bilirubin without alterations. Myocardial necrosis markers: troponin I 0.06, myoglobin 97. ProBNP 3.984. Haemogram: Leukocytes 8,700 (75.4 % neutrophils), Hb 10.6, Hto 33.2 %, platelets 19,600. INR 3.33, prothrombin activity 25 %. ECG: complete AV block with escape rhythm at 56 bpm. BRDHH. No acute repolarisation abnormalities. Chest X-ray: (06/01/2017) atheromatosis and aortic elongation. Aortic prosthesis, cardiomegaly. Hilar thickening with vascular appearance. Ultrasound of the abdomen: (07/01/2017) distended gallbladder (125 x 44 mm) with thickening and parietal oedema (4 mm), perivesicular oedema, perivesicular-perihepatic free fluid and maximum pain at the gallbladder site. Inside, there are few small hyperechogenic images, one of them with posterior shadowing. Overall, the patient fulfils the criteria for acute cholecystitis as the first diagnostic possibility. It could be, although less likely, a stress gallbladder in the context of heart failure or alliasic cholecystitis (diabetic debut). Liver with a marked diffuse increase in steatotic echorefringence. No bile duct ectasia. Pancreatic area is not visible due to abundant abdominal weathering. Spleen of normal size and morphology. Kidneys of normal morphology and symmetrical. Abdominal aorta not approachable. Bladder without alterations.  EVOLUTION Given the ultrasound findings of acute cholecystitis, antibiotherapy was started as conservative management without improvement of the picture, persisting fever and worsening analytical control analysis: procalcitonin 6.84, creatinine 4.13, chlorine 108, sodium 135, potassium 5.4, amylase 95, lipase 258, normal liver profile, leucocytes 13.500 N87.3 %, Hb 9.5, haematocrit 30.7 %, INR 18.84, prothrombin activity 4 %. In view of this situation, it was decided to perform an urgent cholecystectomy. Prior to surgery, the Anaesthesia Service requested our assessment. Given the finding of complete AVB and fever, it was decided to perform echocardiography with the following result: Echocardiography: (09/01/2017) non-dilated LV (LVEDD 55 mm), preserved LVEF (estimated by Teicholz 65%). Septa with flattened motion. MV: slightly fibrous leaflets with calcium in the mitral annulus, mild central MI, no images suggestive of endocarditis on the mitral valve. St Jude mechanical aortic prosthesis no. 25, slightly elevated gradients for model and number of prosthesis (maximum gradient of 45 mmHg, mean gradient of 24 mmHg). At the level of the mitro-aortic junction, a filiform image of anarchic movement suggestive of an endocarditic process can be seen. At apical level 5C there is flow from VAo to LA suggestive of aorto-auricular fistula. Right chambers not dilated. Preserved RVEF (TAPSE 23 mmHg), mild TR. Non-dilated IVC with normal inspiratory collapse. PAPs 35 mmHg. No pericardial effusion, perihepatic free fluid. In view of the new evidence, blood cultures were taken and empirical antibiotic treatment was started with cloxacillin, ampicillin and gentamicin, adjusted according to renal function. He was admitted to the coronary ICU of our hospital pending transesophageal echocardiography and assessment by Cardiac Surgery. On admission to the ICU, he presented disconnection from the environment, right hemiplegia and complete aphasia. An urgent cranial CT scan was performed which showed an acute cerebral haematoma in the right parieto-temporal region measuring 29 x 25 x 32 mm with an estimated volume of 12 cc, subarachnoid discharge and minimal intraventricular blood. After acute haemorrhagic stroke, action by Cardiac Surgery was postponed. Subsequent poor evolution with persistent fever, septic symptoms and haemodynamic deterioration despite targeted antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures isolated Streptococcus gallolyticus sensitive to beta lactams. The patient died on 17/01/2017 after progressive worsening and multiorgan failure.   DIAGNOSIS Acute cholecystitis with torpid evolution, persistent fever and complete AV block. Streptococcus gallolyticus endocarditis on prosthetic AV complicated by aorto-cavitary fistula to the left atrium. Acute haemorrhagic stroke of possible cardioembolic origin Septic shock refractory to intensive medical treatment and multi-organ failure. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Blood cultures: positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, resistant to cloxacillin. Chest X-ray: possible consolidating focus in LID. Echocardiogram: normal LVEF and no contractile asymmetries. Normal diastole. LA not dilated. MV of fine veils, preserved kinetics, no MI. VAo trivalva, fine veils, normal flow. Dilated right chambers (RV inflow tract 50 mm and AD area 23 cm2), with preserved function. TV: thickening (11 mm) of the posterior and proximal subvalvular annulus as well as the entire posterior leaflet. At least two thick, echodense, anarchically moving masses, almost 2 cm long, originating in the atrial side of the posterior annulus and posterior leaflet, suggestive of endocardial involvement. Smaller mobile images can be seen on the other two leaflets. In addition, a rounded, echodense image on distal subvalvular, very mobile, which usually corresponds to fibrosis of the subvalvular, but endocardial involvement at that level cannot be ruled out given the clinical context. Severe TR without appreciating clear perforation of the leaflets. No apparent mobile images on the tip of the central catheter of the RA. PAPs 30-35 mmHg. Transesophageal echocardiogram: VT compatible with what was seen in TTE: thickening of the posterior and lateral region of the annulus as well as the leaflets, without observing abcessed formations. At least two thick, echodense, anarchically moving masses, about 16 mm long and 7 mm wide, originating in the atrial slope, at the junction of the posterior and lateral leaflets and annulus, compatible with endocarditic process. Severe tricuspid insufficiency with more echodense formation in distal subvalvular, possibly corresponding to fibrosis, without being able to rule out endocarditic formation at that level.  EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the Haematology Department for broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and transfusion of irradiated products (2 HC and 1 platelet pool in the Emergency Department). Given the suspicion of reservoir infection and possible endocarditis, a transthoracic echocardiogram was requested, where endocarditis was found at the level of the tricuspid valve, which was confirmed after TEE. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started, awaiting a clinical response and to assess options after 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy.  DIAGNOSIS Severe bone marrow aplasia with no response to immunosuppressive treatment. Endocarditis on tricuspid valve due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is an 89-year-old woman with the following history: CVRF: HBP. DM-2 (on treatment with ADO). Dyslipidaemia. Severe degenerative aortic stenosis under follow-up in outpatient cardiology consultations. Other: left ureteral lithiasis. Polyarthrosis.  Usual treatment: enalapril/HCTZ, vildagliptin, ASA, oral iron, pantoprazole, tamsulosin. In June 2014, he was admitted to another centre for heart failure. With a history of severe AS, it was decided to replace the aortic valve with a percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI), via the transfemoral route. The procedure was uneventful, with only one episode of paroxysmal AF with rapid ventricular response before implantation, which resolved spontaneously. Withdrawal of the transient PM 24 hours after implantation, remaining at all times in sinus rhythm and normal PR, with a previously known LBBB. On 06/09/14 she consulted her health centre for a sore throat and fever of up to 38.5 °C. Her GP diagnosed her with pharyngotonsillitis and started treatment with augmentin 875/125 mg vo/8h. The following day she consulted the emergency department of our centre because, in addition to the fever, she presented deviation of the corner of her mouth and dysarthria, and a non-contrast cranial CT scan was performed, the findings of which are described in the section on complementary tests. She was discharged with a diagnosis of transient ischaemic attack. Three days later, on 10/09/14, she returned to the emergency department because she continued to have fever at home. Although at the time of consultation she did not have a fever (36.5°C), a blood culture was taken and a chest X-ray was performed without conclusive findings. He was discharged with a diagnosis of non-condensing respiratory infection and levofloxacin 500 mg vo/12 h was added to the treatment he was already receiving with augmentin. Seven days later, on 17/09/14, he consulted the emergency department for the third time because the fever persisted. A new chest X-ray was performed, similar to the previous one, and the blood culture from the previous week was reviewed, which was "contaminated". Finally, it was decided to admit him to Internal Medicine to study the febrile syndrome.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG at discharge after TAVI (June 2014, another centre): sinus rhythm at 70 bpm. PR 130 ms. LBBB (already known). Cranial CT s/c (07/09/14, ER): severe ischaemic microangiopathy. Sequela of chronic ischaemic infarction of the left PCA territory. Chronic left lenticular lacunar lacunar infarction. Moderate corticosubcortical atrophy. Portable chest X-ray (10/09/14, ED): poor quality, rotated. No clear images of pneumonic condensation. Blood culture (10/09/14, ED): contaminated sample.  EVOLUTION On admission to Internal Medicine: auscultation described as "no audible murmurs, valve noise is heard". ECG: sinus rhythm and known LBBB. Augmentin + levofloxacin is maintained. We requested: culture and Gram of sputum and a TTE ordered due to the history of recent TAVI implantation. Nothing remarkable in the analysis except creatinine 1.45, which was attributed to pre-renal origin due to lack of water supply. In the TTE, the aortic prosthesis with maximum velocity 2.52 m/s, mean gradient 12 mmHg and jet of mild insufficiency. Preserved LVEF. Moderate TR. Severe PAH (PAPS 63 mmHg). Twenty-four hours after admission to the ward, the patient began to present "shivering" and high fever (39°C), and the control ECG showed the presence of AF with rapid ventricular response, so she was started on treatment with digoxin. The blood test showed for the first time a leukocytosis of 21,270 with left deviation (90% PMN). Serial analyses were requested with CRP which was found to be elevated (>100) and serial blood cultures.... The antibiotic treatment prescribed until then was changed to piperacillin-tazobactam iv adjusted to renal function. Forty-eight hours after admission, he presented with sudden signs of desaturation (SatO2 80%) which required oxygen therapy with VMK. Audible wheezing practically on entering the room. An urgent ECG was performed which showed the presence of a complete AVB with an escape HR (wide QRS) at 30 bpm, and the Cardiology ward was notified. Although the main suspicion in this patient was already established as complicated infective endocarditis, it was decided to implant an urgent transient pacemaker to stabilise the clinical situation. After implantation via the right subclavian vein, which passed without incident, the patient was transferred to the Cardiology Intermediate Care Unit of our department, and antibiotic treatment was associated with daptomycin 600 mg iv/24 h and the digoxin she was taking was withdrawn (digoxinaemia was then 2 ng/mL). A new TTE + TEE was also requested due to the very high suspicion of infective endocarditis. On 23/09/14, the results of the serial blood cultures from the Internal Medicine ward came back: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (+) in 3 of 4 samples. TTE + TEE was performed with the following findings/summary: DTDVI 32 mm. Basal septal hypertrophy of 20 mm. Normal EF. Rest of cavities normal. Severe extensive calcification of the mitral annulus with normal distal leaflet mobility and no regurgitation. TAVI with periprosthetic eccentric regurgitation with peak gradient of 50 mmHg and mean of 30 mmHg. There is mobile vegetation that appears to be inserted below the tricuspid septal leaflet and some aortic periannular thickening adjacent to the tricuspid valve in the right anterior region of the same, compatible with periannular abscess-pseudoaneurysm, with microperforation towards the RA. Mild TR with a gradient of 46 mm and PAPS of 50 mmHg. In TEE: TAVI with thin prosthetic veils and area by planimetry around 1 cm2. Small prosthetic ring (18 mm). Filiform vegetation is observed in the right coronary leaflet. Periprosthetic regurgitation in the anterior region of the ring, which appears to be small. In the following days, the BAV resolved completely, becoming first-degree BAV (PR 200 ms). Antibiotic treatment with daptomycin was continued. After discussing the patient in a medical-surgical session, valve intervention was ruled out due to the patient's age and high morbidity and mortality. After confirming that blood cultures were negative, it was decided to implant a definitive MP, the scheduled date of which had to be postponed several times due to recurrence of fever, development of local infection of the transient MP (inflammatory signs in the venipuncture area), nosocomial pneumonia and significant bicytopenia (Hb 8.5 and platelets 45,000, the origin of which was not completely clarified and which led to a reduction in the doses of daptomycin). The day before rescheduling for definitive MP implantation, the patient suffered a sudden disconnection from the environment and a deterioration in her level of consciousness. An urgent cranial CT scan was performed, showing ischaemic embolic stroke (septic embolism as the first possibility) of the left middle cerebral artery. Under these conditions, it was decided to limit therapeutic effort, withdraw the transitional MP and transfer him to the Palliative Care Unit, where he continued with fever and was discharged on 10/10/14.  DIAGNOSIS Late (> 2 months) infective prosthetic endocarditis on percutaneously implanted biological aortic prosthesis (TAVI) due to S. epidermidis MR, complicated by: Periannular abscess/pseudoaneurysm with microperforation into the right atrium; development of symptomatic complete atrioventricular block requiring urgent pacing with transient pacemaker, initially resolved; embolic ischaemic stroke (septic embolism) of the middle cerebral artery; progressive deterioration of the level of consciousness and exitus in the context of the previous point. Possible nosocomial pneumonia of unclear aetiology. Local infection of the transient pacemaker (venipuncture area), without having been able to rule out associated endocarditis on the ventricular electrode. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Male, 49 years old. Secondary school teacher in a public secondary school Stress at work, regular exercise (spinning and racket sports) Non-smoker Dyslipidaemia under dietary treatment No other relevant history He was attended by transport and advanced life support personnel (mobile ICU) for having presented dizziness followed by chest pain with oppressive characteristics, which started after finishing a moderate exercise session (paddle tennis class in a sports centre).  Medical staff observed a minimal rise in the ST segment of the non-specific electrocardiogram (ECG), and he was transferred to his referral centre. Blood pressure 120/85 mmHg. 65 bpm. Height 184 cm, weight 108 kg. BMI: 31.9 kg/m2. BP 125 cm. Pulse oximetry saturation of 96% with room air. Eupneic, no carotid murmurs, pulmonary ventilation is normal, heart sounds are rhythmic, 68 bpm, 4th apical sound, no murmurs are auscultated. Pulses are permeable and symmetrical in all 4 extremities. No oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Initial ECG in the ED: precordial pain, no significant alterations. The rhythm is sinus at 65 bpm and no areas of ischaemia or necrosis are observed. No hypertrophy, ST segment or T wave alterations. Myocardial damage markers were determined, with typical enzyme curve, peak CPK-MB of 98 U/L and ultrasensitive troponin T of 215 ng/L. He presented with an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the acute phase lasting a few minutes and spontaneous remission. He was admitted to the intensive care unit. Doppler echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle, with abundant trabeculae and sinusoids in apical and lateral segments and preserved global systolic function. Slight lateroapical hypokinesia. Study suggestive of non-compacted left ventricle. LVEF 54%. More than three trabeculae, protruding from the left ventricular wall, apical to the papillary muscles. Intertrabecular spaces perfused from the ventricular cavity (with colour Doppler). Ratio >2 between uncompacted layer and compacted layer in the segment with greater hypertrabeculation in end-systole. Cardioresonance: inferolateral and mid and apical lateral akinesia. Increased trabeculation in lateral and medial segments and apical segments, with suspicion of non-compacted myocardium. The distance between the epicardial surface to the lowest part of the trabeculae and the distance from the epicardial surface to the peak of the trabeculae is ≤0.5. Diagnostic coronary angiography and coronary intervention: 1-vessel disease: circumflex-2a obtuse marginal. Balloon PCI and implantation of 2 drug-eluting stents was performed. A neuromuscular examination was performed, which was normal, and the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) enzyme elevation decreased gradually until it normalised. 48 hours later, he was admitted to the cardiology ward for treatment with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24h, clopidrogel 75 mg/24h, rosuvastatin 20 mg/d, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/d. Once on the ward, new laboratory tests were performed: Biochemistry: glycaemia 297 mg/dl, total cholesterol 208 mg/dl, HDL 36 mg/dl, LDL 129 mg/dl, triglycerides 215 mg/dl, urea 67 mg/L, creatinine 1.2 mg/dl, creatinine clearance 64 ml/min/1.73 m2. Basal fasting blood glucose and HbA1C were determined, which showed a value of 8.5%, and the patient was diagnosed with type II DM.  EVOLUTION After an adequate clinical evolution, he was discharged from hospital on the 5th day of the acute event, being referred to the cardiac rehabilitation unit within 2 weeks. A welcome interview is carried out and informed consent is requested, and the patient signs the document. It is necessary to stratify the risk of cardiovascular events in the short and medium term. For this purpose, a functional assessment was carried out by means of ergometry prior to inclusion in the programme, in this case the Bruce protocol, exercise time on a treadmill of 6 minutes, work of 7 METs, limited by muscular exhaustion. Maximum HR: 120 l/m, reached 70% of maximum heart rate at age, clinical and electrical negative, basal BP 120/80 mmHg, at maximum effort 160/70. Normal recovery, no arrhythmias.  DIAGNOSIS NSTEACS: Small non-q AMI.

Background 42-year-old woman with no known drug allergies. No hypertension, dyslipidaemia or diabetes mellitus. No toxic habits. Inactive ulcerative colitis under treatment. Periodic follow-up by digestology. Last colonoscopy in 2013. Migraine in treatment with triptans.  Current illness Puerpera patient with an uneventful pregnancy who, after the 4th day of euthocic delivery, began to feel dyspnoea with slight precordial pressure and headache, not associated with vegetatism. Elevated blood pressure and proteinuria were observed, and a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia was made. Creatinine levels were normal. A fundus examination was performed and found to be normal. After starting treatment with labetalol and magnesium sulphate, the patient progressed favourably, with control of blood pressure and improvement in headache and general condition. Laboratory tests showed an initial increase in LDH with a subsequent decrease. Labetalol ev and magnesium sulphate were maintained until 48 hours had elapsed, and the patient was subsequently switched to oral labetalol (300 mg/6h). Given the clinical and analytical stability, the patient was transferred to the hospital ward. During her stay in the hospital ward, the patient remained hypertensive despite nifedipine 10 mg/6h vo and enalapril 5 mg/12h vo. Recurrence of severe headaches without neurological focality, so a cranial CAT scan was performed, which was normal. Given the persistence of the headache and his history of migraine, sumatriptan was started with clinical improvement. After 48 hours of her stay on the ward, she presented peak blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg together with chest tightness. An ECG was performed, showing RS at 60 bpm, with normal PR, HBASHH, ST elevation of 0.5 mm anterolateral with negative T. Nitroglycerin perfusion was started and the patient was asymptomatic after 15 minutes. She was transferred to our centre from the maternity hospital. On arrival, no chest pain. BP 160/90 mmHg. HR 65 bpm. SaO2 100% (ambient air). No semiology of congestion.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: shows normalisation of ST, although HBASHH persists and minimal R in precordial leads. Initial TnI 0.7 ng/ml. Laboratory tests: CRP 0.95 mg/dl; creatinine 0.44 mg/dl; Na 141 mmol/L; K 3.8 mmol/l; leukocytes 6,800/mcl; Hb 130 g/l; Hto 40 %; Plaq 298,000/mcl; PT 86.2 %; D-dimer 10,000 ng/ml. A portable echocardiogram was performed, showing preserved LV systolic function, with hypokinesia of the apical segments and slight pericardial effusion. Chest X-ray: no cardiomegaly. No signs of parenchymal congestion. Free costophrenic sinuses.  EVOLUTION Admitted to the Acute Cardiac Care Unit, presenting haemodynamic stability with a tendency to hypertension. No new episodes of chest pain or signs of congestion. Peak Tn I 24 ng/ml. Normal renal function. Twenty-four hours after arrival, coronary angiography showed coronary dissection of the distal LAD with apical recurrence (TIMI 3 flow) and conservative management was chosen. The echocardiogram showed non-dilated left ventricle with EF 50%. Septoapical hypokinesia and mild mitral insufficiency. Normal RV function. Anti-aggregation treatment was maintained with adiro 100 mg indefinitely and anticoagulant treatment was discontinued after 72 hours. Due to a tendency to hypertension, treatment was started with ACE inhibitors, amlodipine and beta-blockers. She was discharged home asymptomatic and with controlled blood pressure.  DIAGNOSIS Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the LAD in a postpartum patient. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A 47-year-old man was brought to our centre by the emergency services after presenting a recovered cardiorespiratory arrest.  History Cardiovascular risk factors: type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoker of 1 pack/day. Gout episode in 2010 treated with colchicine and allopurinol. he underwent bilateral inguinal hernioplasty. ʟʟ No known previous cardiovascular history or family history of early ischaemic heart disease.  Usual treatment: losartan 50 mg, metformin 850 mg (half a tablet per day).  Present illness: he was brought to our centre by the emergency services after presenting with witnessed cardiorespiratory arrest in the street, and basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) manoeuvres were started by a technician for 15 minutes. After the arrival of the emergency services, advanced CPR and orotracheal intubation (OTI) were started. A defibrillable rhythm was identified on the monitor and two shocks were applied at maximum energy, after which sinus rhythm was restored and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an ST-segment elevation in the lower face. On arrival at our centre, the ECG was repeated, showing normalisation of the ST segment in the inferior face. A portable transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, showing akinesia of the inferior face. The patient was transferred urgently to the haemodynamics room and a therapeutic hypothermia protocol was initiated. Coronary angiography was performed, showing occlusion of the ostial circumflex artery (CX), which receives heterocoronary collateral circulation from the anterior descending artery (AD), and severe stenosis in the middle segment of the right coronary artery (RCA) with an image of complex plaque. In view of the electrocardiographic and TTE findings, the CD artery was considered to be responsible for the condition, so angioplasty and implantation of 2 coated stents was performed with suboptimal results due to poor stent apposition due to the significant calcium load and irregular distribution of calcium. Subsequently, he was transferred to the Acute Cardiac Care Unit intubated, sedoanalgesiated and relaxed, and cooled with physiological saline solution at 4oC.  Physical examination Blood pressure: 108/60. Heart rate: 65 bpm. oxygen saturation: 100%. Head and neck: jugular venous pressure normal. Pulmonary auscultation: decreased vesicular murmur in the right hemithorax. Cardiac auscultation: no murmurs or extratonos. Abdomen: hydro-aerial sounds present. Soft, without masses or organomegaly. Extremities: pulses of slightly decreased amplitude, symmetrical, no oedema in the lower limbs, slow capillary filling. Neurological: reactive symmetrical pupils. Ramsay 6.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG (after defibrillation): sinus rhythm, narrow QRS, ST-segment elevation of up to 4 mm in inferior face, greater in lead III than in II, with specular decrease from V1 to V3. ECG (on arrival at our centre): normalisation of ST-segment elevation in the inferior face.  Analysis on admission: Hb 14 g/dL, leukocytes 17300/μL (neutrophils 85%), platelets 270000/μL, INR 1, D-dimer 15346 ng/mL, glucose 346 mg/dL, urea 27 mg/dL, creatinine 0.83 mg/dL, Na 134 mg/dL, potassium 4.3 mg/dL, NTproBNP 280 pg/mL, ALT 48 U/L, GGT 32U/L, alkaline phosphatase 76U/L, amylase and lipase normal, Mg 2.3 mg/dL, Ca 8.1 mg/dL, P 6.4 mg/dL, total cholesterol 138 mg/dL, LDL 84 mg/dL, HDL 35 mg/dL, triglycerides 92 mg/dL, HbA1c 6.2%, TSH 0.03 ulU/mL, free T4 17.6 pg/mL, free T3 3.9 pg/mL. Myocardial necrosis markers: peak troponin I 149 ng/mL, peak CK 2512 U/L. Neuron specific enolase: 1st determination: 29.4 ng/mL. Second determination: 43.3 ng/mL.  Blood cultures, urine culture and bronchial aspirate culture: negative. Chest X-ray on admission: atelectasis in the right upper lobe.  Chest X-ray 2 days after admission: alveolointerstitial infiltrate in right lung and left lung base. Resolution of right upper lobe atelectasis.  Portable echocardiogram on admission (during induction of hypothermia): moderate-severe left ventricular dysfunction with estimated LVEF 35%, with posterior and inferior akinesia and lateral hypokinesia. Right ventricle with slightly reduced systolic function (TAPSE 15 mm), mild mitral insufficiency, no pericardial effusion.  Echocardiogram after termination of hypothermia and extubation: mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function (LVEF by biplane 57%). Apical akinesia and hypokinesia of the inferior and septal aspect. Mild mitral insufficiency. Urgent coronary angiography: left main coronary artery: no stenosis. DA artery: vessel of adequate calibre and development, without stenosis. Artery CX: vessel of adequate size and development, with 100% ostial occlusion that receives homocoronary Rentrop-3 collateral circulation from the diagonal branches of the DA artery. CD artery: severely calcified dominant vessel, of adequate size and development, with 75% stenosis in its proximal segment and 90% ulcerated plaque image in its middle segment. Balloon angioplasty and implantation of 2 overlapping drug-eluting stents in the middle and proximal segments of the CD artery, with TIMI III distal flow.  EVOLUTION On arrival at the Acute Cardiac Care Unit, a femoral venous hypothermia catheter (Coolgard®) was inserted and cooling was completed, reaching a target temperature of 33°C within a few hours. The admission X-ray showed an image of atelectasis in the right upper lobe, probably related to secretion impaction, which resolved in the subsequent control X-ray after aspiration of the endotracheal tube and mobilisation of the patient. Therapeutic hypothermia was maintained for 24 hours, and subsequent rewarming was carried out without complications. The patient evolved well, allowing him to be extubated on the third day of admission. After rewarming and extubation, the patient made a good neurological recovery, with adequate mobilisation of all four limbs, and was oriented, able to understand and obey orders, with some frontal deficit, which gradually recovered. On discharge he persisted with mild dysarthria, pending assessment and follow-up by rehabilitation and speech therapy. Incidentally, during his admission he presented a bout of atrial fibrillation on telemetry, which cardioverted to sinus rhythm after starting amiodarone, with no new arrhythmic episodes. On arrival at the hospital, the emergency services informed us of the possibility of bronchoaspiration during OTI, so blood, urine and bronchial aspirate cultures were taken on admission, and empirical antibiotic coverage with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was started. The cultures, however, were negative. After completing rewarming, fever was observed for more than 24 hours, with purulent secretions in the ventilation tube, so antibiotic therapy was modified and meropenem and metronidazole were started, with good evolution, with no new febrile peaks. The patient was discharged with treatment with adiro 100 mg, prasugrel 10 mg, pantoprazole 20 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, enalapril 10 mg and metoprolol 50 mg at breakfast and 25 mg at dinner. The patient was referred to the cardiac rehabilitation department of our centre.  DIAGNOSIS Cardio-respiratory arrest due to recovered ventricular fibrillation. Killip I inferior STEACS. Angioplasty and implantation of drug-eluting stents in the proximal and middle right coronary artery. Total occlusion of ostial circumflex artery with collateral circulation. Therapeutic hypothermia. Bronchoaspiration pneumonia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 53-year-old male. No known drug allergies.  Family history Mother died suddenly at the age of 72. Maternal uncle died in the operating theatre during anaesthetic induction.  Cardiovascular risk factors Smoker of about 30 pack-years Non-drinker No hypertension, DM or LD No known cardiac history Other: reactive depression Treatments: omeprazole and deprax  Current illness 53-year-old patient who consults for syncope. First syncope 18 months ago, when she consulted this centre, but requested voluntary discharge before the aetiology could be studied. Repeated another 6 times, with prodromes - loss of consciousness - rapid recovery. One of them at rest.  Physical examination COC. Afebrile. A: 100/60. HR: 55 bpm. BEG. NHNC. Normal PC. Arterial pulse bisferiens. Cardiac auscultation: RsCsRs with systolic murmur III/VI with preserved s2 in aortic focus irradiated to the rest of foci. Decrease in murmur until it disappeared with squatting. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Soft, non-painful abdomen with no masses or megaliths. Positive radial and pedial arterial pulses, bilateral and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood count, biochemistry and coagulation: no alterations. Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index normal, without condensation or signs of heart failure. ECG: sinus rhythm with LV enlargement and signs of overload. Transthoracic echocardiogram: LA moderately dilated (33 cm2 and 4.5 cm). LV with severe hypertrophy of septal predominance (23 mm), not dilated, with preserved systolic function. Mitral SAM. LVOT obstruction with maximum gradient 111 mmHg, baseline. Severe eccentric MI. Telemetry during hospitalisation: no rhythm alterations.  EVOLUTION Patient admitted to Cardiology for syncope under study. Auscultation revealed a murmur that decreased with manoeuvres that increased ventricular volume (increased afterload with squatting) and an ECG with criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy and a bisferiens arterial pulse, for which he was admitted with the suspicion of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This suspicion was confirmed by echocardiography, which revealed atrial dilatation and obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. The patient was monitored with telemetry from admission, and no arrhythmic events were observed. In accordance with the new guidelines on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the risk of sudden death at 5 years is calculated, with a result of more than 6%, and therefore the implantation of a defibrillator is recommended. Consent was obtained both for ICD implantation and for blood extraction for genetic study, and the family study of the index case was initiated.

HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Objective: the interpretation of the ECG and the clinical context is key to diagnosis and subsequent treatment. A 31-year-old primigravid 33-week-old woman was transferred to the Cardiology Department of the Hospital Central de Asturias due to dizziness, palpitations and electrocardiographic alterations. AP: Allergy to diclofenac and naproxen. She works in a supermarket. Cardiovascular risk factors No toxic habits. No hypertension, mixed dyslipidaemia (currently discharged by endocrinologist, treated with simvastatin and fenofibrate, no follow-up). Gestational diabetes treated with insulin Lispro 25/75: 12 units in the morning, 10 units at night. No previous cardiological history. Hepatic steatosis. Herniated disc. Breast reduction surgery.  Present illness The patient attended her referral hospital due to dizziness of 24 hours of evolution in relation to standing upright. The symptoms improve with decubitus. No chest pain or dyspnoea. Occasional episodes of palpitations. The patient reported catarrhal symptoms a few days earlier. ECG was performed and described as wide QRS tachycardia at 180 bpm. Vagal manoeuvres were performed but were ineffective and 6 and 12 mg of adenosine were prescribed with no response, so he was referred to our centre. We do not have the patient's baseline ECG. On arrival at our centre, the patient was asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable.  Physical examination BP: 110/75 mmHg. HR: 188 bpm. O2 Sat: 98% without oxygen therapy. Conscious, oriented, cooperative. Normohydrated and normal colour. AP: preserved vesicular murmur with no other superimposed noises. AC: rhythmic heart sounds with mitral SS III/IV with normal S2. Abdomen: 33 weeks pregnant. Scar on the breasts. MMII: no oedema, no signs of DVT.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood count: Hb 12.5g/dl, MCV 82.6 fL, leukocytes12500 uL (normal formula), platelets 239000 uL. Biochemistry: glucose 125mg/dl, urea 17 mg/dl, creatinine 0.61 mg/dl, sodium 135 mg/dl, CK 56 U/L, troponin T 33 ng/L. Coagulation: PT 87%, INR 1.09, fibrinogen 686, D-dimer 1187 ng/ml. ECG transthoracic echocardiography: study performed at 160 bpm. Non-dilated LV, non-hypertrophic, hypercontractile, without alterations of regional contractility. Preserved LVEF, no dilatation of the right chambers. Moderate mitral insufficiency.  EVOLUTION Admission to the Advanced Cardiac Care Unit for monitoring and treatment. Vagal manoeuvres and adenosine 6 and 12 mg were repeated, both without success. IV atenolol 4mg was prescribed, with no response, so electrical cardioversion (ECV) was decided. The case was discussed with the Gynaecology and Anaesthesiology departments and two ECV (100 and 200J) were performed under maternal sedation with propofol and foetal monitoring, both of which were unsuccessful. No foetal distress was observed at any time. The patient remained asymptomatic at all times and haemodynamically stable. Monitoring showed persistent wide QRS tachycardia (same morphology as on the arrival ECG) at similar frequencies (170-190 bpm). Given the persistence of the arrhythmia, it was decided to start treatment with an infusion of beta-blockers (labetalol at 20 ml/h) and an ampoule of 0.5 mg of intravenous digoxin. The tachycardia rate was initially reduced to around 150 bpm, with progressively more frequent presence of sinus beats interspersed with the arrhythmia, followed by trigeminy (visualisation on telemetry recording). A few hours later, sinus rhythm was observed, with isolated ventricular extrasystoles persisting. At 12 hours after the start of perfusion, after several hours in stable sinus rhythm, beta-blocker perfusion was discontinued and the patient's ECG was as shown in figure 2. The patient reported only symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux, for which oral ranitindin was prescribed if necessary. After a further 8 hours of monitoring with persistent sinus rhythm, she was transferred to the Cardiology ward and the TTE was repeated. The patient remained hospitalised for a further 48 hours and after finding that there were no gynaecological complications and that she remained asymptomatic with an ECG recording in sinus rhythm without alterations, discharge was decided with prophylactic treatment with metropolol pending outpatient consultation with the Arrhythmia section of our centre. After assessment by gynaecology, no complications related to pregnancy were detected, so outpatient follow-up was decided as planned.  DIAGNOSIS This must be resolved by the contestant through the interpretation of the ECG. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Male, 36 years old.  History AHT Stage III chronic renal failure secondary to vesicoureteral reflux Current illness The patient reported fever and vomiting for 3 days, general malaise, generalised aches and pains, dystrophic sensation, chills, sweating and vomiting.  Physical examination BP: 100/40 Ta: 39.5 °C Normal colour, hydrated and perfused Eupneic at 0° Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic with systolic murmur in EIB Pulmonary auscultation: VCM Abdomen: no evidence of peritoneal irritation  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: RS, BCRIHH. Chest X-ray: normal. Laboratory tests: biochemistry: creatinine 7.99 mg/gl; Na 131 mEq/l; K 4.59 mEq/l, CRP 23.09 mg/dl. Gases: pH 7.23, pCO2 36 mmHg, pO2 14 mmHg, HCO3 15 mmol/l, Ebb - 11.6 mmol/l. Haemogram: Hb 11.6 g/dl, platelets 80 x1000/ul, leucocytes 16.30x1000/ ul, neutrophils 94.7%. Coagulation: prothrombin activity 65%, INR 1.34 Abdominal CT scan with chest sections: abdomen normal. Chest sections included in the study showed a 1 cm nodule in LID, two in LII (the largest measuring 5 mm) and another in the anterior part of the lingula, all undetermined, with an infectious aetiology to be assessed. Blood cultures: methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Transthoracic echocardiogram: image compatible with endocardial wart of 15x10 mm anchored to the IV septum. Restrictive ventricular septal defect. Transesophageal echocardiogram recommended. Transesophageal echocardiogram: rules out involvement of other valves.  EVOLUTION In view of the febrile syndrome presented by the patient, two sets of blood cultures were requested. A possible abdominal focus was suspected on the basis of the clinical manifestations and an abdominal CT scan was performed, which ruled it out, although possible infectious foci in the lungs were evident. Two sets of blood cultures were taken and were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. After isolation of S. aureus in both sets and the presence of previously unknown left bundle branch block and murmur, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing an endocardial wart dependent on the tricuspid subvalvular apparatus or the interventricular septum; and a restrictive ventricular septal defect (GP max 140 mmHg). Antibiotic therapy with intravenous cloxacillin was started, after which the patient remained afebrile, asymptomatic, with a decrease in acute phase reactants and sterile serial blood cultures. A control transthoracic echocardiogram was performed 7 days after starting antibiotic therapy and it was found that the wart image had not decreased in size. A wait-and-see attitude was maintained and 14 days after starting antibiotic treatment, a new echocardiographic check-up was performed, which showed no changes with respect to the diagnostic echocardiogram. Given the persistence of the vegetation, surgical intervention was indicated in conjunction with the Cardiac Surgery Service. The possibilities were explained to the patient and he accepted. The vegetation was resected and the VSD was closed with direct suture. The patient evolved favourably and was included in the haemodialysis programme.  DIAGNOSIS Tricuspid endocarditis due to S. aureus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 56-year-old male, no known allergies, with a history of arterial hypertension, moderate obesity, paroxysmal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with sintrom and gout. He was a bus driver by profession. He came to the emergency department with a single episode of oppressive central chest pain that woke him up in the early hours of the morning, of approximately one hour's duration, non-radiating and without associated vegetative cortex, with no other concomitant symptoms (dyspnoea, palpitations, syncope, etc.). The chest pain subsided during her stay in the emergency department after starting intravenous solinitrin infusion and controlling her blood pressure. On arrival, he was in good general condition. Blood pressure was 200/121 mmHg, heart rate 83 beats per minute and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Cardiopulmonary auscultation and the rest of the physical examination were normal. A patient with an episode of chest pain at rest and troponin elevation in the context of very high blood pressure was admitted to Cardiology with the initial diagnosis of hypertensive emergency.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on admission: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Narrow QRS. Q in III and VF with ST elevation of less than 1mm. V3-V6 and negative T in aVL. Poor progression of R in precordial leads. No changes in serial ECG, all without pain. Laboratory tests in the emergency department: haemogram, biochemistry and coagulation normal. Myocardial necrosis markers slightly elevated (maximum US TnT 16 ng/ml being the limit 14, without typical curve of acute coronary syndrome). Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. Aortic elongation. Hilar thickening. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle with moderate concentric hypertrophy (14-14 mm), without alterations of segmental contractility. Dilatation of the ascending aorta. Stress cardiac MRI with dipyridamole: hypertensive heart disease with normal LVEF. Absence of inducible ischaemia or myocardial necrosis. Image of slight thickening of the thoracic aorta at the ascending and descending levels compatible with intramural haematoma. Angio-CT scan: intramural haematoma affecting the aortic arch and extending to the descending thoracic aorta without reaching the abdominal aorta. No images of penetrating ulcer or signs of dissection were identified. No aneurysmal dilatations were observed. The rest of the aorta had no significant findings. Central laboratory: urea 38 mg/dl, creatinine 0.88 mg/dl, uric acid 10.6 mg/dl. uric acid 10.6 mg/dl, sodium 139 mmol/l, potassium 4.4 mmol/l, chlorine 102 mmol/l, cholesterol 273 mg/dl, triglycerides 341 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 44 mg/dl, direct LDL cholesterol 190 mg/dl, leucocytes 9100 /mm3, haemoglobin 13.6 g/dl, OHT 41%, platelets 250000/mm3, INR 1.08, HbA1c 7%, TSH 0.7 μU/ml.  EVOLUTION During his stay in the cardiology ward, the patient remained clinically stable and asymptomatic, without new episodes of chest pain, with good control of blood pressure under treatment with beta-blockers, oral nitrates and ACE inhibitors. After performing a transthoracic echocardiogram on the first day of hospital admission, and finding dilatation of the ascending aorta, a stress MRI with dipyridamole was requested to evaluate the aorta and rule out both acute aortic syndrome and ischaemic heart disease. Following the diagnosis of intramural haematoma with the imaging tests, successive angio-CT scans were performed to assess the evolution, given that the patient remained clinically stable. Given the absence of haematoma growth on imaging tests and as the ascending aorta was not compromised, expectant management was decided, with discharge from hospital and preferential follow-up in the Cardiovascular Surgery outpatient department. Twenty-five days after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department with a new episode of sudden and intense pain in the lumbar region accompanied by paraesthesia in the right lower limb. Examination revealed an absence of femoral pulses bilaterally. An emergency angio-CT scan was performed, revealing a type A dissection with extension from the ascending aorta to both iliac arteries, as well as thrombosis of the false lumen in the ascending aorta, highlighting the significant increase in the diameter of the ascending aorta compared to the previous study. In view of these findings, urgent surgery was decided. During the surgical procedure, it was not possible to detect the entrance door at the level of the ascending aorta or the arch, so a diagnosis of a type B dissection with retrograde progression was finally made, and the ascending aorta was replaced with a 32 mm Dacron graft. Subsequently, the patient had a torpid evolution during his stay in the ICU, requiring vasoactive drugs and daily haemofiltration in the immediate postoperative period. After clinical stabilisation, the patient was extubated and discharged from the intensive care unit. During his stay in the ward, the patient evolved adequately without new complications and was discharged and referred to outpatients for follow-up with an intensive rehabilitation programme. Currently, 3 months after admission for hypertensive emergency, the patient is clinically stable.   DIAGNOSIS The cardiac MRI, which was negative for ischaemia, showed an image compatible with intramural haematoma in the thoracic aorta, without affecting the ascending aorta, so CT angiography was requested and confirmed the findings previously described. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history No known drug allergies. No DM, DLP or AHT. Active smoker. Chronic gastritis. Surgical interventions: bilateral breast prosthesis. Family history: mother died suddenly at the age of 48 and sister died at the age of 50 (AMI?). Second-degree relatives with Chagas disease. usual treatment: pantoprazole.  Current disease The patient was a 45-year-old woman from Brazil who presented with two episodes of oppressive central thoracic pain radiating towards the MSI, the first of which was self-limiting and lasted 5-10 minutes and the second persistent over time, accompanied by a sensation of dizziness, for which she went to the emergency department of a regional hospital. The patient reported self-limited palpitations the previous night, for which reason she did not consult the emergency department. In view of these symptoms, an electrocardiogram was performed showing a regular tachycardia with a wide QRS at 230 bpm which subsided after administration of flecainide 200 mg by mouth and went into sinus rhythm 20 minutes after treatment, with a 1st degree BAV and an ST descent of up to 2 mm with a horizontal slope in V4-V6. Examination revealed: poor general condition with tachypnoea and tachycardia, with a large component of anxiety. Blood pressure 113/77 mmHg. O2 Sat 100%. Cardiopulmonary auscultation without findings, except tachycardia. No oedema in the lower limbs. During her stay in the ED, she remained asymptomatic with no new episodes of tachycardia, normalisation of the ST segment and a slight increase in TnI (0.019 to 0.14) with normal CPK. He was admitted to the ICU of a regional hospital for monitoring and treatment. During her stay in the ICU, the patient remained asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable, with no new episodes of tachycardia, no changes in the electrocardiogram, no clinical signs of heart failure and normalisation of TnI. An echocardiogram was performed with an LVEF of 55% with no alterations in contractility and mild mitral insufficiency. From there, the case was discussed with the Arrhythmia Unit and an electrophysiological study was requested in which, after isoproterenol perfusion, regular tachycardia with wide QRS was induced, compatible with ventricular tachycardia of basal and upper left ventricular origin. In view of SMVT in a patient with a family history of sudden death, it was decided to admit him to our hospital ward to complete the study and assess treatment (pharmacological vs. ablation). Treatment was started with beta-blockers.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG (regional hospital emergency department): regular tachycardia with wide QRS (180 ms) with morphology of complete right bundle branch block (positive V1) and lower frontal plane axis, concordant in precodials and atrioventricular dissociation compatible with ventricular tachycardia of basal anterolateral origin of the left ventricle. ECG (after TVMS): sinus rhythm at 65 bpm, PR 220 ms (BAV 1st degree), normal axis (0o), narrow QRS, ST descent 2 mm maximum in V4-V6 with negative T in II, III and aVF. CBC (ED regional hospital): glucose 188 mg/dl, urea 26 mg/dl, creatinine 0.88 mg/dl, Na 140 mEq/l, K 4.2 mEq/l, Ca 8.4 mg7dl, CRP <0.5 mg/dl, NT proBNP 322 ng/l, other biochemistry normal. Haemoglobin 13.8 g/dl, haematocrit 41.1%, leukocytes 10400 ui (neutrophils 67%, lymphocytes 27%), platelets 385000 ui. Coagulation normal. Chest X-ray: normal CTI with no infiltrates or signs of pleural effusion. Echocardiography: non-dilated left ventricle with moderate to severe hypertrophy at septal level with preserved global LVEF (65%) with thinning and akinesia at lower basal segments and to a lesser extent inferolateral basal and posterior septal basal segments. Atria not dilated. Non-dilated right ventricle with preserved RVEF. Aortic root of normal dimensions. Normal mitral valve with trival mitral regurgitation jet. Trivalve aortic valve of normal morphology and jet of mild aortic insufficiency. Mild tricuspid regurgitation with normal PSAP. No pericardial effusion. Diastolic pattern compatible with type I relaxation disorder. Conclusion: aneurysm in the region of the basal inferior-septal, basal inferior and basal lateral-inferior segments with preserved LVEF. Cardiac MRI: mild left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 50%) with akinesia of basal inferior and inferolateral segments and late subendocardial enhancement at this level. Right ventricle of normal morphology and function. Coronary angiography: radial approach. Epicardial coronary arteries without lesions. Ventriculography shows a posterobasal aneurysm of the left ventricle and a small apical aneurysm. Preserved LVEF. Electrophysiological study: basal conduction intervals are normal. No ventricular pre-excitation or double nodal pathway. Pacing manoeuvres from CS and from the basal area of the RV do not induce tachycardia. Under isoproterenol perfusion (3 mcg/min), a tachycardia equal to the clinically documented tachycardia that meets the criteria of ventricular origin is spontaneously induced with ventricular extrasystoles. From the morphology of the complexes, it originates in the basal and superior zone of the LV (mitroaortic continuity, aortic semilunar, superior zone of the mitral annulus). Tachycardia is induced on several occasions and is suppressed by ventricular overstimulation. Blood and urine cultures: negative. Serology: HBV, HCV and HIV negative. Anti-Trypanosoma cruzi serology: positive.  EVOLUTION During her stay on the ward and while the TVMS study was being completed, the patient presented rapid palpitations with general malaise and dizziness, and the monitor showed a wide QRS tachycardia similar to the one described, which spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm. The patient was transferred to the coronary unit. After performing cardiac MRI and subsequent coronary angiography, which ruled out ischaemic origin in the presence of structural heart disease in the echocardiography (posterobasal aneurysm and small apical aneurysm) with the patient's personal history, everything led to suspect possible Chagas disease, so serology for Trypanosoma cruzi was requested, with positive results. A referral was made to the Infectious Diseases Unit, which considered the diagnosis of Chagas disease to be highly probable and requested serology and PCR for confirmation. Treatment with benznidazole was started. Due to clinical symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux and epigastric discomfort, an oesophago-gastro-duodenal transit was requested, which was negative. On the other hand, a new electrophysiological study was performed in order to try to ablate SMVT. However, no VT was induced during the procedure despite high doses of isoproterenol. Radiofrequency applications were performed in the anterolateral area of the mitral annulus without subsequent complications. After testing positive for Chagas disease, it was decided to implant a self-implantable defibrillator (ICD). Once the patient's condition had stabilised, it was decided to discharge her home to continue monitoring her at the ECCC. There was no impact on her outpatient evolution.  DIAGNOSIS Poorly tolerated sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia secondary to probable cardiomyopathy due to Chagas disease. Implantation of a single-chamber ICD as secondary prevention. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
History, current illness and physical examination A 61-year-old woman, with no cardiovascular risk factors or relevant medical history, attended her health centre for oppressive chest pain radiating to the back, associated with palpitations and dyspnoea, of one hour's duration. On arrival, he appeared to be in poor general condition with a heart rate of around 250 bpm and hypotension. An electrocardiogram was performed (figure 1), after which it was decided to call the emergency services and administer 300 mg of intravenous amiodarone. On arrival of the mobile ICU, the patient remained symptomatic and cardioversion had not been achieved. Given the presence of a tachyarrhythmia that was interpreted as ventricular tachycardia, poorly tolerated haemodynamically, it was decided to perform electrical cardioversion. After sedation, cardioversion was performed with three shocks (200-300-360 joules) without success, after which he was transferred urgently to his hospital of reference.   Further tests analysis: haemogram: haemoglobin 11.7 g/dl, haematocrit 36%, leucocytes 9,000/uL, platelets 183,000/uL. Coagulation normal. Blood glucose 225 mg/dl, creatinine 1.2 mg/dl, sodium 138 mmol/litre, potassium 4.1 mmol/litre, magnesium 1.9 mg/dl, lactate 2.4 mmol/litre, calcium 8.3 mmol/litre and troponin T 130 pg/ml. venous blood gases: pH 7.16, pCO2 54, HCO3 19, BE -9.7. ʟʟ ECG  Clinical evolution Admitted to the intensive care unit where treatment with intravenous lidocaine was started, achieving cardioversion with improvement in blood pressure. Once in sinus rhythm, the electrocardiogram showed a generalised decrease in the ST segment with an increase in aVR, so she contacted the cardiac critical care unit of our centre and was transferred for study. On arrival, the patient was asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable. On questioning, she denied previous episodes of chest pain or palpitations despite walking several kilometres daily. The baseline electrocardiogram showed pre-excitation.  An echocardiogram was performed showing Ebstein's anomaly with lateral leaflet of the tricuspid valve with low implantation (1.4 cm from the mitral valve) not previously known. The right ventricle was slightly dilated with slightly depressed systolic function and moderate-severe tricuspid insufficiency. The tachycardia record was reviewed with the electrophysiology service and, given the suspicion that the patient had supraventricular tachycardia, probably pre-excited atrial fibrillation, it was decided to perform an electrophysiological study and ablation. The study detected three accessory pathways: right posteroseptal, left posteroseptal and right inferolateral, and these were effectively ablated. As a complication, she presented mild pericardial effusion that remained unchanged during her evolution on the ward, and she was discharged asymptomatic with outpatient monitoring.

History, current illness and physical examination 54-year-old male patient with a history of arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, with no known allergies. Home treatment with insulin Lantus 24 IU/24h and rapid insulin 4 IU/8h, losartan 100 mg/24h. She came to the emergency department with a sensation of numbness in the right upper limb (MSD) the previous night, and when she woke up she was unable to move it. He denied any other symptoms. Conscious, oriented, alert. Normal language. Normal EOM. Normal cranial nerves. Paresis in MSD 3/5 and slight hypoesthesia. Rhythmic heart tones without murmurs. Preserved MV without added noises. No oedema in lower limbs. Rest normal.  Complementary tests CBC: normal haemogram, normal coagulation. Biochemistry with G 123 mg/dl, Cr 1 mg/dl. Cholesterol 192 mg/dl, LDL 133 mg/dl, TG 97 mg/dl. Rest normal. ECG: sinus rhythm at 54 bpm, normal axis, no repolarisation alterations. Cranial CT scan: ischaemic lesion in the most posterior portion of the left parietal lobe. There is another hypodense image of triangular morphology in the left frontal lobe suggesting ischaemic lesion. No other relevant findings. TSA echo-Doppler: parvus tardus wave at the level of the ICA in discordance with what was seen in B-mode and colour, which may be related to stenosis, so angio-MRI is recommended. Angio-MRI of TSA: no significant stenosis data are seen in the carotid bulbs or in the internal or external carotid arteries on both sides. Basilar and vertebral arteries are patent. Cerebral MRI: several lesions in the left MCA territory with diffusion restriction, corresponding to acute ischaemic lesions of probable embolic origin. Transthoracic echocardiogram: aI 35.9 mm and Ao 32 mm. Preserved LV systolic function with LVEF of 64%. Ventricular filling with altered relaxation pattern. Mild LVH. Peripheral intravenous FSS was injected and no bubbles were observed passing through the interatrial septum suggestive of PFO.  Clinical evolution The patient recovered muscle strength, but presented mild hypoaesthesia in the right arm. He was discharged with a diagnosis of left parietal and frontal cerebral infarction of uncertain nature; under treatment with Adiro 300 mg/24h and atorvastatin 80 mg/24h. She was readmitted after 8 months due to vertiginous symptoms, vomiting, dysarthria and gait instability, as well as horizontal nystagmus to the left which, in addition to the previous infarcts, showed a new lesion in the cranial CAT scan, compatible with acute infarction in the left PICA territory. The cardiological study was normal and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was requested on a scheduled basis. He was discharged with a diagnosis of cryptogenetic left cerebellar ischaemic stroke, and treatment with Sintrom, suspending Adiro. TEE was performed and reported as no dilatation of cavities. Thinning of the interatrial septum at the level of the foramen ovale without macroscopic detachment and without abnormalities in mobility, with no signs of shunt seen with colour Doppler. Echocontrast was performed with agitated colloidal solution both at baseline and after the Valsalva manoeuvre. Early passage of microbubbles to the left cavities was observed after the Valsalva manoeuvre. The patient remained stable during follow-up without new cardioembolic episodes.

History, current illness and physical examination A 64-year-old man consulted for right-sided sudden amaurosis. Personal history: allergy to penicillin, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity and smoking. Without providing reports, he refers that he was admitted to another hospital in 2007 for a left hemispheric stroke from which he recovered without sequelae and was being followed up for valvular heart disease. Regular treatment with enalapril, simvastatin and clopidogrel. Present illness: sudden total visual loss of the right eye after 24 hours of evolution. No dyspnoea, chest pain, fever or any other symptoms.  Physical examination: BP 145/88 mmHg, 88 bpm, 36.7 oC, conscious, oriented, eupneic, hydrated and normal colour. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without added noise. Cardiac auscultation revealed a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur in the aorta, radiating to the carotids, and a grade III/VI systolic murmur in the left sternal border, radiating to the axilla. Abdomen and limbs without notable findings.  Complementary tests PA chest X-ray: absence of cardiomegaly, no pleural effusion, no infiltrates or consolidations. Electrocardiography: sinus rhythm at 91 bpm, left cardiac axis at -45o. Left atrial enlargement. Cornell criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Left anterior hemiblock. ST descending 1 mm drop in I and AvL with negative T wave in these leads. No dynamic changes in repolarisation. QTc 443 msec. CBC: 12,000 leukocytes, Hb 11.5 g/dl, 335,000 platelets. Coagulation normal. ESR 39 mm/h, CRP 4.27 mg/L. Biochemistry and thyroid function normal. ANA, anti-DNA and ANCA negative. Hypercoagulability study without pathological findings. Serology (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Coxiella, Lúes, Brucella and HBV) negative. Right eye fundus: red-cherry macula, whitish oedema due to ischaemia, narrowing of retinal arteries and whitish exudates. Transesophageal echocardiogram: very unstructured aortic valve with severe thickening and calcification with severe aortic stenosis (mean gradient 50 mmHg), mild aortic insufficiency. Mitral valve with several images suggestive of warts. On the atrial side of the posterior leaflet there are two images of mobile vegetations, the largest of 6 mm. There is a jet of mild mitral insufficiency suggesting perforation of the posterior leaflet. Severe left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved LVEF. Absence of patent foramen ovale by injection of agitated saline. CT angiography of supra-aortic trunks: carotid atherosclerosis and in the CT angiography of TSA, 60-70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Independent blood cultures x3: positive for Streptococcus viridans.  Clinical course After evaluation by ophthalmology at our centre, a diagnosis of right central retinal artery occlusion (RTAO) was made. The patient was admitted to internal medicine for further investigation. Carotid atherosclerosis was observed in the supra-aortic trunk duplex (TSA) and 60-70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery in the TSA angio-CT scan. Despite the carotid findings that could justify the picture, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed to search for an embolic source, showing severe aortic stenosis, degenerative signs in the mitral valve (MV) with mild mitral insufficiency (MI) and calcium in its annulus. Due to the poor echocardiographic window, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, which confirmed the existence of severe aortic stenosis with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), visualising vegetations on the MV and perforation of the posterior leaflet. The patient was afebrile and three blood cultures were taken, with Streptococcus viridans growing in all samples. With the diagnosis of subacute mitral infective endocarditis (IE) on native valve (and possibly aortic) and the history described, he was treated with vancomycin and gentamicin according to the usual regimen. The patient remained afebrile throughout admission, with negative control blood cultures. Control TTE and TEE were performed, with disappearance of vegetations and mild-moderate MI as sequelae. After resolution of the infective endocarditis, he was referred to the outpatient vascular surgery department for evaluation of carotid endarterectomy and to cardiology for follow-up of his valvular heart disease. Two months after admission, carotid surgery was performed and subsequently, due to the onset of symptoms, aortic valve replacement with metallic prosthesis was performed without complications and with good cardiovascular evolution. However, the patient has not recovered vision in the right eye.   Diagnosis Occlusion of the central artery of the right retina. Subacute endocarditis on native mitral valve due to Streptococcus viridans. Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis with preserved LVEF. Significant right carotid stenosis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
History, current illness and physical examination 76-year-old patient with no known drug allergies and a personal medical history of: arterial hypertension (AHT), dyslipidaemia (DLP), sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS) under treatment with CPAP and diverticular disease; and surgical history of: operation for Morton's neuroma, hallux valgus of both feet and excision of a rectal polyp.  Usual treatment: enalapril, statin and omeprazole.  Current illness: she attended the emergency department on 10/10/2013 for moderate exertional dyspnoea of 15 days' evolution, orthopnoea, non-radiating pain in the lower sternal region, without vegetative cortex and unrelated to exertion and increasing chronic oedema in the lower extremities. 20 days earlier she had consulted for the same clinical condition and was admitted with a diagnosis of heart failure, but the patient refused because she had a trip planned, so she was prescribed a diuretic and, in the absence of improvement, consulted again.  Physical examination: blood pressure (BP) 95/65 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 79 bpm, O2 saturation 95%. Bilateral jugular ingurgitation. Hepatojugular reflux (HJR) +. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic with slightly muffled sounds. Pulmonary auscultation: bibasal hypoventilation. Lower extremities: bilateral malleolar oedema.  Complementary tests ECG: sinus rhythm at 75 bpm with decreased voltages. Blood tests: normal cardiac enzymes, normal thyroid function, CRP 0.74, urea 56, creatinine 0.91, normal ions. Haemogram: leucocytes 8,200 (68% n), red series and platelets normal. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram: pericardial effusion mainly anterolateral to the right cavities, with 22 mm separation of pericardial sheets. From subxiphoid access, separation of leaves of 15-20 mm. In the posterior area 8-10 mm. In the anterior pericardial sac, a mass of a somewhat heterogeneous appearance (cysts?, necrosis areas?) approximately 5 cm thick is observed over the right cavities (from just before the AV groove) and over the ascending aorta, which does not cause compression of the cavities and does not appear to infiltrate the myocardium. ʟʟ Hemodynamic compromise data: AD collapse, respiratory transmitral flow variations >25%, dilated inferior vena cava (22 mm) without inspiratory collapse. ʟʟ normal LV. Mild-moderate aortic insufficiency. Normal RV. Mild TR: RV-AD gradient 20 mm Hg. Estimated PAPs 40 mmHg. Left pleural effusion. Thoracoabdominal CT: significant pericardial effusion with separation of sheets up to 30 mm in the right anterior pericardium. Voluminous mass dependent on pericardial sheets, polylobulated and heterogeneous, which overflows the pericardium and extends to the anterosuperior mediastinum, suggestive of malignant neoplasm, of probable pericardial sarcomatous origin, without being able to exclude other possibilities such as mesothelioma, lymphoma, metastasis, etc. Thyroid enlargement, mainly in the right lobe where small hypodense nodules can be seen. Right tracheobronchial lymph node calcifications and small non-specific left prevascular lymphadenopathy, with no evidence of other lymphadenopathy suggesting metastatic origin. Bilateral pleural effusion in greater quantity on the left side, causing passive atelectasis of the left lower lobe, with no evidence of underlying lung mass. Residual fibrous lesions, apical right. Mild hepatomegaly, with no evidence of focal lesions suggestive of metastasis. Normal kidneys and adrenal glands. Spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and biliary tract without notable alterations. Conclusion: suspected malignant neoplasm of pericardial origin with significant pericardial effusion. Bilateral pleural effusion, greater on the left side, with passive atelectasis of LII. Pericardial fluid analysis: biochemical analysis: ADA113.1, glucose 0.88, protein 37 g/dl. Cytological analysis: oligocellular cytology including mature neutrophils and lymphocytes with some isolated activated mesothelial cells. No atypical cells are seen. Inconclusive. Microbiological analysis: negative aerobic and anaerobic culture, direct smear microscopy (staining: Ziehl-Nielsen) with no evidence of AARB, smear microscopy after decontamination (staining: auramine) with no evidence of AARB, negative PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, negative mycobacterial culture. Biopsy: biphasic lesion, epithelial and lymphoid, with pattern suggestive of thymoma. Report notes: 1st reference of possible mass in anterior mediastinum, not filiated but CT and thoracic surgery impression is of pericardial primary lesion/tumour with mediastinal ballooning, 2nd the biphasic pattern with epithelial population (TTF1 (-) and with negative mesothelial markers (calretininin and WT1) and in symbiosis/intimate relationship with small size lymphoid population and "thymic" phenotype (CD45+ CD+, Tdt+, CD99+) suggests in the first instance thymoma, but does not refer to a thymic mass (although ectopic thymomas have been described), although the unlikely possibility of a T-type lymphoblastic lymphoma cannot be ruled out. For all these reasons, a sample was sent to another hospital which confirmed the diagnosis of thymoma.  Clinical course Given the presence of pericardial effusion with haemodynamic compromise, the patient was admitted to the ICU and evacuating pericardiocentesis was performed via the subxiphoid route with serohaematic fluid output and samples were sent for biochemistry, microbiology and pathological anatomy. After clinical stabilisation, the patient was sent to the cardiology ward for further study and treatment. A pericardial effusion study was performed, requesting a complete blood analysis, autoimmunity study, Mantoux, smear microscopy, thoracoabdominal CT scan, chest X-ray and control echocardiogram. Laboratory tests (including thyroid function) showed no significant alterations, Mantoux test and smear microscopy were negative and the autoimmunity study was normal. The thoracoabdominal CT scan indicated high suspicion of malignant neoplasm of pericardial origin with significant pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusion. In view of the presence of malignant neoplasia in the anterior pericardium extending to the anterior superior mediastinum, the Thoracic Surgery Department was requested to collaborate. On 29/10/13 mediastinoscopy was performed with biopsy, and a cardiac mass infiltrating the lung was observed during the procedure. On 30 October he returned to the ICU for respiratory failure due to increased left pleural effusion that required evacuating thoracentesis with an output of 1,000 cc. The biopsy reported thymoma, however, a sample was sent to another hospital to corroborate the diagnosis because the impression of the imaging tests (CT) and thoracic surgery was of a primary pericardial lesion/tumour with mediastinal bulging and because the diagnosis of T-type lymphoblastic lymphoma could not be definitively ruled out due to the anatomopathological data and the absence of visualisation of thymic masses (although ectopic thymomas have been described). The diagnosis of thymoma was confirmed. In view of this finding, a myasthenia gravis study was requested by neurology, which ruled it out. On 16 December, surgery was performed to try to remove the tumour. This consisted of a median sternotomy and access to the anterior mediastinum, which could only be exploratory as a large tumour mass was observed with infiltration of the right upper lobe, junction to the cava and pericardium, making dissection impossible. She was assessed by the oncology department and no curative treatment could be started. Given the poor clinical situation and the null possibility of curative treatment, analgesia was intensified and the patient died.

History, current illness and physical examination A 43-year-old man, with no previous history of interest, who has been doing intense aerobic sports (athletics and paddle tennis) for about 7 hours a week since childhood, was referred to the Cardiology department for the finding of isolated monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles (VE) on ECG performed during an examination at work. Physical examination was normal.  Complementary tests Echocardiogram, chest X-ray and laboratory tests showed no abnormalities. There were no signs or symptoms of ischaemia in the exercise stress test, but the density of ventricular extrasystoles increased slightly at maximum effort.  Clinical course Treatment was started with bisoprolol 5 mg per day and the Holter monitoring recorded disappearance of VE but nocturnal atrioventricular block (AVB) with several pauses, the longest of 12 seconds. The patient remained asymptomatic at all times and denied any family history of conduction disorder, dilated cardiomyopathy or sudden death. The Holter monitoring was interpreted as advanced AVB, bisoprolol was discontinued and the patient was admitted for study and monitoring. Nocturnal pauses were recorded in relation to AVB and/or sinus bradycardia of up to 7 seconds and very occasional VS. Baseline conduction was found to be normal by electrophysiological study and sleep apnoea was ruled out by polysomnography. Given the poor clinical situation and the lack of curative treatment possibilities, analgesia was intensified and the patient died.  Diagnosis In view of the absence of structural heart disease and relevant family history, he was diagnosed with VAB mediated by vagal hypertonia and was advised to reduce his sporting activity, but he refused. The risk-benefit balance of implanting a single-chamber pacemaker was explained to him and he refused. During follow-up he remained asymptomatic, although Holter ECG monitoring showed that nocturnal pauses lasting up to 9 seconds persisted. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: 54-year-old male. No known drug allergies. AHT with good control, dyslipidaemic and active smoker 1.5 packs/day. Ex-drinker. Hyperuricaemia. Chronic bronchitis type COPD. Under cardiology follow-up for moderate double aortic lesion and mild pulmonary hypertension. Occupation: waiter.  Present illness: he came to the emergency department with progressive dyspnoea of one month's duration. Initial evaluation showed narrow QRS tachycardia at 144 bpm with irregular RR that reverted to sinus rhythm after administration of verapamil and amiodarone. During observation, the patient presented haemodynamic deterioration, with arterial hypotension, poor perfusion, profuse sweating and volumetric resuscitation was started, a femoral line was cannulated and nor-adrenaline perfusion was started. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing biventricular dilatation with severe dysfunction without segmental disorders, moderate mitral insufficiency, moderate double aortic lesion and moderate-severe tricuspid insufficiency. The patient was admitted to the ICU and cardiogenic shock persisted. Chest CT was requested and pulmonary thromboembolism was ruled out. The patient was monitored and cardiogenic shock pattern with IC 1.5 was observed, so dobutamine, noradrenaline and levosimendan were started and the haemodynamic situation recovered and improved progressively, and could be withdrawn in 48 hours. During his stay in the ICU, a new regulated transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing an improvement in LVEF (50-55% subjective), moderate functional mitral regurgitation and double aortic lesion with severe aortic regurgitation. It was decided to perform a TEE and the existence of severe aortic insufficiency was confirmed, with two jets, one due to prolapse of the right coronary leaflet, directed towards the anterior mitral leaflet and the other appears to be caused by a possible perforation of the base of the right coronary leaflet.  Physical examination: poor general condition. Skin coldness. Profuse sweating. Jugular ingurgitation. ACR: arrhythmic tones at 130 bpm. Systolic-diastolic murmur III/VI predominantly in aortic focus. MVC with crackles up to midfields in both lung fields.  Complementary tests CBC: glucose 97, creatinine 0.65, potassium 4.7, GGT 44, CT 145, LDL 88. Hb 46.1. Htco 47. ʟʟ Blood cultures: negative. ECG: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at 130 bpm. Thoracic CT scan: a study was performed with intravenous contrast administration from the bases to the apex of the lungs. Adequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree bilaterally, without identifying intravascular repletion defects suggestive of PTE. No evidence of mediastinal or axillary adenopathy of pathological size or other notable abnormalities in the mediastinum. Lung parenchyma was normal bilaterally, without nodular images or alterations of the parenchymal architecture. Contrast reflux to the suprahepatic veins in the context of heart failure. High abdominal sections show perihepatic free fluid lengue and relative hypertrophy of the left hepatic lobe, which may be secondary to chronic liver disease. Conclusion: PTE is ruled out. TT echocardiogram: moderately-severely dilated left ventricle, with mild concentric hypertrophy and global systolic function at low limits of normality (monoplane Simpson LVEF 49%, subjective 50-55%, Teicholz 54%). LA dilated (34 cm2). RV neither dilated nor hypertrophic with preserved global systolic function. Dilated RA. Mitral valve with non thickened leaflets, without significant morphological alterations, preserved opening, appreciating MI directed towards the posterolateral wall of LA which appears to be moderately functional. There are no images suggestive of endocarditis at the mitral valve level. Tricuspid aortic valve, fibrosclerosed, with severe thickening of the right coronary leaflet, which presents a hyperechogenic nodular image on which sits a less echodense and flapping image suggestive of endocarditis wart. Prolapse of the right coronary leaflet can be seen, causing a very eccentric AoI, which appears to be severe. The apical projection shows two regurgitation jets, one directed towards the anterior mitral leaflet caused by the prolapse of the right coronary leaflet and the other directed towards the ventricular septum/cavity. Slightly restricted opening with mean AoTG of 22 mmHg, AVAo per EC of 1.99 cm2. Mild TR allowing estimation of PSAP of 29 mmHg + PAD (dilated IVC with inspiratory collapse of approximately 50%). No pulmonary valvulopathy was observed. Normal ascending aorta. Septum intact. No pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram: severe AoI was observed, best visualised in the mid-oesophageal projection at 120o, conditioned by the existence of 2 regurgitation jets that occupy almost all of the LVOT. One of them originates from prolapse of the right coronary leaflet, directed towards the anterior mitral leaflet. The other appears to be caused by a possible perforation of the base of the right coronary leaflet. Grade III MR is seen, conditioned by a scarce coaptation of mitral leaflets of functional origin, reaching the atrial roof with a 6 mm vena contracta. There were no images suggestive of endocarditis on the mitral valve. The atrial appendage is free of thrombus. The rest is compatible with the TTE study. Conclusion: study suggestive of endocarditis on the aortic valve, severe AoI, mild AoE. Grade III MI. LVEF in low limits of normality.  Clinical evolution The patient was referred to the cardiac surgery unit and underwent successful surgery with implantation of mitral and aortic metallic prosthesis. The native mitral and aortic valves were removed and endocardial involvement by Coxiella burnetii was diagnosed. During follow-up, the patient presented multiple falls in atrial flutter with 2 CVE and recurrence, as well as severe ventricular dysfunction and multiple episodes of NSVT on Holter. He was referred to the arrhythmia unit and CTI ablation was performed and a CRT+ADI pacemaker was implanted, with improvement in LVEF during follow-up, and he is currently in GF I-II.  Diagnosis Cardiogenic shock in the context of tachycardiomyopathy due to rapid atrial fibrillation of uncertain onset and treatment with verapamil. Mitro-aortic endocarditis due to Coxiella burnetii. Implantation of metallic mitral and aortic prostheses. Successful CTI ablation. Implantation of ICD + CRT with improvement of LVEF. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
History, current disease and physical examination A 25-year-old man came to the cardiology department after an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response while exercising on the beach and was treated by pharmacological cardioversion with amiodarone in the emergency department. The patient had been experiencing episodes of palpitations related to intense exertion for a year. He had no functional class deterioration or other cardiovascular symptoms.  Personal history: In preparation for competitive firefighter training. Labelled episodes of anxiety with chest pain, sensation of dyspnoea and acute elevation of blood pressure. No other cardiovascular risk factors or drug use. Mallory Weiss syndrome. ʟʟ No regular medication.   Family history: one brother had died of transposition of great vessels and ventricular septal defect, another brother had died in utero due to interruption of the aortic arch and he had a cousin with pre-excitation syndrome.  Physical examination: conscious, oriented, normal colour, eupneic. Normal phenotype. Blood pressure 218/110 mmHg in right upper limb, 169/86 mmHg in left upper limb. Peripheral pulses present. Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur, cardiac auscultation: ejective proto-mesosystolic murmur in aortic focus and left parasternal border grade II over LV also audible in interscapular focus. Abdomen and lower limbs without findings.  Complementary tests Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm with normal cardiac axis. Presence of incomplete right bundle branch block and signs suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest X-ray: no cardiomegaly, absence of pleural effusion or pulmonary infiltrates. Rib indentations are seen. Transthoracic echocardiogram: mild septal hypertrophy, mild mitral anterolateral leaflet prolapse with trivial mitral insufficiency. In the suprasternal window, a flow acceleration and gradient of 86.6 mmHg in the descending thoracic aorta below the left subclavian outflow was noted. The rest of the study including left atrial dimensions and left ventricular diastolic function was normal. Thoracic-abdominal CT angiography: presence of aortic coarctation distal to the ostium of the left subclavian artery with a reduction of the aortic lumen to 0.6 cm in diameter, with hypertrophy of the left intercostal arteries distal to the coarctation, the left subclavian artery and the left mammary artery. Nuclear magnetic resonance angiography: saccular aneurysm adjacent to the bifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery. Normal karyotype, absence of 22q11.2 selection.   Clinical course Given the findings compatible with coarctation of the descending aorta and the diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the patient was admitted to the cardiology ward to complete the study and decide on the therapeutic approach. Thoracic-abdominal CT angiography was performed, which confirmed coarctation distal to the ostium of the left subclavian artery. Given the association of this aortic pathology with cerebrovascular malformations, it was decided to perform a cerebral magnetic resonance angiography, which revealed an aneurysm in the middle cerebral artery. In addition, given the family history, karyotyping was performed and a FISH hybridisation study of one of the deletions associated with this type of pathology was carried out, both tests being normal. With the diagnoses described, the case was presented at the clinical session, and the decision was made to first operate on the cerebral aneurysm and then to surgically correct the coarctation of the aorta. The patient underwent successful surgery and is currently asymptomatic.

History, current illness and physical examination A 48-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity and ex-smoker. After fumigating for approximately 3 continuous hours with organophosphates without any protection, he suddenly presented with intense dyspnoea, diaphoresis and intense oppressive central thoracic pain radiating to both upper limbs; his family described that he went home after the onset of the symptoms with twitching in the upper limbs, trembling in both hands and inability to speak due to abundant salivation and bronchorrhoea. His family took him to the local hospital. On arrival he presented cardiorespiratory arrest in VF rhythm, resuscitation manoeuvres were started, and after 5 shocks the rhythm was reversed, but the patient was still haemodynamically unstable with significant respiratory insufficiency, so vasoactive support and orotracheal intubation were started. After 45 minutes of resuscitation manoeuvres, ECG showed complete AV block with escape rhythm at 45 bpm and ST elevation in II-III-aVF, from V3 to V6 and V3R-V4R, and specular decrease in I-aVL-V1-V2. Fibrinolysis was decided as there was no Haemodynamics Unit at the centre and CORECAM (Castilla la Mancha Infarction Code) was activated. Despite NKT, the patient persisted with ST elevation and was referred for rescue PTCA.  Physical examination: relaxed sedentary patient, mechanically ventilated and requiring high doses of vasoactive drugs. BP 70/40, HR 30 bpm, RR 20, afebrile, SaO2 100% MV. Head and neck: miosis and abundant sialorrhoea. Cardiac auscultation: bradycardic, rhythmic and regular. Lung fields with inspiratory and expiratory wheezing, crackling rales in both bases and abundant mobilisation of secretions. Abdomen globular, soft, depressible, not assessable. Extremities with fasciculations and generalised myoclonus.  Complementary tests CBC: leukocytes 22,300 with adequate differential count, Hb 14.3, haematocrit 43%, platelets 221,000, Act. PT 83%, fibrinogen 258, glucose 513 mg/dl, urea 43, creatinine 1.6, total protein: 6.7, GOT 832, GPT 578, LDH 1257, amylase 117. ʟʟ Ions: Na 134, K 2.8, Cl 101, Ca 7.7, P 12.8, Mg 1.3. ʟʟʟ Myocardial injury markers at 8 hours after onset CPK 2813, CK MB 264 and TnI 43.4. Peak enzyme at 24 hours CPK 6,586, CK MB >304 and TnI >76. ʟʟ Blood gases: PH 7.01, PCO2 38, PO2 261, HCO3 12.6, lactic acid 92. Electrocardiogram before entering the haemodynamics room: unchanged with respect to that described prior to fibrinolysis. Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index at the high limit of normality. Interstitial infiltrate in both lower fields. Transthoracic echocardiogram (vasoactive support and mechanical ventilation): non-dilated LV, with inferoposterior akinesia and mid-apical septal, without signs of valvular heart disease or mechanical complications, with LVEF of 42%.   Clinical course The patient was admitted directly to the haemodynamics ward. Prior to coronary angiography, a transient intravenous pacemaker was implanted via the right femoral vein and balloon counterpulsation via the left femoral artery. Coronary angiography showed right dominance, LMCA without lesions, LAD with parietal irregularities without significant stenosis, hypodeveloped Cx without stenosis and DC with complicated plaque and associated thrombus in the proximal region, distal vessel permeable with distal flow Timi 2-3 (video 1). Angioplasty guide wire is passed to distal DC and direct stent implantation in proximal DC up to the ostium; after which she presents no-reflow phenomenon that remits after intracoronary vasodilators. In ECG after rescue PTCA, sinus rhythm at 105 bpm, QS in II-III-aVF, transition from QRS V1 to V2 with high R in V2 and V3, persistent ST alterations (ST elevation in II-III-aVF and decrease in I-aVL-V1-V2), AV block grade I with PR 220 msec. In view of the fact that his acute coronary symptoms had resolved and that the patient had symptoms (dyspnoea, abundant salivation, bronchorrhoea, fasciculations, hand tremor), signs (miosis, sialorrhoea, bronchospasm, bronchorrhoea, bradycardia, AV block, myoclonias) and analytical findings (leukocytosis, hyperglycaemia, renal failure, hypokalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia, metabolic acidosis) suggestive of organophosphate poisoning; given the duration of cardiorespiratory arrest, it was decided to initiate hypothermia, atropinisation, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium sulphate, as well as haemodynamic and ventilatory support. Despite maintaining adequate haemodynamic and ventilatory support, and achieving correction of metabolic acidosis, the patient progressed to progressive deterioration, renal failure requiring continuous haemodiafiltration, signs of hepatotoxicity and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the first 48 hours. ECG after 48 hours of evolution in sinus rhythm at 74 bpm, QS in II-III-aVF, high R in V2 and V3, slight ST elevation in II-III-aVF and slight decrease in I-aVLV1- V2), AV block grade I with PR 220 msec. Two weeks after being in the ICU, he presented even more neurological deterioration, becoming spastic, with hyper-reactivity of tendon reflexes, signs of dysautonomia and coldness of the extremities. After a torpid evolution and presenting, among other complications typical of prolonged admission to the ICU, respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock due to Pseudomona, the patient died after 48 days in the ICU.  Diagnosis Cardiorespiratory arrest witnessed in ventricular fibrillation. Prolonged advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Severe organophosphate poisoning.

Male patient, 31 years old, construction worker. No known drug allergies, ex-smoker of half a packet/day for 5 years, not an excessive drinker, not a consumer of other toxic substances. No significant personal or family history.  History, current illness and physical examination Previously asymptomatic, he presented with intense pain, coldness and generalised pallor in the left hand of sudden onset (without previous trauma) while carrying out his daily tasks, for which he consulted his health centre. As no radial or ulnar pulse was found, the patient was referred to our hospital where he was assessed in the emergency department by Vascular Surgery, which documented acute occlusion of the humeral artery, which led to an urgent embolectomy without incident, embolic material was sent for pathological anatomy and a cardiological assessment and echocardiography were requested. On physical examination the patient was in good general condition, conscious, oriented and cooperative. Well hydrated and perfused, eupneic at rest and tolerating decubitus. Afebrile, BP 110/70, HR 70xmin, normal cardiopulmonary auscultation, no signs of heart failure. Embolectomy wound in MSI with no data of complication. The rest of the physical examination was completely normal. A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed at the bedside, which revealed a mass in the lateral wall of the left atrium and the patient was admitted to Cardiology for further study.  Complementary tests - Analysis: Complete blood count, coagulation and profiles with no noteworthy data. - Electrocardiogram: Sinus rhythm maintained, no repolarisation alterations, conduction disorders or findings suggestive of cavity growth. - Chest X-ray: Normal cardiac silhouette. Absence of congestive pattern, no pleural effusion. No space-occupying images in lung parenchyma. - Echocardiography TT/TE + ECO 3D: Mass of 40x27 mm that occupies the entire left atrial appendage, protrudes out of it towards the atrium, has irregular edges with some areas of increased echogenicity suggesting fibrosis and on the atrial surface has filamentous and mobile extension of 12 mm with characteristics of high embolic risk. The left pulmonary veins are not invaded, with normal flow. The ADA and ACX are seen in the AV groove below the atrial appendage, without being invaded. Normal mitral valve, aortic valve and right valves. Left ventricle of normal dimensions, wall thickness and contractility. Normal right chambers. No pericardial effusion. - Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Tissue formation in the left atrium that completely occupies the atrial appendage and extends into the atrial cavity as a vegetative mass with well-defined contours, attached to the upper and lateral wall. It measures approximately 4cm in its maximum axis which is craniocaudal. In the four-chamber plane it measures approximately 34x27mm. Although it is adjacent to the pulmonary ostium, these remain patent. It is not related to the mitral valve or the interatrial septum. It has homogeneous and intermediate signal intensity in all sequences. In the late enhancement sequences, annular peripheral fine enhancement is found, which can be observed in myxomas. No alterations in thickness and segmental and global contractility or alterations in tissue signal or late enhancement in myocardium. No cardiovascular anatomical alterations.  Clinical evolution During his stay on the hospital ward, the patient remained asymptomatic and without incident. In the imaging tests mentioned above, a differential diagnosis was made between atrial myxoma of atypical location vs. thrombus. In the pathological anatomy study of embolic material, high-grade cellular atypia suggestive of malignant neoplasia was found. Cardiac surgery was consulted and the case was accepted for resection of the mass under extracorporeal circulation and the procedure was carried out without complications. The intraoperative pathological anatomy study confirmed high-grade dysplasia, and the left atrial appendage was resected over its entire length, achieving lesion-free margins. During his stay in the ICU he evolved favourably without incident and after stabilisation he was transferred to the cardiac surgery ward. The definitive pathological anatomy study of the resected mass was reported as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, an extension study was performed with thoracoabdominal CT where no metastatic lesions were documented and it was decided to discharge him on anticoagulation and to carry out out outpatient follow-up with Oncology. Two weeks after surgery, the patient was readmitted for clinical manifestations compatible with embolic stroke secondary to tandem occlusion of the left internal carotid artery and left middle cerebral artery. He was successfully treated by mechanical thrombectomy and the patient was left without residual neurological deficit; the pathological anatomy study of the embolic material confirmed its tumoural aetiology. He was subsequently admitted to Oncology, and a repeat TTE and extension study (cranial MRI, thoracoabdominal CT and bone scintigraphy) documented a recurrence of the mass in the left atrium with similar size and characteristics to those described in the pre-surgical study and the presence of brain, lung, liver, adrenal and bone metastases. Chemotherapy with adriamycin was started. Despite chemotherapy treatment, the patient had an unfavourable evolution and died three months after the initial diagnosis was made.    Diagnosis - Undifferentiated pleomorphic cardiac sarcoma with early recurrence after surgical resection. - Rapidly progressive multiple metastatic disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A 63-year-old woman presented with a clinical picture of three months' evolution consisting of feverish peaks with shivering, intense asthenia, hyporexia and a weight loss of 7 kg. She had previously required dental manipulation (osseo-integrated implants).  History, current illness and physical examination No medical history of interest, no cardiovascular risk factors, no toxic habits or surgical history, no known drug allergies. Blood tests performed by the primary care physician showed normocytic anaemia and persistent leucocyturia and haematuria in urine, so treatment was started with ferrous salts and two 10-day cycles of treatment with ciprofloxacin 400 mg/12h, one month apart, achieving improvement in general condition and disappearance of fever, which reappeared 7 days after the end of the last cycle of treatment. He suddenly presented with motor aphasia, left facial paralysis and loss of strength in the left upper limb; the neurological symptoms were fluctuating and recurrent, with residual weakness persisting in the left upper limb, and after visiting the emergency department he was admitted to the Neurology Department for examination. Physical examination on admission: BP 110/60 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, O2 sat 98% baseline. Conscious, oriented, reactive, perceptive. No palpable lymphadenopathies. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart tones at 85 bpm, pansystolic murmur of intensity III/VI at mitral focus, radiating to the axilla. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, no masses or megaliths palpable. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. Neurological examination in the emergency department revealed: very mild motor aphasia, left central facial paralysis and paresis of the left upper limb with strength 4/5.  Complementary tests - Blood tests: Normal renal function with GRF MDRD-4 79.27 ml/min/1.73 m2, normal ions. ESR up to 62 mm/hour. Maximum CRP of 4.65 mg/dl. Maximum procalcitonin 1.08 ng/ml. Normal liver function: FA 62U/l, GGT 41U/l, GOT 17 U/l, GPT 20U/l, LDH 222 U/l. Regarding the haemogram: Leukocytes 6600/μl with 64% neutrophils. Haemoglobin 10.1 g/dl, MCV 91.80 fL, CHM 34 pg. Platelets 13,600 0/ mcl. - ECG: Sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, normal PR, normal QRS, 60o axis, without repolarisation alterations. - Chest X-ray: cardiomediastinal silhouette without alterations, without pleuroparenchymal findings of acute evolution. - CT scan of the brain: No space-occupying lesions or midline displacements were observed. No acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic lesions. Cisternal and ventricular system without alterations. No significant radiological findings. - Thoracoabdominal CT scan: hepatosplenomegaly, uterine myoma. Rest of the examination with no significant findings. - Transcranial Doppler and echo-Doppler of supra-aortic trunks: Normal, no findings. - Lumbar puncture: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemistry: No alterations. CSF serology: Lúes, Borrelia and Brucella negative. CSF microbiology: CSF Gram: no microorganisms were observed. DNA of herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster by PCR negative. - Serology of serum/plasma: No findings for lupus, hepatitis B and C, HIV, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, Borrelia burgdorferi. - Microbiology. Blood cultures: Gram-positive coccobacilli in chains (in 2 of 2 samples sent initially) with final isolation of Abiotrophia defectiva, of intermediate sensitivity to penicillin (MIC 0.25), sensitive to the rest of antibiotics tested. Urine culture: Negative. - Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography: Left ventricle not dilated, hyperdynamic, LVEF 80%. Left atrium not dilated. Mitral valve: Prolapse of the P1 festoon of the posterior leaflet. Image of 8x6 mm in the cusp of festoon A1 of the anterior leaflet, with anarchic movement, echolucent areas inside, suggestive of endocardial vegetation. Severe mitral insufficiency towards the septum and anterior wall that reverses the flow in pulmonary veins. Restrictive filling pattern with elevated end-diastolic pressure data. Normal aortic valve and flow. Aortic root of normal size. Normal right chambers, no IT detected that would allow estimation of PAP. No pericardial effusion.  Clinical evolution Given the echocardiographic findings of endocarditis on the mitral valve (with prolapse of the P1 festoon of the posterior leaflet and vegetation on the cusp of the A1 festoon of the anterior leaflet) with severe mitral insufficiency with haemodynamic repercussions, and data suggestive of acute severe valvular regurgitation (absence of dilatation of left chambers) with a picture of probable peripheral embolism at cerebral level (with normal neurological tests), it was decided to transfer him to the Coronary Unit for initial evolutionary control: During five days in the unit, the patient remained haemodynamically stable, without requiring vasoactive drugs, remaining normotensive and in sinus rhythm at 90-100 bpm. Renal function was preserved, with good diuretic response at low doses and no clinical or radiological signs of heart failure. From the neurological point of view: Glasgow 15, persistence of central left facial paresis and with improvement of strength and sensitivity of the left upper extremity until normalisation. She was subsequently transferred to the cardiology ward for follow-up. From the beginning, the patient was followed up by the Infectious Diseases Unit: Initially, given the clinical suspicion of endocarditis of three months' evolution and the findings in blood cultures of gram-positive coccobacilli in chains (suspected streptococcus), empirical antibiotherapy was started with ceftriaxone (2 g iv/24 hours) associated with gentamicin (3 mg/kg/day iv/24 hours) and vancomycin (30 mg/kg/day iv in 2 doses/24h), achieving rapid disappearance of fever. Once the germ was identified in blood cultures as abiotrophia defectiva, after 10 days of empirical treatment, it was decided to modify antiobiotherapy to ampicillin (2g/4h) + ceftriaxone (2 g/12h), which had to be suspended after an urticarial reaction secondary to its administration. The new antibiotic regimen consisted of vancomycin + gentamicin, with negative fever and blood cultures, and a total of six weeks of antibiotic therapy was recommended. After two weeks of antibiotic treatment, a new transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, with findings similar to the initial one: persistence of severe mitral insufficiency, prolapse of the P1 festoon and an image suggestive of endocarditis over the A1 festoon. Four weeks after the start of antibiotic therapy, scheduled surgery was performed to replace the mitral valve with a St Jude No 29 mechanical prosthesis, without preservation of the posterior subvalvular apparatus. The entire procedure was uneventful. Good postoperative evolution in the ICU and on the Cardiac Surgery ward without arrhythmias, with early withdrawal of inotropes and mechanical ventilation, normal renal function and absence of fever. In agreement with the Infectious Diseases Unit, it was decided to discontinue antibiotic treatment 6 weeks after its initiation, after confirming negative microbiology in the heart valve sample, with control blood cultures after 48 hours (which were negative) and subsequent follow-up in the Outpatient Department. Prior to discharge, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing normal mitral prosthetic function and no images suggestive of endocarditis. Asymptomatic and stable, she was discharged from hospital. She was followed up in outpatient clinics without incident.  Diagnosis - Infective endocarditis on native mitral valve (with valvular prolapse of the p1 leaflet of the posterior leaflet and endocardial vegetation in the a1 leaflet of the anterior leaflet) with severe mitral insufficiency with haemodynamic repercussions. - Cerebrovascular accident of probable embolic origin. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 62-year-old woman was brought in by the UTE for two episodes of epigastralgia, cold sweats and dizziness without loss of consciousness, while sitting down after dinner, while playing Parcheesi.  History, current illness and physical examination  History: No CVRF. No cardiological history. Diverticulitis: Medical treatment until 3 days ago. No history of syncope. No other history of interest. No usual treatment.  Current illness: On arrival at the Emergency Transfer Unit, while a venous line was being cannulated, she had a new episode of dizziness with no ECG recording. During the transfer, while in decubitus position, with no apparent trigger, she had another episode of dizziness with similar characteristics and the monitor showed an asystole of 25 seconds, without loss of consciousness according to the patient and the ambulance doctor. She arrived at the Emergency Department, the Coronary Unit was notified and it was decided to admit her and implant a temporary pacemaker, which was left deactivated.  Physical examination: BP: 120/70 HR: 80 sat o2: 96%. Conscious, oriented, hydrated, nourished, normal colour, eupneic, afebrile. Head and neck: No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: good general ventilation. Abdomen: soft, depressible, non-painful, Blumberg and Murphy negative.  Complementary tests - CBC: Glucose 132 mg/dl; creatinine 0.6 mg/dl; urea 29 mg/dl; Na 141 mEq/l; K 4.4 mEq/l; Hb 13.1 g/dl; coagulation within normal limits, troponin 8.09 ngr/l; Ck 69 u/l. - Chest X-ray: No increase in cardiac silhouette, normal lung fields. - Baseline ECG: RS at 80 bpm, axis at 0o, no conduction disturbances or repolarisation. - Ambulance ECG: Asystole 25 seconds.   Clinical evolution During the night there were no new episodes of asystole, presyncope or syncope. The following morning, while the introducer was being cleaned, the nurse said to the patient, "look, here is the introducer", at which point the patient said "oh, don't tell me that", she lost consciousness and the monitor showed asystole of 15 seconds, and the pacemaker was manually activated at that moment. After questioning the patient, she reported that she had always felt dizzy when pricked with a needle. It was decided to implant a permanent pacemaker in the patient, she was discharged to the ward, and the following day when she went for a control chest X-ray in a wheelchair, the patient presented a new episode of intense dizziness, and it was found that the pacemaker electrode was correctly positioned and no failures were detected in the ECG with magnet. She was discharged. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 64-year-old man consulted the emergency department for three days of clinical symptoms of fever up to 40oC associated with polymyalgia, osteoarthralgia, cervical pain and headache.  History, current illness and physical examination  Reason for consultation: Fever Personal history: Hypertension, nephritic colic, hiatus hernia. On regular treatment with ARA II.  Present illness: 64-year-old man who consulted the emergency department for three days of clinical symptoms of fever up to 40oC associated with polymyalgia, osteoarthralgia, cervical pain and headache.  Physical examination: Conscious, alert and oriented. BP: 79/54 mmHg HR 120 bpm. Poor distal perfusion with coldness in extremities. AC: Tachycardic heart sounds, frequent extrasystoles, no murmurs. AP: Pulmonary sounds without aggregates. Abdomen: soft, depressible, no masses or megaliths. No peritoneal irritation. Osteomuscular: Arthralgias in all limb joints with no evidence of inflammation or embolic phenomena. No meningeal signs. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Complementary tests - Emergency laboratory tests: leucocytes 9100, neutrophils 88%, platelets 20,000, creatinine 4.8 mg/dL, urea 1.33 g/L, lactic acidosis. - Urinalysis: Bacteriuria and leucocytes. - Blood cultures. - Chest X-ray: Normal. - Abdominal ultrasound: Normal. - CT scan of the brain: Normal.   Clinical evolution During his stay in the Emergency Department, he evolved with a tendency to hypotension and oligoanuria which did not recover with vascular filling; with the initial diagnosis of septic shock, treatment was started with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where inotropic support was started. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which only showed thickening of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve without clear images of vegetations. The patient evolved in a torpid manner, hypotension, acute pulmonary oedema requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. A few hours after admission, and on suspicion of infective endocarditis, a transesophageal echocardiogram was completed, showing severe mitral insufficiency with a large vegetative image on the posterior leaflet of up to 44 mm in length and 7-9 mm in base on the atrial side, indicating severe mitral insufficiency suggestive of acute evolution. At this time, blood cultures showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin. The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery referral centre. During surgery, a mitral valve with severe endocardial involvement was observed in the mural leaflet that also affected the left ventricular wall, annulus and wall of the right atrium, forming an abscess in the wall and in the atrioventricular groove. The wart and the valve were resected and replaced with a mechanical prosthesis. The patient evolves in a torpid manner requiring inotropic support, IABP or, without achieving haemodynamic stability. Refractory shock and death three days after IQx.

70-year-old male, with no cardiovascular risk factors or relevant medical history. He leads an active life. He presented with an episode of dyspnoea on exertion lasting two days, denying chest pain and palpitations.  History, current illness and physical examination Physical examination revealed low-set ears, broad nasal bridge and neck, low hairline, pectus carinatum/excavatum and scoliosis. No jugular ingurgitation. Multifocal III/VI systolic murmur, of greater intensity in the sternal notch, without irradiation. Pulmonary auscultation was normal. Peripheral pulses were symmetrical. There was no oedema.  Complementary tests - Electrocardiogram: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and signs of right ventricular hypertrophy. - Echocardiogram: Despite a poor window, a very hypertrophic right ventricle was seen, with thickening of the tricuspid valve. - Transesophageal echocardiogram: This was performed and showed dilatation of the pulmonary artery, with no further data with respect to the transthoracic echocardiogram. - CT scan: Given the suspicion of pulmonary hypertension, a CT scan was performed to rule out secondary causes, the most relevant finding being an aneurysmal dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (4.3 cm) and left pulmonary artery (3.8 cm). - Cardiac MRI: Thickening of the pulmonary valve was observed, with accelerated flow, suggestive of severe pulmonary stenosis. - Catheterisation: Right catheterisation was performed and ventriculography confirmed pulmonary valve stenosis and another infundibular stenosis, with a gradient between the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle of 70 mmHg and 42% with spectral Doppler and DTI in the bordeline range in the 1st and normal in the 2nd. Minimal IT with gradient of 22 mmHg and PAPs of 30 mmHg. LV 45 mm with very discrete inferobasal hypokinesia and overall preserved EF (50-55%).  Clinical evolution Percutaneous dilatation of the pulmonary valve was performed, reducing the transvalvular gradient to 30 mmHg, leaving moderate pulmonary insufficiency; the subvalvular gradient was 60 mmHg, so he is receiving high doses of metoprolol (250 mg c/12 hours), with good tolerance, maintaining heart rate around 65-70 beats per minute.  Diagnosis Noonan syndrome. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Anomalous progression of R in right precordial leads. - Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. Slight aortic elongation. Enlarged pulmonary hilum. - CT scan: anomalous arrangement of great vessels, with pulmonary artery medial to the aorta (aortic overlap or corrected transposition?). Pulmonary cone slightly increased in size (radiological pulmonary hypertension). Mosaic pattern of pulmonary parenchyma of vascular cause. - Echocardiography: Situs solitus. Ventricular inversion. Atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance. Left ventricle of normal size and contractility. Left atrium of normal size. Right chambers of normal size and function.

However, the visual impression is of generalised hypokinesia, more marked in the apical region, determining a slight depression of the ejection fraction. No significant valvular heart disease. No evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension. No pericardial effusion. The aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta are not correctly visualised. - Coronary angiography. - Stenosis of 70% of AMD at the expense of thrombus at that level. IVUS was performed which confirmed a large amount of thrombus. - Thromboaspiration with Hunter device was successful, leaving the artery with TIMI III flow and no residual stenosis. - Coagulation study: Prothrombin time: 12.9 sec.

Clinical course Asymptomatic for chest pain on arrival at the Emergency Department, given the evolution of the ECG and the alterations in the echocardiogram, coronary angiography was requested, with the aforementioned results in complementary tests. During his hospital stay, the patient remained asymptomatic and stable at all times. A coagulation study was carried out which confirmed the existence of protein C deficiency, so on discharge oral anticoagulation with acenocoumarol was started in addition to the medical treatment indicated as secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease. Six months after discharge from the outpatient cardiology department, the patient was asymptomatic and adhered well to medical treatment. Given the incidental finding of pre-excitation in the baseline electrocardiogram during his hospital stay, conventional ergometry was performed which showed its almost complete disappearance during exercise, which, added to his asymptomatic status in this respect, indicated clinical follow-up without the introduction of other measures.  Diagnosis - Ischaemic heart disease: Iamest anterior Killip I. Middle-aged mid-segment thrombosis in the context of protein C deficiency. - Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiographic pattern. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We present the case of a 41-year-old patient who was referred to the clinic on the same day for assessment of a pathological ECG, which had been performed as part of the preoperative work-up for surgery on his right shoulder, where he was suffering from chronic pain.  History, current illness and physical examination He did not suffer from any illness, except for pain in his back and right shoulder for which he took painkillers sporadically. He practised sport regularly and was in very good physical condition, although he reported greater fatigue in recent months. The patient showed an obvious absence of several phalanges in his left hand which was attributed, in the country of his birth (he was the son of seasonal agricultural workers), to possible maternal exposure to thalidomide. He also had other musculoskeletal anomalies, and claimed to have other relatives with some minor upper limb defects. Physical examination revealed pectus excavatum and other musculoskeletal abnormalities in the upper and lower extremities. On cardiac auscultation, there was a rhythmic heartbeat at 35 bpm, and a systolic murmur with fixed splitting of the second sound. No signs of heart failure. BP 100/60. The ECG showed the presence of complete AV block. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and it was decided to place a definitive bicameral pacemaker and continue the patient's study.  Complementary tests - Transthoracic echocardiography: It had shown dilatation of the right chambers, mild tricuspid insufficiency with a PAP of 50 mmHg and preserved ventricular function. Due to pectus excavatum, it was not possible to correctly visualise the atrial septum. - Chest CT angiography: showed dilatation of the right chambers and the pulmonary cone. - Transesophageal echocardiography: it was possible to verify the existence of a 21mm ostium secundum type atrial septal defect, with left-right shunt. - Traumatologic study: It reported the presence of pectus excavatum, glenohumeral subluxation in the right shoulder, patellar subluxation of the right knee, agenesis of several phalanges of the fingers of the left hand, radioulnar synostosis in the left elbow, pes cavus and agenesis of the distal phalanx of the first toe of the right foot.  Clinical course Given the combination of musculoskeletal defects, complete AV block and ASD ostium secundum, a genetic study was requested. The family tree showed several cases of musculoskeletal defects and even some cases of sudden death. Genetic testing revealed a mutation (c.100-101insG) in the TBX5 gene, and a diagnosis of Holt Oram syndrome was made. Finally, the patient underwent surgery and the interatrial defect was closed using an autologous pericardial patch, without postoperative complications. To date, he remains asymptomatic cardiovascular.  Diagnosis Holt Oram syndrome: Various musculoskeletal alterations, Ostium Secundum atrial septal defect and complete atrioventricular block. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 65-year-old patient with a history of liver transplantation and cirrhosis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV), who came to the emergency department with swelling, oedema and pain in the right lower extremity. Background, current disease and physical examination We present the case of a 65-year-old patient with a history of liver transplantation with cirrhosis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) the previous year, smoking and no other cardiovascular risk factors who attended the emergency department for swelling, oedema and pain in the right lower limb twin region. A Doppler ultrasound was performed and a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was made. The patient was discharged with anticoagulant treatment (subcutaneous enoxaparin). The patient returned to the emergency department 2 hours after discharge with symptoms of motor aphasia and right hemiparesis suggestive of right middle cerebral artery stroke.  Complementary tests - Cerebral CAT scan: Normal. - ECG: Subepicardial lesion of 4-5 mm in inferior face with specular image in high lateral face and decrease of ST in V1-V2 of up to 4 mm compatible with posterior lesion - Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated LV, preserved LVEF, severe infero-posterior hypokinesia and we observed a redundant interatrial septum with image in right atrium compatible with persistence of Chiari network. - Urgent catheterisation: Right coronary occluded medially with an image suggestive of an abundant thrombotic component, mechanical thrombectomy was performed with a catheter, extracting several red thrombi with subsequent normalisation of flow (TIMI 3) without finding a residual lesion, so coronary embolism was suspected as the cause of the occlusion of the right coronary, no stent was placed. The left coronary artery was normal.  Clinical Evolution Once the catheterisation was performed, the patient was transferred to the Coronary Unit where he remained for two days with satisfactory evolution from the cardiological and neurological point of view. Subsequently, given the suspicion of paradoxical embolism (finding of an infero-posterior acute myocardial infarction (AMI) accompanied by a stroke in a patient with a history of recent DVT), a transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated with injection of agitated saline without observing a clear left right shunt. Given the high level of suspicion, we decided to perform a TEE which confirmed the presence of a patent foramen ovale. A CT body scan was also performed to rule out a neoplastic process as the cause of the prothrombotic state, which showed images compatible with hepatic, splenic and renal embolisms. The hypercoagulability study was normal. The patient was discharged on oral anticoagulant treatment and remained asymptomatic to date.  Diagnosis Multiple embolism (probably paradoxical) in a patient with patent foramen ovale. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
70-year-old male. History of pulmonary tuberculosis with residual left fibrothorax, several episodes of severe haemoptysis years earlier. Pulmonary auscultation showed generalised hypophonesis, greater in the left hemithorax and scattered rhonchi. No oedema.  History, current illness and physical examination 70-year-old male. CVRF: Ex-smoker of 50 packs per year, hypercholesterolemia. Mild COPD. Ischaemic stroke in 2011. Paroxysmal AF not anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding. History of pulmonary tuberculosis 30 years ago, with residual left fibrothorax. Several episodes of severe haemoptysis years ago, some with haemodynamic instability that required admission to the ICU. During one of them, during a thoracic CT scan, two heterotopic bronchial arteries were observed, originating in the left subclavian artery and draining into multiple tortuous vessels associated with an area of saccular bronchiectasis located in the left lower pulmonary lobe. Embolisation was then performed using microcoils and embo-spheres of these aberrant arteries, despite which episodes of haemoptysis persisted, so pulmonary lobectomy was decided as the best therapeutic option for the patient.  Physical examination: BP 140/75, PVY normal. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic, without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation showed generalised hypophonesis, greater in the left hemithorax and scattered rhonchi. No oedema.  Complementary tests Prior to surgery, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which showed a left ventricle of normal size and function, a slightly dilated right ventricle with good function, mild biauricular dilatation, mild MR and mild TR with moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension. A haemodynamic study and coronary angiography were requested to our hospital for surgical evaluation of the patient. Cardiac catheterisation showed moderate pulmonary hypertension with normal PCP, but coronary angiography revealed a large coronary-bronchial fistula originating in the circumflex artery and draining into multiple tortuous vessels located in the left lower pulmonary lobe.  Clinical course With the diagnostic suspicion that the coronary-bronchial fistula could be the cause of the patient's current episodes of haemoptysis, it was successfully embolised using a 6F AL 2 guide catheter (Cordis LBT, NJ, USA) and an angioplasty guide (Runthrough Hipercoat, Terumo Europe, Netherlands) to introduce a microcatheter (Progreat, Terumo Europe, Netherlands) to the most distal area of the fistula and finally release three microcoils (Cook Medical) sequentially, until angiographically demonstrating flow abolition. Surgery was postponed until clinical evolution was observed. One year after the procedure the patient remains asymptomatic, with no new episodes of haemoptysis.  Diagnosis Recurrent haemoptysis secondary to large coronary-bronchial fistula. Successful percutaneous embolisation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The 67-year-old patient, with a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia, with aortic prosthesis and pacemaker, who attended the Emergency Department for a sudden onset of right hemiparesis, dysphasia, disorientation, headache and vomiting.  History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: 67-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia; aortic prosthesis holder since 2004 and a normal functioning VDD pacemaker, with replacement 3 months ago.  Present illness: The patient consulted the Emergency Department for a sudden onset of right hemiparesis, dysphasia, disorientation, headache and vomiting. He refers to a history of influenza with fever measured by thermometry during the last few days.  Physical examination: On arrival at the ED, the patient was haemodynamically stable with blood pressure of 101/63 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm and oxygen saturation of 94% at baseline. On physical examination the patient was vigilant and alert without ophthalmoparesis or campimetric alteration due to threat. He had global dysphasia, slight deviation of the labial commissure to the left and right brachial hemiparesis 1/5, crural hemiparesis 4/5 with right extensor plantar cutaneous reflex. Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed periprosthetic aortic sounds with mitral murmur III/VI and scattered rhonchi in both lung fields. Given the diagnosis of ischaemic stroke in the left MCA territory of non-filial origin, a stroke code was ruled out as it exceeded the window period and admission was decided for aetiological study and treatment.  Complementary tests Given the clinical symptoms suggestive of cerebral ischaemia, during his stay in the Emergency Department, a cranial CT scan was requested, showing hypodensity in the left basal ganglia in relation to an acute ischaemic lesion in the middle cerebral artery territory. The study in this department was completed with an ECG, the reading of which revealed a VDD pacemaker rhythm at 77 bpm; a basic blood test including haemogram and coagulation with Hb 11.9 g/dl, leukocytes 18,300 (N 92.2%), INR 5.7, FD 610 mg/dl, troponin I 894 pg/ml, CRP 157 mg/L; and a chest X-ray showing cardiomegaly, with no images of condensation or pleural effusion. Blood cultures were also taken. On admission to the ward, in view of the laboratory findings described and the history of febrile syndrome and recent pacemaker replacement, it was decided to perform urgent transthoracic echocardiography to rule out endocarditis as the aetiological focus of the cerebral infarction. The echocardiogram showed dilatation of the left atrium with preserved FEV1 without alterations in contractility and normal mitral valve. There was a dysfunctional aortic prosthesis with high gradients (peak gradient 60 mmHg, mean 35 mmHg). The peak gradient in the previous control was 30 mmHg. There is an image compatible with endocardial vegetation in its posterior disc, with thrombus density, pedunculated and sessile. Moderate pulmonary hypertension and mild tricuspid insufficiency, which had already been reported in previous studies, were described. The echocardiographic finding was confirmed within 24 hours by transesophageal echocardiography, which showed a large vegetation of about 20 mm in the outflow tract and a large periaortic abscess open to the bloodstream extending to the interatrial septum. The appearance of the mitral valve and left ventricular function are normal. At that time, preliminary blood culture results were received showing growth of Gram-positive cocci in clusters. The definitive result was S. epidermidis.  Clinical course This is a 67-year-old patient with AHT, DM, aortic prosthesis and VDD pacemaker who was admitted for an abrupt onset of language disorder and right hemiparesis related to ischemic stroke in CMI territory, with an INR on admission of 5.7. On admission, given the presence of leukocytosis and elevated CRP supporting the suspicion of endocarditis, an emergency transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed endocardial vegetation on the aortic valve, and antibiotic treatment was started with vancomycin, gentamincin and rifampicin after extraction of blood cultures. The patient had undergone a pacemaker replacement three months ago and for the last week had been experiencing general malaise, profuse sweating with fever peaks of up to 39oC, which he related to a case of influenza. A transesophageal echocardiogram was completed, confirming vegetation and open periaortic abscess, and the Cardiac Surgery Department of the referral hospital (H. Clínico Universitario de Valladolid) was contacted for transfer. During his stay in our hospital, the neurological evolution was slightly favourable with improvement of the right brachio-crural motor deficit 4/5, with persistent central facial, hemianopsia due to threat and global dysphasia. There were no signs of heart failure or arrhythmias.  Diagnosis Given the findings described above, the final diagnosis was late prosthetic endocarditis due to Staphylococcus epid. complicated with ischaemic stroke and periaortic abscess. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
26-year-old male, who attended his point of continuous care in the early hours of the morning due to vomiting and agitation, accompanied by pain in the left rib cage with coughing since the middle of the night.  History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: Male, 26 years old. Allergy to penicillin. Previous history of drug intoxication. Usual treatment: No. Present illness: This is a 26-year-old male, who came to his point of continuous care in the early hours of the morning with vomiting and agitation, accompanied by pain in the left rib cage with cough since the middle of the night (4-5 am). Given the patient's condition, it was decided to transfer him to his regional referral hospital. He denied the use of toxic substances and cocaine. Physical examination: BP 92/62 mmHg HR 71 bpm. Conscious, agitated, anxiety, pallor, sweating. Signs of poor peripheral perfusion. Cardiac auscultation showed no murmurs or evidence of heart failure.  Complementary tests - CBC: Haemogram: Leukocytes: 27,900/ml (N 89%; L 5.6%), Hb 17.3 g/dl, Hct 48.9%, platelets 400,000 /ml. Basic biochemistry: Glucose 187 mg/dl; urea 30 mg/dl; creatinine 1.2 mg/dl; Na 143 meq/l, K 3.7 meq/l. Myocardial damage markers: TpI 0.03. Coagulation: PT 99; aPTT 23.3. - Urine toxicity: cocaine, benzodiazepines and cannabinoid products. - Chest X-ray: No acute pleuropulmonary pathology. - Initial electrocardiogram: Sinus rhythm 60 bpm. ST-segment elevation > 2 mm in the anterolateral side. - Electrocardiogram 2: Sinus rhythm 80 bpm. In view of the clinical findings (chest pain, signs of poor peripheral perfusion; preshock K status) and electrocardiographic findings (AMI with ST-segment elevation) and given that the patient was in a regional hospital with no possibility of early access to a centre with primary angioplasty, it was decided to perform thrombolysis with 8000 IU of metalyse. However, after thirty minutes there were no clinical or electrocardiographic criteria for reperfusion, so it was decided to transfer the patient to a reference centre for primary PTCA. At the start of the transfer, the patient presented good saturation and data of capillary hypoperfusion with a capillary refill time > 2 seconds. During the transfer he presented episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and slow ventricular tachycardia. After 20 minutes he presented with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and advanced CPR manoeuvres were initiated. After 30 minutes, asystole was observed and advanced CPR manoeuvres were continued. He arrived at the haemodynamics room of our centre in asystole, an urgent echocardiogram was performed which showed no evidence of cardiac rupture and after 50 minutes of unsuccessful advanced CPR, the patient died.  Diagnosis - Acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation due to cocaine use. - Exitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
History, current illness and physical examination A 12-year-old boy was admitted to the PICU after being transferred by ambulance for cardio-respiratory arrest at home. He presented with a 12-hour history of odynophagia with a fever of 38°C maximum. After administering antipyretic medication, the mother reported noticing pathological respiratory sounds and loss of consciousness, so she called 112. On arrival of the basic support ambulance, an ICD was connected, confirming ventricular fibrillation, and defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were performed, achieving an organised rhythm with a pulse after 4 minutes (after two shocks of 360 J). The medicalised ambulance arrived home, and the patient was intubated, sedated and transferred. Estimated time of cardiac arrest (from call to 112 to rhythm with pulse): 16 minutes. Background history: normal pregnancy and delivery. Wheezy bronchitis in infancy. No previous admissions. Vaccination according to schedule. No known allergies. Pending outpatient consultation in paediatric cardiology due to a murmur diagnosed by her paediatrician a month ago. Family history with uncle, grandfather and paternal cousin with acquired cardiac pathology.  Physical examination showed an estimated weight of 45 kg. HR: 100 bpm, RR: 20 rpm, BP. 112/57, Sat. 02 100% (FiO2 of 0.3). Sedated, connected to mechanical ventilation. Skin pallor. No oedema. No petechiae. ACP: Good bilateral air entry. Rhythmic heart tones. Abdomen: Soft and depressible, no masses or megaliths.  Complementary tests - ECG: Growth of left cavities and marked decrease of ST (especially in I, II, aVR and left precordial. QTC: 400ms. - Enzymatic peak: CPK: 1,722, CKMB: 42.7. Troponin T: 360.8, ProBNP: 3,788. - Echocardiography: Situs solitus, AV-VA concordance. AIS and IVS intact. Slight dilatation of the left ventricle (DTD 50 mm) with good systolic function (EF 55-60). Normofunctioning valves. Normal aorta and pulmonary artery. No pericardial effusion. Dilated right coronary artery of 6 mm. Left coronary artery is not observed in its normal origin. Flow to pulmonary artery mainly systolic (although it seems continuous), probably due to anomalous origin of the left coronary artery. - Angio CT coronary arteries: Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery with passage of contrast from the left coronary artery to the pulmonary artery. Dilated right coronary artery with origin in right coronary sinus with collateral circulation to the left coronary artery.  Clinical evolution On admission, monitoring, connection to mechanical ventilation, hypothermia and serum therapy were started. Respiratory system was connected to conventional mechanical ventilation with adequate oxygenation. Respiratory deterioration from the 4th day of admission with worsening oxygenation and pneumonic condensation. Subsequent progressive improvement with slow withdrawal of FiO2 and PEEP. Haemodynamically on admission, continuous dopamine perfusion was started up to 20 mcg/kg/min for TAM 70. Tendency to bradycardia during hypothermia with QTc lengthening to 0.55, which normalised after withdrawal. There were no arrhythmias during the entire admission. Neurological: On admission, he was connected to continuous perfusion of deep sedoanalgesia with midazolam and fentanyl. Therapeutic hypothermia protocol was applied, maintaining a core temperature of 33-34°C for 48 hours. Continuous monitoring with amplitude-integrated EEG was maintained without the appearance of seizure episodes and with stable and symmetrical cerebral oximetry. Rewarming according to protocol without complications. Progressive withdrawal of sedoanalgesia with the appearance of coordinated spontaneous mobility without focality. Renal/Hydrometabolic: Maintained throughout admission with adequate diuresis, requiring occasional isolated doses of furosemide for adequate balances. Normal renal function. In view of the echocardiogram findings, a coronary CAT scan was performed which confirmed an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery in the pulmonary artery. With these data, the patient was referred to our paediatric cardiac surgery referral centre where cardiac catheterisation was performed with the same findings as the coronary CT scan. The patient underwent reimplantation of the left coronary artery in the aorta without significant complications.  Diagnosis - Cardio-respiratory arrest due to resuscitated ventricular fibrillation. - ALCAPA syndrome (anomalous origin of left coronary artery in pulmonary artery). - Preserved left ventricular function. - Reimplantation of left coronary artery in aorta. - Nosocomial pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The patient was a 70-year-old male with the aforementioned personal history who, while at rest, presented with severe retrosternal chest pain with oppressive characteristics, radiating to the left upper limb and accompanied by intense vegetative cramping. The emergency department performed an electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in DI, AVL, V2-V3 and ST-segment depression in DII, DIII and AVF. He was given 300 mg of ASA and 600 mg of clopidrogrel plus nitroglycerine and intravenous morphine chloride. He arrived at the Haemodynamics Unit, 4,000 IU of intravenous sodium heparin was administered and primary PTCA was performed on the culprit lesion of the anterior descending artery at the level of the proximal segment two hours after the onset of symptoms. He was subsequently admitted to the ICU where he remained for 48 hours, remaining haemodynamically stable with no arrhythmic events or signs of heart failure. Subsequently admitted to the Cardiology ward, the physical examination on admission showed the patient to be asymptomatic with an adequate level of consciousness, oriented and cooperative, BP 110/70 mmhg, HR 70 bpm. He was afebrile, eupneic, tolerated decubitus, on cardiopulmonary auscultation rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs or pericardial friction, vesicular murmur present bilaterally with minimal crackles in the lung bases, soft abdomen, not distended, hydroaerial sounds present, no peripheral oedema, no neurological deficit. From the seventh day of admission, she presented with chest pain that increased with deep inspiration and changes in posture without new variations in the ECG, accompanied by palpitations, with paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (120-140 bpm) associated with daily febrile peaks (38-40 °C) without infectious symptoms at respiratory, urinary and abdominal levels. Samples were taken for serial blood and urine cultures, which were repeatedly negative. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a non-dilated LV with akinesia in anteroseptal and apical segments, LVEF 35% and circumferential pericardial effusion with moderate fibrin (15 mm) producing partial collapse of the RV in end-diastole with respiratory variations in tricuspid and transmitral Doppler velocity. From the analytical point of view, there was discrete leukocytosis, neutrophilia, ESR and elevated CRP.    Complementary tests - ECG: Sinus rhythm at 88 bpm. IAH. PR 200 ms. ST elevation of 2-3 mm in DI and AVL, 3-4 mm in V2-V3 with sharp T wave and specular decrease in the inferior leads - CBC: haemoglobin 15.2 g/dl, MCV 85 fl, leukocytes 11,400, neutrophils 82%, lymphocytes 12%, eosinophils 0.5%, platelets 160,000.

There is partial collapse of the RV in end-diastole in expiration and >25% reduction of the mitral E wave in inspiration and >50% reduction of the tricuspid E wave in expiration. Dilated inferior vena cava (29 mm), with little inspiratory reduction. LA not dilated. Normal mitral valve. Normal aortic valve. Non-dilated LV (EDV: 83 ml), without hypertrophy. Inferolateral wall normokinesia, apical and septal akinesia and hypokinesia of the rest. EF 35%. Normal right ventricle. Tricuspid valve without insufficiency. - Cardiac catheterisation: TCI without significant angiographic lesions. ADA: Atheromatous vessel. Thrombotic obstruction at proximal segment level, with TIMI 0 initial flow. Non-dominant ACx: Atheromatous and calcified vessel. Significant disease at the distal segment of the main marginal: Bifurcated lesion with distal beds of small calibre, non-diseased. Chronic occlusion of the middle segment. Distal beds of good calibre and development, not diseased, visualised through the right coronary artery. Dominant RCA: vessel of good calibre and development, with parietal irregularities, without significant angiographic lesions. Primary PTCA on the culprit lesion of the proximal LAD thromboaspiration and direct implantation of conventional stent. Good initial angiographic result, with final TIMI 3 flow. Good distal vessel, not diseased.  Clinical evolution Given these findings, the differential diagnosis of the origin of the fever was considered; firstly in the context of Dressler's syndrome and less likely an infectious aetiology; treatment was started with 500 mg of ASA every 6 hours, 0.5 mg of colchicine every 24 hours and in conjunction with the Infectious Diseases Unit it was decided to start empirical antibiotic therapy with 400 mg of teicoplanin every 12 hours until the results of the blood cultures extracted were obtained. The initial evolution was favourable with disappearance of fever during the next 48 hours, with evident improvement in the patient's general condition and due to the absence of microbiological isolation in the blood cultures, antibiotic therapy was suspended after 72 hours. However, in the following days the patient's general condition worsened again with recurrence of fever and the control echocardiography showed an increase in the amount of pericardial effusion (36 mm at lateral level of the RV, 18 mm at apical level of the LV and 37 mm at subcostal level); for this reason it was decided to start oral corticosteroids at a dose of 60 mg of prednisone every 24 hours. In the following days the clinical evolution was favourable with disappearance of fever, progressive improvement of general condition and gradual decrease of inflammatory markers, echocardiography at 2 weeks showed a significant decrease in the amount of pericardial fluid. Finally, the patient was discharged home, asymptomatic and in acceptable functional class with a tapering corticosteroid regimen  Diagnosis - STEMI anterior Killip I, underwent primary PCI and conventional stent implantation (x2) in the proximal segment of the LAD. Severely depressed LVEF. - Coronary artery disease in mid-segment of ACx and distal segment of non-revascularised main marginal. - Post-MI pericarditis and circumferential pericardial effusion in the context of Dressler's syndrome. - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A 17-year-old federated sportsman who consulted the Emergency Department on up to six occasions for episodes of fainting, leading to loss of consciousness in the middle of a sporting competition, over the last two months.  History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: 17-year-old male. Federated sportsman. No known drug allergies. No cardiovascular risk factors. No toxic habits. No personal or family history of heart disease. Present illness: A 17-year-old federated sportsman who consulted the Emergency Department on up to 6 occasions for episodes of fainting, leading to loss of consciousness in the middle of a sporting competition, over the last two months. Given the presence of repeated syncopes related to exercise, the patient was admitted to Cardiology for screening for a cardiac cause. He also reported other episodes of dizziness and syncope with a vaso-vagal profile (syncope preceded by abdominal discomfort, nausea and dizziness lasting seconds). As additional symptoms, she reported occasional headache that increased with coughing and exertion. She did not report dyspnoea, chest pain or palpitations. Given the normality of the initial complementary tests performed (ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram, ECG monitoring and ergometry), the patient was discharged with the diagnosis of syncope of probable neuromediated origin, and it was recommended that the maximum heart rate should not be exceeded during physical exertion. Two weeks later, he was admitted again after presenting three syncopal episodes, one of them just after performing an exercise stress test, where he reached 197 bpm. It is reported that at the end of the test, once the recovery period was over and the ECG electrodes had been disconnected, he presented syncope with very severe hypotension and without giving time for electrocardiographic monitoring. The second episode occurred after playing a football match preceded by abdominal discomfort, and finally the third episode occurred after a shower, taking about 4 minutes to recover, according to the family. To complete the study, a cardiac MRI was performed to rule out arrhythmogenic dysplasia, a flecainide test to simulate a Brugada type II ECG pattern, a tilt table test and a neurological study given the prolonged duration of the last episode. The cardiac MRI was reported as normal, as well as the flecainide test and the electroencephalogram.  Neurology was consulted and a cranial MRI was requested, which gave the diagnosis as the cerebellar tonsils were found to be descended with rectification of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The patient was discharged with the diagnosis of Chiari malformation type I.  Physical examination: BP 90/50. HR 60lpm. Conscious and oriented. Normohydrated and normoperfused. Eupneic at rest. ACR: rhythmic tones without audible murmurs. VCM without superimposed noises. Abdomen: soft, depressible, without masses or megaliths. Not painful on palpation. Lower extremities with preserved and symmetrical pulses.  Complementary tests - Complementary examination. - ECG: Sinus rhythm at 75 bpm and incomplete right bundle branch block with J point elevation in right precordial leads and normal QTc interval. - Chest X-ray: Cardiothoracic index within normal limits. No congestive signs. - Echocardiogram: Left ventricle not dilated or hypertrophic, with global and segmental systolic function within normal limits. Left atrium not dilated. Normal right chambers. Normal left ventricular filling pattern. No valvular or pericardial abnormalities. Normal aortic root and ascending aorta. Atrial septum and interventricular septum intact. No gradient in descending aorta. - Ergometry: Stopped due to twin contracture, at 78% of submaximal heart rate. No clinical or electrical events of interest were observed. - Flecainide test: Stopped after 7 minutes of infusion (2/3 dose of the drug) as the patient felt dizziness and without any electrocardiographic alteration suspicious of Brugada syndrome. - Cardiac MRI: non-dilated right ventricle, with a free wall of normal thickness, without irregularities or images of pseudoaneurysm. There was no fatty infiltration of the wall. There was no RV dysfunction, with volumes and EF within normal limits. - Electroencephalogram: baseline cerebral bioelectrical activity was normal. No focal or generalised paroxysmal abnormalities were observed. - Cerebral MRI: Cerebellar tonsil descent with rectification of the floor of the fourth ventricle. No signs of hydrocephalus or intracerebral lesions were observed. The diagnosis of Arnold-Chiari is confirmed.  Clinical evolution The patient was referred to neurosurgery and underwent a suboccipital craniectomy and laminectomy of C1. The patient has progressively resumed sporting activity without new syncopal episodes.

History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: No known allergies. Smoker of 1 pack a day. No alcohol or other drugs. High blood pressure, discontinued pharmacological treatment. Mild dyslipidaemia on dietary treatment. Anxiety-depressive syndrome. Episodes of anxiety for 8 years, consisting of chest pains, palpitations, sweating and paleness. She was assessed by Cardiology for these episodes, with no significant findings. She was subsequently assessed by psychiatry a year ago. Paroxetine was prescribed, and the episodes, which were very frequent (almost daily), disappeared. However, in the week prior to the cardiac arrest that led to her admission, she had again presented pictures of central thoracic pain, with significant vegative crusade without syncope or palpitations, lasting a few minutes and spontaneous recovery. No family history of heart disease. Usual treatment: paroxetine. Current episode: 49-year-old female patient who, while teaching (she is a secondary school teacher), presented with dizziness and general malaise, followed by loss of consciousness. According to her co-worker, they initially felt for a pulse, noting a very high heart rate, and then stopped feeling a pulse. The school staff started basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres for about 20 minutes, which was the time it took for the SAMU to arrive. On arrival, the SAMU monitored the patient and found ventricular fibrillation on the monitor and administered a 200 J shock, leaving the patient in a rhythm that appeared to be atrial fibrillation (no clear atrial mechanism, narrow QRS, HR 99-100 bpm). She was intubated after sedation-relaxation with 30 mg midazolam and 10 mg norcuronium. The patient was transferred to the hospital and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  Physical examination: Blood pressure: 112/62 mmHg, HR: 92 beats/min. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs or friction rubs. Pulmonary auscultation (intubated): No extra sounds. Abdomen: soft and depressible, no masses or megaliths palpable. Lower limbs: No oedema. Peripheral pulses preserved and symmetrical.  Complementary tests - ECG: Sinus rhythm at 90 bpm. Axis at 0o. NO alterations in atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction. Adequate progression of R in precordial leads. No repolarisation alterations. - Echocardiogram: Left ventricle of preserved size and function, without segmental alterations of contractility and with pseudonormal filling pattern (E>A that reverses with Valsalva). Absence of significant valvulopathies. RV of preserved size and function. Minimal tricuspid insufficiency that allowed estimating a PsAP of 35 mmHg. NO signs of increased central venous pressure. - Chest X-ray: Bibasal interstitial pattern. Right hilum thickening. - Cranial CT: No haematic collections or space-occupying lesions in cerebellar parenchyma or brainstem. Ventricular system and sulci without alterations. Midline structures centred. - Laboratory tests: Biochemistry: Glucose 289 mg/dl, creatinine 0.69 mg/dl, CRP 3.1 mg/L, Na 140 mEq/l, K 4.9 mEq/l, CK 246 to 495 U/l, ultrasensitive troponin T: 130 to 1509 ng/l. Haemogram Hb 14.6 g/dl, haematocrit 44.8%, leucocytes 10,600, neutrophils 55.5%, platelets 307,000. - Haemostasis: INR 1. - Urine toxicity: Positive for benzodiazepines.  Clinical course After a cranial CT scan, the patient was connected to invasive mechanical ventilation and a right subclavian central line was placed. Initially the patient had mydriatic pupils, but reactive to light, under the effects of sedorelaxation administered by the SAMU. Sedoanalgesia was started with propofol and remifentanil, and hypothermia for 24 hours. Echocardiography ruled out segmental contractility alterations and showed a normal right ventricle. The ECG showed no signs of acute ischaemia, no signs of pre-excitation, no QT lengthening, and no changes suggestive of Brugada. Cranial CT ruled out brain lesions justifying the cardiac arrest. Blood tests showed no electrolyte abnormalities. Amiodarone infusion was started, but had to be suspended 24 hours after the start of administration due to the ECG showing QT prolongation. The day after his admission (with normal QT corrected) he presented episodes of Torsades de pointes, which led to ventricular fibrillation, for which reason lidocaine perfusion was started for 48 hours. The ECG prior to the ventricular arrhythmia showed signs suggestive of infero-posterior and lateral subepicardial lesions (ST segment elevation >4mm II, III, aVF, V5 and V6 with mirror image V1-V2). Coronary angiography showed non-significant lesions in the anterior descending artery, very spastic, improving with intracoronary nitroglycerine; 70% stenosis in the middle segment of the right posterolateral branch, with good distal flow. The study was completed with cardiac MRI which ruled out cardiomyopathy. Given the suspicion of sustained vasospasm causing myocardial ischaemia and ventricular arrhythmias, calcium antagonists were prescribed; and due to the coronary lesions, antiplatelet therapy was started (initially clopidogrel and adiro), which after an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (self-limited melena) was maintained only with clopidogrel. Since then, no new ventricular arrhythmias were recorded on continuous ECG monitoring. The patient remained haemodynamically stable throughout the admission, being extubated and with progressive improvement of her neurological situation, being completely oriented, without any residual focality and presenting only a certain degree of anterograde amnesia, with difficulty in retaining the events following the cardiac arrest. Despite the absence of new arrhythmic episodes after vasodilator treatment, prior to discharge it was decided to implant a bicameral ICD, which took place without incident. She was reviewed in the outpatient clinic 3 months after discharge without any new episodes of chest pain or syncope. No sustained ventricular arrhythmias were recorded during device monitoring.

Glycosylated haemoglobin A1c 5.0%.  Clinical evolution During his stay in the bedridden area, he again presented a new episode of chest pain which coincided with the presence of multiple ventricular extrasystoles on cardiac monitoring. It was decided to discuss this with Cardiology due to the suspicion of haemodynamic angina. The monitor showed episodes of sinus bradycardia around 46 bpm, ventricular bigeminy and several episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, with a change in the electrical axis with respect to the baseline ECG and with various morphologies. In one of the tracings the tachycardia is monomorphic, although not fully rhythmic. In another tracing it shows two morphologies (due to the change of the electrical axis between the complexes, it appears to be a bidirectional tachycardia). The estimated heart rate during the tachycardias (we do not have a 12-lead ECG at any time) is around 140-180 bpm. After admission to cardiology, the patient remained asymptomatic, with no new arrhythmic events on monitoring. Given the clinical presentation of chest pain at rest, with ventricular tachycardia on monitoring, in a patient without enzyme elevation and with a normal baseline ECG, it was decided to screen for the different causes that could be related to the appearance of the arrhythmia. Psychiatry was consulted for a joint review of the side effects of agomelatine, a melatoninergic agonist (MT1 and MT2 receptors) and a serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonist. There were no data linking this drug to arrhythmic events or prolongation of the QT interval, despite which it was decided to withdraw it. An echocardiogram was performed, which showed no structural heart disease. As a test for anatomical assessment of the coronary arteries, a CT scan of the coronary arteries showed significant stenosis in the middle portion of the anterior descending artery. This finding led to coronary angiography which confirmed the lesion, which was treated by direct conventional stent implantation. Good clinical evolution during admission, with no new episodes of chest pain or ventricular extrasystoles on the monitor. Regular blood tests showed dyslipidaemia. She was discharged with statin, double antiplatelet therapy, ACE inhibitors and hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. The tendency to low heart rate did not allow the introduction of beta-blockers. She was assessed in outpatient consultations 4 months after discharge, with a holter without alterations and asymptomatic.

Clinical history and current disease 53-year-old patient with a history of dyspnoea on exertion of 6-12 months of evolution, poor window in previous echocardiogram. She came for a new echocardiogram after losing weight due to diet. No chest pain or syncope. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. Metrorrhagia with uterine curettage in 2004. She was assessed in the Internal Medicine outpatient department in 2004 for severe anaemia secondary to the above, and a colonoscopy was also performed for rectorrhagia with the finding of internal haemorrhoids. Chronic HBsAg carrier followed up in Preventive Medicine. Admitted in 2009 for pneumonia. Previous medication: ibuprofen 600 mg, spironolactone 25/hydrochlorothiazide 15 mg, metoprolol 50 mg, ramipril 5 mg.  Additional tests - CBC: white blood cells 6,820, red blood cells 4.49, haemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 38.8, mean corpuscular volume 86.4, mean corpuscular haemoglobin 29.7, platelets 227000, INR 1.01, fibrinogen 360, glucose 94, urea 47, creatinine 0.92, sodium 142, potassium 4.8, estimated glomerular filtration rate >60, glomerular filtration rate EPI 71. - Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 53 bpm with no other alterations of interest. No changes suggestive of ischaemia, cavity enlargement (perhaps LA enlargement) or conduction disturbances. - Chest X-ray: mild cardiomegaly with no radiological signs of heart failure. - Echocardiogram: LV not dilated or hypertrophic. Preserved systolic function. Mild aortic insufficiency with no gradient across it. Large mass (58x42 mm) in the left atrium with no visible pedicle or Doppler flow inside it, which protrudes minimally into the left ventricle, causing mild mitral insufficiency and moderate mitral obstruction flow. Mild TR with estimated PSP of 60-65.  Clinical evolution In view of the echocardiogram findings, the patient was transferred to the referral hospital where the evaluation was completed with coronary angiography showing coronary arteries with right dominance and no significant angiographic lesions and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showing a mass in the left atrium (62x46x40 mm) with a pedicle originating in the interatrial septum, the signal was intermediate in T1-weighted sequences, hyperintense in T2-weighted sequences and with central enhancement in the late phases of the dynamic study with gadolinium compatible with myxoma that prolapses through the mitral annulus during diastole. It was decided to perform elective surgery by transseptal access, myxoma implant was found in the septum-ceptum of the left atrium and complete resection of myxoma was performed, closing the septum with an autologous pericardium patch. During the postoperative period, an episode of atrial flutter with variable conduction and good ventricular response that did not reverse despite treatment with amiodarone. At the time of discharge the patient presented atrial flutter at 60 bpm, continuing treatment with v.o. amiodarone until the review date.  Diagnosis - Arterial hypertension - Obesity - Mass in the left atrium, probably myxoma |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Medical history and current illness 49-year-old woman with a history of chronic Chagas disease, pacemaker wearer for 35 years, not taking any medication. Diabetes (-), hypertension (-). Surgeries: 3 electrode changes (the last one 9 years ago).  Physical examination: BP 110/65 HR 70 bpm, weight 62 kg, height 1.65m. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, mild systolic murmur +/+6 in mitral focus, peak shock between 4th and 5th EII. Pulmonary auscultation: MV without added noises. Functional Class I according to NYHA. The patient reported frequent dizziness 2 weeks ago and even presented syncope when she was sitting and talking with her family at home, which is why she decided to consult the doctor. She reports that the pacemaker was implanted when she was 14 years old and she never changed the generator as it was a pacemaker with a battery based on nuclear energy (plutonium) that was donated to her in 1974. The surgeries he has undergone to date have been electrode replacements, and there is no clinical history to indicate the reason for the change.  Complementary tests - Blood tests: haemoglobin 13 g/dl, leucocytes 6,443, platelets 254,000, glucose 88, creatinine 1.1, Na 142, K:4.0. - ECG: sinus, with single-chamber pacemaker rhythm, unipolar pacing in ventricle FC 70 bpm, without VA conduction. - Chest X-ray: cardiac area with slight enlargement, 2 abandoned endocardial electrodes and 1 epicardial electrode connected to a generator with a plutonium tablet inside. - Echocardiogram: EF 59%, LVED 57 mm, LA: 45 mm, IV septum 10 mm. Mild hypokinesia inferior wall, no thrombus, no pericardial effusion. Holter 24 hours. VVI PM rhythm 70 bpm isolated polymorphic infrequent PVCs, periods of loss of ventricular command generating asystole between 5 and 7 seconds in wakefulness and at night (the spicule is not recorded during loss of capture).  Clinical evolution As no programmer was available for this model of pacemaker, it was decided to perform a surgical procedure to evaluate the integrity of the pacing system (the patient requested that if it was a case of electrode failure, the same pacemaker should be kept, as she has had it almost all her life and knows that it has unlimited energy). During the surgical procedure, when the generator was removed from the pocket, the connector was observed to be damaged and making contact with the electrode with silicone material that was placed in the previous surgery, resulting in intermittent contact 9 years after surgery. The patient received a new St. Jude Zephyr SR pacing system programmed VVIR 70 bpm, epicardial as she was unable to have access via the venous route. She was discharged within 48 hours and remained asymptomatic for approximately 12 months.  Diagnosis Capture failure due to intermittent outflow blockage. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical history and current illness A 73-year-old man was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department for a new febrile syndrome of 4 days' duration, with no clear focal symptoms and a physical examination with no significant findings. No known drug allergies. Ex-smoker. High blood pressure under pharmacological treatment. Operated in 2008 on right femoropopliteal bypass with thrombosis of the bypass one year later and self-limited febrile syndrome in relation to the thrombosis. Iron deficiency anaemia and removal of several colonic polyps in 2009. Usual treatment: amlodipine, lisinopril/HCTZ, clopidogrel, ranitidine, haemovas. ECG on admission: sinus rhythm at 45 bpm, PR 260 msec, HBAI, BCRDHH, negative T waves in III and aVF. Chest X-ray on admission: no alterations. Blood cultures were taken from the emergency department, treatment with augmentin iv was prescribed and the patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department. During his stay on the ward, after infusion of a dose of augmentin iv, the patient reported intense itching all over the body with the appearance of exanthematous skin lesions, arterial hypotension, precordial pressure and episode of syncope on getting out of bed with spontaneous recovery in a few seconds. A new ECG was performed at that time which showed complete AVB with ST elevation of 4mm in the inferior face and specular decrease in I, aVL and V1-V4. Treatment was started with iv corticoids + iv polaramine + serotherapy, which improved the AT and the allergic symptoms. Following this clinical improvement, the ECG was repeated and the aforementioned alterations disappeared, returning to an ECG similar to that on admission. Given the ECG alterations and the presence of chest pain, the patient was transferred to the Cardiology Department.  Complementary tests - Myocardial damage marker curve: negative. - Cardiac catheterisation: shows coronary arteries without significant lesions and ectasia of CD and middle DA. - Holter ECG: stable RS with low mean HR. No VE. No significant pauses. - TT echocardiography: LV slightly dilated with slightly increased wall thickness and preserved global and segmental systolic function. Diastolic pattern of elongated relaxation. Sclerosed MV with mild MR. Aortic valve without alterations. LA slightly dilated. RV not dilated, without dysfunction. Mild TR with RV-AD gradient of 30 mmHg and estimated PSAP of 40 mmHg. No pericardial effusion.  Clinical evolution Once the allergic reaction was overcome, the patient remained asymptomatic and did not present any further episodes of chest pain. Following the results of these complementary tests, the picture was interpreted as right coronary artery vasospasm secondary to anaphylaxis due to the infusion of augmentin iv, causing what is known as allergic angina or Kounis syndrome. The patient was sent to the Allergy Service and was found to be allergic to penicillin G, penicillin V, ampicillin and amoxicillin. The patient evolved favourably and was discharged.    Diagnosis - Allergic angina-Kounis disease - Coronary vasospasm secondary to anaphylaxis - Anaphylactic reaction secondary to amoxicillin-clavulanate infusion |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical history and current illness A 67-year-old man consulted for a clinical picture of approximately two months of episodes of self-limited palpitations lasting seconds, which started and ended spontaneously, in several episodes during the day, with a greater predominance at rest. Reason for consultation: tiredness and palpitations. Personal history: no relevant medical history. Smoker of one or two cigarettes a week. Family history: sudden death of his paternal grandfather at the age of forty, his father died at the age of 58 during post-operative throat surgery for an unclear cause. She does not take any regular pharmacological treatment.  Present illness: a 67-year-old man consulted for a clinical picture of approximately two months of episodes of self-limited palpitations lasting seconds, which begin and end spontaneously, in several episodes during the day, with a greater predominance at rest. At the same time of evolution he presents deterioration of his functional class with dyspnoea on moderate exertion. She denies chest pain or syncopal episodes.    Complementary tests - Blood tests: normal haemogram and biochemistry. - ECG: sinus, ventricular extrasystoles with LBBB morphology and inferior axis (positive QRS DII, III aVF and negative QRS aVL). Late depolarisation wave in V1. - Holter ECG/24 hours: sinus rhythm. Isolated supraventricular extrasystoles without significant association. Frequent ventricular extrasystoles with several doublets, phases of bigeminy and episode of NSVT. Tendency to nocturnal sinus bradycardia. No significant pauses. N. Ventricular extrasystoles 8572/24 hours. - TT echocardiogram: LVEF: 59%, LVEDD 54 mm, LA 54 mm, IVS 11 mm, right ventricle in M mode in long axis: 36 mm. Saccular images on free wall with slightly decreased systolic function. No valvular heart disease. No pericardial effusion. - Cardiac MRI: functional examination is performed using ECO T2 gradient CINE sequences with cardiac synchronisation. Performed after contrast administration. Late enhancement examination: left atrial dilatation. Left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophied with preserved LVEF 66%. Dilated right ventricle IVTD 121 ml/m2, IVTS 67 ml/m2 with moderate-severe depression of RV systolic function EF 33%. Akinetic aneurysmal sacculations in the right ventricular free wall.  Clinical course Treatment with sotalol was started with adequate tolerance and reduction of symptoms. An exercise test was performed under pharmacological treatment in which he remained asymptomatic, doubling the DP. Ventricular extrasystoles were observed at rest, which disappeared on exertion. No other arrhythmias were observed. The patient continued to be monitored in outpatient consultations and was found to be asymptomatic and with improvement in his functional class.  Diagnosis Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Clinical history and current illness A 48-year-old man consulted for recurrent presyncopal symptoms related to exertion and subsequent recovery 'ad integrum' within a few seconds. He reported slight dyspnoea without accompanying chest pain or palpitations. In the previous months he had visited the emergency department on several occasions for episodes of fever, dyspnoea and dizziness and was discharged with a diagnosis of respiratory infection. His personal history included: chronic alcoholism, smoker with clinical criteria for COPD, hypertension on treatment with candesartan, deep vein thrombosis in the right lower limb in 2009 on treatment with acenocoumarol since then.  Physical examination: good general condition, clinical and haemodynamic stability with adequate blood pressure control, maintaining O2 saturation of around 96% with O2 supply in nasal goggles at 2 bpm. Obesity. Eupneic at rest and during conversation, tolerating decubitus adequately. Normal neurological examination. Heart rhythmic, slightly tachycardic, without murmurs or extratonos. Generalised decrease in vesicular murmur with scattered wheezing in both lung fields. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful on palpation and without visceromegaly. Slight oedema in both lower limbs, in the absence of signs of deep vein thrombosis.    Complementary tests - Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly with thickened pulmonary hilarity with a vascular appearance. - Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 95 spm. Pulmonary P wave. Asymmetric negative T wave in III, aVF and from V1 to V4. - Haemogram: haemoglobin 16.6 g/dL, haematocrit 50.4%, MCV 99.5 fL. Rest of the study normal. - Coagulation: INR 2.85, PT 34.66 ́ ́, APTT 53.78 ́ ́ ́. - Biochemistry: creatinine 1.4 mg/dl, urea 57 mg/dl. Minimal mobilisation of ultrasensitive troponin T 88.78 ng/l with normal total CPK. Venous blood gas: pH 7.356, pCO2 45 mmHg, pO2 50 mmHg, EB -2 mEq/l. Rest normal. - Urine sediment: protein 320.8 mg/dl. Abundant hyaline cylinders.   Clinical evolution Given the presence of minimal mobilisation of cardiac ferments in the analytical study and the electrocardiographic findings, the Chest Pain Unit was contacted and it was decided to perform urgent echocardiography, with the following results: non-dilated left ventricle with moderate concentric hypertrophy and preserved systolic function; dilated right ventricle with marked free wall hypokinesia with flattening of the interventricular septum and moderate systolic dysfunction; slightly dilated inferior vena cava with inspiratory collapse greater than 50%; absence of pericardial effusion. Chest CT angiography showed a partial repletion defect in the right pulmonary artery that most significantly affected the segmental artery of the right upper lobe, preserving its distal flow; emphysematous pattern of paraseptal location. The patient remains asymptomatic at all times. Anticoagulation was maintained according to the Thrombology Service guidelines and a venous Doppler study was performed, showing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of both popliteal and posterior tibial veins, the thrombotic material being partially recanalised. In the control Doppler echocardiography, marked RV dilatation persisted with moderate systolic dysfunction and evidence of pulmonary hypertension. An autoimmunity study (ANA, ANCA, AntiDNA, anticardiolipin) was performed on the hospital ward and was negative. Studies of iron, thyroid, tumour markers, HIV, HBV, HCV and proteinogram were normal. Nephrotic syndrome was also ruled out as a cause of hypercoagulability by 24-hour urine study (0.5 g/l protein). Given the persistence of DVT despite anticoagulation with INR at therapeutic target and the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), an inferior vena cava filter implant was indicated. After discharge, the patient was referred to the Heart Failure and Pulmonary Hypertension department of our centre with suspicion of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and to the outpatient haematology department for thrombophilia.  Diagnosis - Pulmonary thromboembolism of the right main pulmonary artery. Clinical suspicion of recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism. - Secondary severe pulmonary hypertension. Suspected chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. - Bilateral deep vein thrombosis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical history and current disease A 32-year-old woman with a personal history of arterial hypertension under treatment with a thiazide diuretic, with good control as usual, and a family history of early ischaemic heart disease without other cardiovascular risk factors. The patient reported episodes in the last five years of oppressive chest pain triggered by exertion (mainly related to holding her young child) that subsided with rest, sometimes appearing at the same level of exertion and sometimes not, lasting a few minutes and with no accompanying vegetative symptoms for which she had not previously consulted, no dyspnoea, syncope or other associated symptoms. The patient consulted the Emergency Department due to an increase in the frequency and intensity of these episodes in the last month, without ever having presented the symptoms at rest. On arrival at the ED, the patient was asymptomatic. After an initial assessment with physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and normal laboratory tests in the ED, it was decided to refer her to our Chest Pain Unit for further study. Asymptomatic with good general condition, eupneic with no signs of heart failure, haemodynamically stable and with good peripheral perfusion. On cardiorespiratory auscultation the patient had rhythmic tones without murmurs and a preserved vesicular murmur without pathological sounds. Peripheral pulses were symmetrical and present. The rest of the physical examination was also unremarkable.  Complementary tests - Electrocardiogram: normal sinus rhythm at 75 bpm without repolarisation alterations - Chest X-ray: normal cardiac silhouette and lung parenchyma - CBC including biochemistry with serial markers of myocardial damage, normal red blood count and coagulation  Clinical evolution The patient was evaluated in the Chest Pain Unit where transthoracic echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart, with preserved global and segmental systolic function, and an ergometry that was clinically positive at the end of the third stage (modified Bruce protocol) showing precordial pressure similar to that usually present and electrically positive from the beginning of stage 1 with a flat-ascending ST-segment descent that reached a maximum of -1.80 mm in, with a functional capacity of 8.5 METS reaching 102% of the HRQoL. A post-exercise echocardiography was performed and showed no alterations in segmental contractility. Echocardiogram: aortic root, aortic valve and postvalvular aorta normal. Normal left atrium. Normal mitral valve. Left ventricle of normal size and thickness. Normal global and segmental systolic function. Ventricular filling: normal filling pattern. Normal right chambers. Ergometry (diagnostic, treadmill, Bruce I protocol, without pharmacological treatment): clinically, at the end of the 3rd stage at minute 6:36 he begins with precordial pressure of the same characteristics as usual, but of less intensity, which subsides with rest. Electrically, with a decrease in ST from V4-V6, with a flat-ascending slope, reaching 2.40 mm, from the beginning of the first stage, and which almost normalises with rest at 1:35 min, and then decreases again to 1.85 mm with a negative slope. Exercise time: 6:58 min, limited by reaching maximal HR and ST decline. Functional capacity: 8.5 METS. Tension response: hypertension at rest with exaggerated response. Normal HR response. Normal HR recovery. Reached 102% of the FCM. No arrhythmias. Based on a low pretest probability for ischaemic heart disease (12-26%) and an intermediate post-test probability (29-51%, Duke score -9), it was decided to continue the outpatient study under anti-ischaemic treatment (beta-blockers and ASA) and to request a coronary CT scan. After starting treatment with beta-blockers, the patient was asymptomatic. The CT scan showed a calcium score of 0, the anterior descending artery (ADA) without significant lesions with little distal development, the circumflex artery (ACx) with very little development, practically non-existent, and the right coronary artery (RCA) very developed, without significant lesions, on which two posterolateral branches depended in addition to the posterior descending artery. Given the typicality and intensity of the symptoms in a young patient who responded to treatment with beta-blockers and the finding of abnormal coronary anatomy, dobutamine stress echocardiography (without beta-blocker treatment) was performed as a second test to detect ischaemia. In addition to confirming the existence of ischaemia, this allowed localisation of the exposed territory, with hypokinesia of all the apical segments at 140 bpm and above, accompanied by symptoms typical of ischaemia. In view of these findings, it was decided to admit the patient for coronary angiography, which showed coronary arteries with anatomical findings coinciding with those described in the CT scan. Selective injection of the LAD showed the existence of a unidirectional intercoronary communication from the distal LAD to a well-developed posterior interventricular artery (PVI), with no evidence of obstructive lesions that could justify the development of collateral circulation. During admission, a hypercoagulability study was performed, which was negative. The patient was discharged with beta-blocker treatment with a diagnosis of myocardial ischaemia secondary to unidirectional intercoronary communication between distal LAD and PVI with coronary steal phenomenon. At the one-year follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic.  Diagnosis Myocardial ischaemia secondary to unidirectional intercoronary communication between distal LAD and PVI with coronary steal phenomenon. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical history and current illness A 68-year-old man with hypertension, operated in 1990 for aortic valve disease with mechanical prosthesis. Complete AV block in the immediate postoperative period requiring implantation of a transient ventricular epicardial pacemaker and epicardial lead in AD, subsequently a permanent ventricular endocardial lead was implanted. The generator was replaced in 2008 and later the ventricular lead was replaced due to malfunction and a new endocardial system was implanted in July 2009. Since 2009, the patient reported periodic skin erosions in the implantation area, with serofibrinous exudate during the following two years, and during the last six months he had episodes of shivering with a few tenths of fever, especially at night, which led him to consult his doctor on several occasions. He came to our centre feverish, with a marked worsening in the last two weeks (39.8oC), affected but haemodynamically stable and with suppuration from the decubitus orifice of the pacemaker, for which he was admitted.  Complementary tests - Physical examination: serofibrinous suppuration through the generator implantation area. - Laboratory tests: leukocytosis of 26,300 (90% PMN), Hb 11 g/dL, CRP 63, creatinine 0.90 mg/dL, urea 35 mg/dL. - Chest X-ray: 3 electrodes are visualised, two of them normoinserted attached to the implanted generator, normoinserted and a dissected epicardial lead lodged in the right atrium. Condensation images are also seen in the right hemithorax. - Blood cultures: two batches taken 30 minutes apart from each other from two different sites and on different days with and without fever, with growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis. - Culture of decubitus exudate: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis. - Transthoracic echocardiography: a vegetation of about 20 mm is visualised in the right atrial cable. Other echocardiographic parameters were normal. No prosthetic dysfunction. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.   Clinical evolution After admission, the infection was treated comprehensively with parenteral bactericidal antibiotherapy directed at the germ isolated in the cultures and the removal of the entire system and a new implant on the right side once the patient remained afebrile and blood cultures were repeatedly negative, after two weeks of antibiotic treatment.  Diagnosis Endocarditis due to infection of the pacemaker generator and leads without valvular involvement. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Medical history and current illness 46-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Followed up by cardiology in childhood for a pathology that the patient cannot specify, with no subsequent follow-ups. She began with sudden symptoms of speech impairment and lower right facial paralysis. In the absence of contraindications and with a normal brain CT scan, fibrinolytic treatment with alteplase was administered, with a good initial neurological response. After 3 hours, the patient presented a new clinical deterioration and a new brain CT scan was performed which showed a left frontoparietal haemorrhage with associated small subarachnoid haemorrhage. Physical examination on admission showed baseline O2 saturation 88%, with signs of peripheral hypoperfusion with lip cyanosis. Cardiac auscultation showed rhythmic tones with audible systolic ejection murmur in all foci. Hypoventilation in the lower third of the left hemithorax on pulmonary auscultation. Neurological examination revealed aphasia of expression and right central facial paresis. During admission, lip cyanosis persisted with low oxygen saturation and platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing tricuspid valve with atrial displacement and severe insufficiency compatible with Ebstein's disease. In addition, an ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD-OS) was observed in the posterior septum with bidirectional shunt. Despite the finding of heart disease with a high risk of embolism in the echocardiogram, it was decided to postpone the start of oral anticoagulation due to extensive cerebral bleeding.  Complementary tests - Laboratory tests: normal. - Arterial blood gases: compensated respiratory acidosis, basal SatO2 77%. - Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 85 bpm, right bundle branch block. - Initial brain CT scan: normal. Post-fibrinolysis brain CT scan: left frontoparietal haematoma and associated small subarachnoid haemorrhage. - Transesophageal echocardiogram: tricuspid with septal leaflet displacement of 38 mm and severe insufficiency, severe right atrial (RA) dilatation, normal right ventricular (RV) contractility, RV-RA gradient 20 mmHg. Celermajer index 1.21. Pulmonary flow and other valves normal. Atrial septal defect (ASD) ostium secundum in posterior septum 15 mm with bidirectional shunt, absence of superoposterior border. - Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly at the expense of the right cavities. Right pleural effusion. - Thoracic CT angiography: right PTE with extensive pulmonary infarction in the lower lobe. - Echo-Doppler of lower limbs: normal.  Clinical evolution During admission, good neurological evolution with complete recovery at the end of the stay. During her stay on the ward, the patient presented increasingly severe episodes of oxygen desaturation, reaching oxygen saturations of 67% at baseline, which improved partially with oxygen therapy. The patient reported progressive dyspnoea until minimal exertion, with limited ambulation in the corridor, which improved in the supine position. Given the very low oxygen saturation figures, which the patient had never presented previously, concomitant pulmonary pathology was suspected. Thoracic CT angiography showed right pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) with extensive pulmonary infarction in the lower lobe. At the time of diagnosis, 10 days had passed since the cerebral bleeding. On finding the PTE, treatment with acenocoumarol was started, with clinical improvement and improvement in oxygen saturation figures. Since then, good clinical evolution, with no new brain bleeds or other embolic complications. Given the data of severe TR, the wide OS-ASD, the deterioration of functional class and the multiple embolism situation (stroke and PTE), tricuspid valve repair surgery and ASD closure were indicated and carried out without complications. The patient is currently in good functional class.  Diagnosis - Left frontoparietal stroke with haemorrhagic transformation - Cardioembolic PTE - Ebstein's anomaly and ASD ostium secundum with bidirectional shunt |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical history and current illness A 72-year-old male smoker with no other history of interest came to the emergency department for abdominal pain, fever and poor general condition. Physical examination revealed calorie and protein malnutrition (body mass index of 13), fever of 38oC and cardiopulmonary auscultation showed a globally decreased vesicular murmur and rhythmic heart sounds with a systolic murmur IV/VI in the peak, radiating to the axilla.  Complementary tests A transthoracic echocardiogram showed cardiac cavities of normal size and contractility, with a 2.5x1 cm mobile mass located in the left atrium and implanted in the fossa ovalis suggestive of atrial myxoma and a myxomatous mitral valve with prolapse of the posterior leaflet with significant insufficiency. With the diagnosis of atrial myxoma, he was admitted to the Cardiology Department to complete the study. The blood test showed haemoglobin 9.3 g/dl, 15,880 leukocytes/mm3 with 86.1% neutrophils and ESR 92 mm. Other parameters and coagulation values were within normal range. Biochemistry showed urea 40 mg/dl, creatinine 1.05 mg/dl, triglycerides 128 mg/dl, total cholesterol 100 mg/dl, HDL 13 mg/dl, LDL 60 mg/dl, total protein 5.4 g/dl, albumin 2 g/dl. Urine sediment showed microscopic haematuria (1-5 red blood cells/field). Blood cultures were taken and were positive for Streptococcus agalactiae. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute with normal repolarisation. In view of these findings, transesophageal echocardiography showed a mobile, pedunculated mass located in the left atrium, implanted in the interatrial septum at the level of the fossa ovalis, smooth in outline and with a small cystic area inside, compatible with atrial myxoma. A mitral valve with prolapse of the P3 segment and 1 cm of vegetation on it was also observed; with severe mitral insufficiency and eccentric jet directed towards the interatrial septum and the myxoma area. Twenty-four hours after admission, he presented transient paresis of the left upper limb, and an urgent cranial computed tomography (CT) scan showed a right frontal lacunar stroke (semioval centre) without being able to determine the time of evolution; therefore, an urgent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment was requested, which confirmed the acute right frontal lacunar stroke (in the semioval centre) as well as acute right hemispheric ischaemic cortical lesions. The study of systemic embolisms was completed with thoracoabdominal CT, highlighting the presence of an extensive cortical hypodense area in the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 6.5x4.6x3 cm and three focal lesions of similar characteristics smaller than 1 cm in the left kidney, suggestive of bilateral renal infarcts. Catheterisation showed a normal coronary tree.  Clinical course Treatment and evolution: antibiotic treatment was started with ampicillin and gentamicin, and in view of the patient's calorie and protein malnutrition, the Nutrition and Rehabilitation Service was contacted for support and complementary treatment, with good initial evolution. The transthoracic echocardiogram twelve days after admission showed a mass in the fossa ovalis with multiple hypoechogenic areas in its interior that seemed to have lost the area of greatest motility located at the apical level. Fifteen days after admission, she presented new febrile peaks, abdominal pain and congestive heart failure, requiring depletive treatment and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Once stable, she was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Department for surgical treatment, and the atrial mass was resected by resection of the fossa ovalis through the right atrium and removal of the tumour and its implantation base through the left atrium. The mitral valve apparatus was completely resected and a St Jude porcine biological prosthesis (model Epic E100-29M) was implanted. The anatomopathological and infectious diagnosis by Polymerase Chain Reaction (universal PCR of the 16S rRNA gene) confirmed atrial myxoma and infectious involvement of the mitral valve by Streptococcus agalactiae and ruled out infection of the mitral valve tumour. Postoperatively, the patient had a torpid evolution with gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and was exsitus.    Diagnosis Atrial myxoma and endocarditis on mitral valve with constitutional syndrome and associated systemic embolisms. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Clinical history and current illness 47-year-old male admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department for dyspnoea and febrile syndrome. No drug allergies. Ex-ADVP. Smoker. HIV C-3 infection on triple antiretroviral therapy until two months ago with good adherence to ART but not attending check-ups. Oesophageal candidiasis. Castlemann's disease diagnosed in 2006, completing chemotherapy treatment with good evolution. Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosed in September 2007 with chemotherapy treatment. Bacteremic pneumonia due to Acinetobacter baumanii in September 2007. Chronic hepatopathy due to HCV without previous decompensation. Sporadic use of inhaled cocaine and cannabis, no injecting drug use. A few months ago, he reported a traffic accident with the death of two close relatives, as a result of which he abandoned his usual treatment and started taking drugs (intravenous cocaine and smoked heroin). Treatment: methadone (25-0-25) and atripla. The patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department for symptoms that started approximately 30 days ago, which debuted as a cough with expectoration that was initially mucopurulent and later rusty. Chest pain that was exacerbated by coughing and inspiration, partially relieved by trunk flexion. Progressive dyspnoea, initially on exertion until becoming resting dyspnoea in the last ten days, with orthopnoea and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Dysthermic sensation with a maximum thermometric fever of 39oC. In view of the clinical manifestations, the Cardiology Service was requested to assess the patient.  Complementary tests - Physical examination: BP 80/45mmHg, HR 115 bpm, satO2 95% baseline, afebrile. Conscious and oriented. Cachectic, with good peripheral perfusion. Tachypneic at rest. Multiple venipuncture sites. Jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic and without murmurs. Conservative vesicular murmur. Soft and depressible abdomen, large hepatomegaly, oedema in the lower extremities and trophic skin lesions. - ECG: sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm, axis at 90o, narrow QRS without repolarisation alterations. - CBC: urea and Cr normal. Na 126, K normal. Hb 10.3 g/dL, leukocytes 16,800 (N 70.2%), platelets 253,000. IP 69%, INR 1.29, APTT 34.7. - Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, condensation in the right pulmonary base. - Echocardiogram: normal LV with preserved global and segmental systolic function. RV not dilated and with preserved systolic function. No valvulopathies. No stigmata of endocarditis. Severe pericardial effusion, enveloping, about 5 cm with signs of tamponade.   Clinical course The echocardiogram showed severe pericardial effusion with signs of tamponade, so evacuating pericardiocentesis was performed by subxiphoid access draining 1000 ml of purulent fluid. Gram staining of the fluid showed gram + cocci in chains, and the culture was positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Blood cultures were negative and pneumococcal antigen positive in urine. Antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. A control echocardiogram was performed, showing that the pericardial effusion had practically resolved, with a minimal amount of fluid remaining in the posterior sac. There were no signs of haemodynamic compromise (no cavitary collapse or respirophasic variations). In a situation of clinical stability, the patient was discharged to the hospital ward for follow-up. Days later, he presented a new clinical and haemodynamic worsening. He was tachycardic and tachypneic, with a tendency to arterial hypotension. The echocardiogram showed severe pericardial effusion and a new evacuating pericardiocentesis was performed, aspirating 250 ml of purulent liquid and leaving him connected to drainage with aspiration with a total debit of 1200 ml in 48 hours.  Diagnosis Pneumococcal purulent pericarditis complicated with cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Medical history and current illness 51-year-old male. Cardiovascular risk factors: former smoking, hypertension since 1998, type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with oral antidiabetics. Anaplastic T-cell lymphoma in 2007 treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and BEAM-conditioned autotransplantation, currently in complete remission. Refractory myelodysplastic cytopenia syndrome with multilineage dysplasia and complex karyotype treated with azacitidine as a bridge to bone marrow transplant. Idiopathic thrombopenic purpura. No known allergies. Cardiological check-up in 2006 with normal ECG, echocardiogram and stress test. He usually reports being asymptomatic cardiovascular. Patient presented to the Emergency Department for 3 days with fever of up to 38.3oC, asthenia, general malaise and general aches and pains. Also, on the day of consultation, he had started with oppressive retrosternal pain of increasing intensity, radiating to the back, shoulders and jaw, which increased in intensity with deep inspiration and supine decubitus, with accompanying malaise and dyspnoea and BP levels of 70/40 mmHg. Physical examination was normal, except for hypoventilation in both lung bases.  Complementary tests - ECG: sinus tachycardia with mild diffuse ST-segment elevation slightly higher than the previous one and non-specific repolarisation alterations. - Laboratory tests showed an increase in infectious-inflammatory parameters (CRP 32; procalcitonin 10); macrocytic anaemia, plateletopenia and leukopenia. Slight increase in myocardial damage markers: CPK 210; CPK MB 19 and troponin T 0.62. Acute renal failure (Cr 2.1) with preserved diuresis (GFR 36 mL/min). Acid-base balance and the rest of the laboratory tests were normal. - Urgent Doppler echocardiogram: global and segmental contractility alterations, pericardial effusion and acute pathology were ruled out. - Chest CT scan: ruled out the existence of acute aortic pathology, pulmonary thromboembolism or significant infectious process.   Clinical evolution During his admission, broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals were administered empirically, without microbiological isolation in blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum cultures. Viral serologies were also negative. Monitoring of myocardial damage markers was performed, with maximum troponin T of 1.59, CPK of 279 and CPK of 43 four days after admission, with progressive decrease and normalisation at discharge. ProBNP was determined and reached a maximum of 8319 pg/mL 5 days after admission. In the absence of an infectious focus, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed 5 days later, showing borderline left ventricular function (LVEF: 0.45-0.50), with no images suggestive of endocarditis or other significant findings. Treatment was started with corticoids, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and diuretics with clinical and analytical improvement, with borderline systolic function persisting in the echocardiogram at discharge. Seen in consultation ten days later, he reported being asymptomatic cardiovascular. He underwent a control electrocardiogram in which the aforementioned alterations persisted, an echocardiogram in which a dilated left ventricle with borderline systolic function was observed, without pericardial effusion or alterations in contractility, and a blood test in which slight thrombopenia and leukopenia persisted, with normal infectious-inflammatory parameters. The following day, an MRI of the heart was performed with adenosine stress, showing signs compatible with acute myopericarditis and borderline systolic function, without inducing myocardial ischaemia. The same treatment was maintained and the patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment one month later.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Male, 67 years old, retired. Active and independent life.   PERSONAL HISTORY No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: ex-smoker of 30 pack-years. Arterial hypertension under treatment for years. Dyslipidaemia under dietary treatment.  Cardiological history At the age of 65 he was referred to an outpatient clinic for an asymptomatic systolic murmur in the mitral focus. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed (2016) showing preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and moderate mitral insufficiency, with no other relevant findings. Outpatient follow-up is scheduled. Other medical history of interest Severe sleep apnoea syndrome with use of CPAP since 2012. Chronic gastritis and hiatal hernia. Depressive syndrome in 2016 resolved. Associated somatoform disorders. Left vocal cord paralysis after prolonged orotracheal intubation for viral pneumonia in 2016. Recent diagnosis of localised prostate neoplasia without distant extension pending prostate resection surgery. Chronic medication Escitalopram 10 mg (1 tablet at breakfast); aliskiren/HTZ 300/12.5 mg (1 tablet at breakfast).  CURRENT ILLNESS He was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital by the mobile ICU after out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest, which was recovered in less than ten minutes with basic cardiac resuscitation manoeuvres (CPR) and a semi-automatic external defibrillator (AED) shock when the rhythm was interpreted as defibrillable. After regaining spontaneous circulation in sinus rhythm, the patient persisted with a low level of consciousness, requiring intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation by the mobile ICU. The event took place in the street, with no close relatives as witnesses. Subsequently, the patient had no memory of what happened at that moment (lacunar amnesia) and reported having been asymptomatic in the previous days.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION On arrival he was afebrile, with heart rate (HR) 82 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 155/83 mmHg and SatO2 100% with orotracheal intubation, connected to mechanical ventilation with FiO2 50%. Carotid auscultation without murmurs. Jugular venous pressure normal. Rhythmic cardiac auscultation with a striking holosystolic murmur in the mitral focus radiating to the axilla (similar to that described in previous cardiology examinations). Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur. Abdominal examination with no pathological findings. Good distal perfusion, without oedema. Central and distal pulses present.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory: biochemistry: glucose 260 mg/dl, creatinine 1.26 mg/dl, urea 36 mg/dl, normal ions, troponin T US 18 ng/l and at 3 hours 32 ng/l (reference value 14 ng/l) and CK 107 U/l. Haemogram: Hb 15.6 g/dl, leucocytes and platelets normal. Coagulation: PT 109%, TTPa and D-Dimer in normal range. Toxins: ethanol not detectable, other toxins in urine negative. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.2, pCO2 65 mmHg, pO2 163 mmHg, bicarbonate 21.3 mmol/l. Portable chest X-ray: cardiomegaly in anteroposterior projection. Endotracheal tube properly positioned. No evidence of pulmonary congestion. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 75 bpm. Normal PR. Left axis. Left anterior hemiblock. Narrow QRS. ST-segment depression of approximately 1 mm in V4-V6 and flattened T wave in aVL. Urgent cranial CT scan: no evidence of acute intracranial pathology. Normal perfusion map and normal supra-aortic trunks. Emergency echocardioscopy: poor echocardiographic window. Left ventricle (LV) of normal size and slightly hypertrophic. LVEF moderately affected by global hypokinesia with zone of thinning and hypocontractility in the inferoposterior basal segment. Normal right ventricle (RV). Mitral regurgitation at least moderate, very eccentric (ischaemic versus prolapsed). Normal aortic and tricuspid valves. No pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography: epicardial coronary arteries with minimal irregularities, without significant stenosis. Regulated transthoracic echocardiogram: preserved LVEF. Posterobasal and inferobasal akinesia. Normal RV. Mitral insufficiency at least moderate (probably severe) with posterior leaflet prolapse. Rest normal. Transesophageal echocardiogram: confirms severe mitral insufficiency due to posterior leaflet prolapse predominantly at P2, with eccentric jet directed anteriorly with Coanda effect. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): mitral prolapse with associated severe mitral insufficiency. Dilated LV (VTD 120 ml/m2). Thinning and hypocontractility of the basal and mid-inferolateral segments, with late intramyocardial enhancement in the basal inferolateral segment. RV of normal size and function.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient's evolution was good during his stay in the ICU, and he was extubated after 24 hours and transferred to the hospital ward stable and asymptomatic. A broad differential diagnosis of cardiorespiratory arrest had already begun in the ED. The complementary tests described above were performed, which led to the diagnosis of malignant mitral prolapse as the cause of the event. During his hospitalisation he presented several bouts of non-sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (with superior axis and right bundle branch block morphology). In view of the severe mitral insufficiency with LV dilatation confirmed by MRI, it was decided in a medical-surgical session to perform mitral valve repair, which took place on admission, with implantation of two 4/0 Goretex neochords at P2 and AM (Physio 30 mm) plus a 30 mm mitral ring, without complications. Subsequently, an automatic defibrillator was implanted for secondary prevention. Clinical progress was satisfactory and he was discharged with the following medication: torasemide 10 mg, ramipril 2.5 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, ferrimanitol ovalbumin 40 mg, metamizol 575 mg and tramadol 100 mg; and follow-up in cardiology outpatient clinics.  DIAGNOSIS Malignant mitral valve prolapse. Resuscitated cardiorespiratory arrest, in defibrillable rhythm. Severe mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral prolapse. Left ventricular dilatation. Non-sustained monoform ventricular tachycardias. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Patient aged 53 years reporting allergy to penicillin (not confirmed by allergy tests). Active smoker (15 packs/year), denies other toxic habits. No pathological history of interest, no surgical interventions. No usual treatment. He came to the emergency department with a high fever of up to 39 ̊C with drowsiness and "clumsiness" in the right hand for one hour. He reported being a teacher and expressed great concern about being unable to write. In the anamnesis, he reported fever and cough with cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy for the last 2 months, which his primary care doctor labelled as mononucleosis syndrome, although this was not confirmed and he did not receive any treatment. Subsequently, despite some improvement in her symptoms, she continued with occasional fever, asthenia and unquantified weight loss. She denies recent trips or risky relationships, no contact with animals, has not had any dental procedures, but refers to a tooth that had been affected by caries for months. Examination on admission: blood pressure 105/60 mmHg, heart rate 81 bpm, saturation 96% basal, 39 ̊C. Pallor. No jugular ingurgitation. Small cervical and axillary lymph nodes. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds with systolic murmur in mitral focus grade 3/6 radiating to the axilla. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur with no additional sounds. Abdomen soft and non-painful, with hepatomegaly of 1-2 fingerbreadths. Upper extremities (EESS) without skin lesions. Lower extremities (LES) without oedema with pulses present, but with erythematous macular lesions on both soles compatible with Janeway spots. Basic neurological examination: Glasgow 14 (O3-V5-M6), bradypsychia with tendency to somnolence, cranial nerves without alterations. EESS with dysmetria in the right upper extremity with preserved strength and sensitivity. No other alterations in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: glycaemia 105 mg/dl, creatinine 0.97 mg/dl, Na 132 mEq/l, Cl 98 mEq/l, K 4.1 mEq/l. Leukocytes 15300/ml with 89% neutrophils. Hb 12.6 g/dl, Hto 38%, platelets 136000/mcl. INR 1.62, PT 18.16 s, AP 58%, FD 421 mg/dl. ESR 83 mm/h, CRP 21 mg/l, procalcitonin 1.38 mg/dl. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: sinus rhythm at 81 bpm, normal axis, normal PR, narrow QRS without repolarisation alterations. Chest X-ray on admission: normal cardiothoracic index, no signs of consolidating focus or vascular redistribution. Blood cultures (positive after 72 hours of admission): Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, no resistance. Serology: HIV, HBV, HCV negative. Brucella, Coxiella, Bartonella negative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on admission: left ventricle (LV) slightly dilated (LVEDD of 56 mm and LVEDV of 165 ml) with normal wall thickness. Preserved LV systolic function (Simpson's estimate ́s 55%). No segmental contractility alterations. Pseudonormal diastolic pattern (E/A 1.8). Slightly dilated left atrium (area 22 cm2). Right chambers at the high limit of normality (RV baseline diameter on A4C of 40 mm) with preserved right ventricular (RV) contractility (TAPSE of 23 mm, S ́ in lateral TDI of tricuspid annulus of 12 cm/sg). Mitral valve (MV): thickened leaflets, not limited in its opening. At the level of the posterior region of the mitral annulus (A3-P3), hyperdense and heterogeneous image with anarchic movement of 18 x 6-7 mm, which is difficult to map by transthoracic access, generating mitral valve destructuring causing moderate-severe mitral insufficiency (MI) characterised by a wide eccentric regurgitation jet towards the lateral wall of the left atrium (LA), VC of 8 mm, E wave of 1.2 m/sg, PISA radius of 10 mm, abolition of flow in the pulmonary valve (PV). Regurgitant volume of 49 ml and ERO of 0.35 cm2. Aortic valve (VAo): trivalve, normal sigmoid, not limited in its opening. Competent. No images suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE) at this level. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI), estimating pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PAAP) 32 mmHg. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with normal inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. TTE in the first 24 hours of admission: study similar to previous TTE. With respect to the MV, large mass of approximately 27 x 16 mm, with irregular borders and echolucent regions inside, located in the region of the posteromedial commissure encompassing part of the P3-A3 scallops. It shows increased mobility with protrusion to the LV. Likewise, a solution of continuity can be seen in the commissural region previously described and in P3, allowing a jet that crosses the echolucent tracts and generating a severe MI contained by this mass. In summary, the image is suggestive of a large abscess. Cranial CT scan on admission: in the non-contrast scan two focal lesions were identified: a 1 cm hyperdense subcortical lesion next to Rolando's fissure surrounded by oedema and another in the right cerebellar hemisphere of heterogeneous density and larger in size (3 cm) with a slight mass effect on the fourth ventricle without producing compressive hydrocephalus. They have a haemorrhagic component. No significant enhancement or annular enhancement after contrast administration. Thoracic-abdominal CT scan 48 hours after admission: hypodense mass measuring 27 x 15 mm located in the posterior and anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (A3 and P3) with extension towards the left atrial cavity, and continuity of the mass to the mitral periannular region; findings compatible with paravalvular abscess. Hepatomegaly with focal hypodense lesion of 4 mm in segment VII of cystic nature. Splenomegaly with the presence of three peripherally located focal hypodense lesions in the posteroinferior region of the spleen suggesting infarcts. In the upper cortical pole of the left kidney there is a focal lesion of 11 mm, with poorly defined contours and small peripheral enhancement (suspicious of abscess). Subpleural pulmonary nodules in the posterior segment of the LSD, the largest of 5 mm with an inflammatory appearance. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 48 hours after admission: multiple small hyperintense lesions in T2 sequences of supratentorial location compatible with microembolism. There is a haemorrhagic lesion already visible on CT imaging in the left parietal convexity with haemorrhagic discharge into the subarachnoid space and another larger lesion located in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Behind it there is another haemorrhagic microfocus. They are hyperintense in T1 and show no significant enhancement after gadolinium injection. The cerebellar lesion causes a discrete mass effect on the fourth ventricle without obliterating it, so there is no evidence of hydrocephalus. Non-specific diffusion study. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen on day 8 of admission: mild homogeneous global hepatomegaly with homogeneous echostructure. Porta permeable. Suprahepatic veins not dilated. No space-occupying lesions (LOE) were observed. Adequately distended gallbladder with preserved wall and normal content. Bile ducts are not dilated. Pancreas and spleen of preserved size, morphology and echostructure. Kidneys of normal size and morphology. Excretory systems not dilated. No abdominal collections, ascites or ultrasound alterations in the gastrointestinal tract.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the clinical manifestations of constitutional syndrome and neurological focality, a cranial CT scan was requested in the emergency department where two lesions with a haemorrhagic component (one cerebral and the other cerebellar) were observed, which could be related to an embolic or metastatic origin. In order to identify their origin and given the presence of mitral systolic murmur on physical examination, a TTE scan was performed which showed a mass dependent on the posterior mitral leaflet with significant MR and a normal-sized left atrium, suggesting acute subacute MR. In addition, blood cultures and serology were taken in the emergency department. The diagnosis of IE was established given the presence of one major criterion (mass dependent on the posterior mitral leaflet) and two minor criteria (fever and embolisms at the level of the brain, cerebellum and IIJS). Despite significant mitral regurgitation, the patient was haemodynamically and neurologically stable, with no signs of heart failure, so it was decided to admit him to the cardiology ward. After discussion with on-call internal medicine (infectious diseases), given his allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics, the aggressiveness of his symptoms and his residence near an area endemic for methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, empirical antibiotic treatment was started with daptomycin iv 675 mg/24 hours, gentamicin iv 200 mg/24 hours and fosfomycin iv 4 g/8 hours. Twenty-four hours after admission, a thoracoabdominal CT scan was performed, revealing multiple embolisms and abscesses in the left kidney and spleen. Transesophageal echocardiography was also performed, revealing a mitral perivalvular abscess in the region of the posteromedial commissure, encompassing part of the A3-P3 scallops and causing severe mitral insufficiency due to partial rupture of the posterior mitral leaflet. At 48 hours later, a cranial MRI was performed, which showed two lesions compatible with infarcts with haemorrhagic transformation and a funduscopic examination to rule out Candida involvement (showing emboligenic involvement). Subsequently, intense asthenia persisted, with slight improvement in neurological symptoms and febrile peaks of up to 39 ̊C. After 72 hours of admission, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus was isolated in several blood cultures, so with two major and two minor criteria the diagnosis of definite IE was established. Once the antibiogram was obtained (fourth day of admission), with no resistance, the infectious diseases department decided to adjust antibiotherapy consisting of ceftriaxone 2 g/24 hours and ciprofloxacin 500 mg/24 hours (controlled administration after verifying an unlikely allergy to penicillins in childhood, and consulting with the HRV allergy department). Clinical improvement in the neurological sphere, with persistence of occasional febrile peaks, so that on the eighth day of admission an ultrasound scan of the abdomen was requested, which was compatible with normality. The case was presented at the medical-surgical session on the third day of admission and in constant communication with cardiac surgery, and after consultation with neurology, it was decided to complete a certain period of time with antibiotherapy prior to surgery. Subsequent good clinical evolution, afebrile, with improvement in writing and controls by radiology by means of CT and MRI (brain MRI control after 10 days which showed a reduction in microbleeds, microinfarcts and previous intraparenchymal haemorrhage). Extraction of the affected tooth by maxillofacial surgery. Finally, on the 33rd day of admission, mitral valve replacement with Saint Jude mechanical prosthesis no. 33 was performed, confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (perivalvular abscess) by pathological anatomy and microbiology. Correct postoperative evolution without incident, being discharged on the 16th day after surgery. He has remained clinically stable until the present day, and has resumed his teaching activity.  DIAGNOSIS Subacute infective endocarditis on native mitral valve due to Aggregatibacter aphrophilus. Perivalvular mitral abscess in the region of the posteromedial commissure, encompassing part of the A3-P3 scallops and causing severe mitral insufficiency due to partial rupture of the posterior mitral leaflet. Multiple septic embolisms (cerebral, cerebellar, splenic, left renal, retinal, distal extremities). Haemorrhagic transformation of cerebral embolic lesions located in the left parietal convexity and right cerebellar hemisphere. Mitral valve replacement with Saint Jude mechanical prosthesis no. 33. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PERSONAL HISTORY This is a 67-year-old patient from France, resident in the summer in a town in the Aragonese Pyrenees. He worked in the construction sector, but is currently retired. There is no record of any previous medical history in our health system. In a report provided by his wife, there are no known drug allergies to date, and his medical history only includes active smoking (IPA 50), type II diabetes mellitus being treated with metformin and hyperuricaemia, for which he takes allopurinol 100 mg every 24 hours.  CURRENT DISEASE At the end of June 2018, after returning home with intense low back pain after doing farm work in an orchard, he takes a diclofenac tablet. Half an hour earlier, he reported having been bitten by an insect that he did not identify. Shortly afterwards, after dinner (during which he had not eaten any new food in his diet), he presented with a pruritic rash, initially on his arms, which quickly became generalised, and a feeling of dyspnoea. Subsequently, he began to experience oppressive central thoracic pain and loss of consciousness with rapid spontaneous recovery with blood pressure (BP) 65/35 and SpO2 88% recorded by the emergency services mobilised to his home. Systemic treatment with methylprednisolone and dexchlorpheniramine was started, and the anaphylactic symptoms resolved. The electrocardiograms (ECG) performed showed transient lower-posterior and lateral ST-segment elevation, so after administering loading doses of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and ticagrelor, he was transferred to our centre by helicopter for urgent coronary angiography. Echocardioscopy was performed in the antechamber and showed hypokinesia of anterolateral and inferolateral basal and medial segments.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION On arrival in the haemodynamics room, the physical examination was normal except for the presence of a discrete rash on the trunk which disappeared during the procedure. BP 105/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80 bpm. Baseline SpO2 97%. Afebrile. Oropharynx slightly hyperemic. No jugular venous engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic sounds without murmurs or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation: minimal scattered wheezing, no hypoventilation. Abdomen: nondescript. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Initial ECG: sinus rhythm at 62 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS with axis at +80o. Up to 4 mm ST-segment elevation in inferior leads, V4-V6, with V1-V3 descent and in high lateral leads. ECG at 60 min (on arrival in the cath lab): sinus rhythm at 54 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, small Q wave in inferior leads with R>S in V2. ST isoelectric in all leads, negative T wave in III and aVF. Chest X-ray on admission: normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Calcified aortic atheromatosis. No signs of acute haemodynamic decompensation, nor images suggesting pulmonary condensation. Echocardioscopy: preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), hypokinesia of basal and medial anterolateral and lateral segments. No mechanical complications or pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram: non-dilated left atrium. Fine mitral valve, slight posterior annular calcification that does not restrict valve opening. Minimal central insufficiency. Normal filling pressures. Left ventricle not dilated (VTDVI 4C 114 cm3, VTSVI 4C 44 cm3), nor hypertrophied. Biplane LVEF 59.7% without clear alterations in segmental contractility. Trivalve aortic valve, normal flow. Aortic root not dilated. Non-dilated right chambers with normal contractility (TAPSE 28). Tricuspid valve with normal flow. No indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion. Urgent coronary angiography (29/06/2018): right dominance. Ischaemic heart disease with severe stenosis of obtuse marginal ostioproximal large-calibre ostial artery (artery responsible for infarction) due to severely calcified plaque and severe stenosis of proximal-medial anterior descending artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention on severe stenosis of CX-MO by means of PTCA with conventional balloons, cutting balloon and rotational atherectomy. Subsequent implantation of a zotarolimus-eluting drug-eluting stent with good angiographic results. Second-time coronary angiography (06/07/2018): good result of the drug-eluting stent implanted on CX-MO. Percutaneous coronary intervention on long calcified plaque in proximal-middle anterior descending coronary artery by means of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and implantation of zotarolimus-eluting drug-eluting stent. Blood tests on admission to the ward: haemogram: Hb 13.1 g/dl; Hct 37.5%; leukocytes 7.3 mil/mm3; platelets 163 mil/mm3. Biochemistry: basal glucose 159 mg/dl; glycated Hb 9.6%, urea 0.33 g/l, creatinine 1 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate estimated by CKD-EPI 76 ml/min/1.73m2, total cholesterol 131 mg/dl, triglycerides 200 mg/dl, HDL-c 30 mg/dl, LDL-c 61 mg/dl, AST 27 U/l, ALT 30 U/l, GGT 28 U/l, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium 4.4 mEq/l. ESR 29 mm (0-20). CRP 1.86 mg/dl. Complement factors C3 and C4 normal. Normal circulating immunocomplexes. Allergy tests: skin tests to common trophoallergens. Negative to (profilin and LTP), soya, latex and anisakis. Total IgE value: 184 IU/ml (0-180). Tryptase value (29/06/2018 IAM day): 14 mcg/ml (0-10). Tryptase value (02/07/2018): 6.03 mcg/ml (0-10). Specific IgE: Pru p 3: < 0.1 ku/l (peach protein) (0-0.35), bee venom < 0.1 ku/l (0-0.35); vespula wasp venom 0.2 ku/l (0-0.35), polistes wasp 1.78 (0-0.35), poliste dominulus 3.76 ku/l (0-0.35). Prick test against diclofenac positive. Maximum myocardial necrosis markers: TnTus 338 ng/l (0-14); CPK 97 U/l (39-308), CK-MB 21 U/l (5-24).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the haemodynamics ward of our centre, the ECG normalised, the chest pain practically disappeared, although some discomfort and regional contractility anomalies persisted as assessed by echocardioscopy, as well as a great improvement in the anaphylactoid reaction. Urgent coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis in an ostioproximal marginal branch with distal TIMI 2-3 flow, in addition to another severe lesion in the LAD. Given the characteristics of the Cx-MO lesion, the intervention was complex, requiring PTCA with cutting balloons and even rotational atherectomy. Despite this, a drug-eluting stent was implanted with good angiographic results. After the procedure, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where he made a very favourable evolution. Suspicion of possible Kounis syndrome type II led to a request for a tryptase blood test, which was positive. After 36 hours in the ICU, where he presented no complications, and without significant elevation of myocardial necrosis markers, he was transferred to the cardiology ward. During admission to the ward she did not present any further episodes of chest pain. Second-time coronary angiography was performed on a severe lesion of the LAD, and another drug-eluting stent was implanted. A regular echocardiogram was performed, showing only slight alterations in LV segmental contractility. The patient was assessed by the allergology department, who performed an analytical study and found normal tryptase, elevated values of specific IgE against wasp venom and a skin test that was positive for diclofenac. Given the good evolution, he was discharged, pending completion of the study and assessment of the need for immunotherapy against wasp venom, which he decided to undergo in his country of origin.  DIAGNOSIS Non-Q Killip I allergic infarction in the context of anaphylactic shock: Kounis syndrome type II. Coronary artery disease of 2 main vessels (anterior descending [AD], circumflex [Cx]) with complete revascularisation. Preserved LVEF at discharge. Anaphylactic shock probably secondary to diclofenac. Sensitisation to wasp venom. Type II diabetes mellitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Apical akinesia and mid-segment akinesia of the anterior face and anterior septum. Non-dilated, non-hypertrophic right ventricle with preserved longitudinal systolic function. Atria of normal size. No significant valvular heart disease. No pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI: left ventricle with global contractility at the limit of normality (LVEF 50%). Hypokinesia of the apical septum, apical anterior face and apex with subendocardial perfusion defect in the middle and apical septum. Late enhancement with subendocardial gadolinium in mid and apical septum. Right ventricle of normal size and morphology with preserved function. Angio-CT of coronary arteries: Coronary arteries with normal anatomical origin. Right dominance. Left coronary artery trunk: vessel of good development, without lesions. Anterior descending: vessel of good development, which after the exit of the first diagonal, in its middle segment, and up to the exit of the second diagonal, a subocclusive lesion with thrombotic content is observed in its interior which could correspond to thrombotic disease or spiroid dissection with thrombosis of the false lumen; after the exit of the second diagonal, the flow is recovered, the middle-distal segment of the anterior descending being of scarce calibre. The ostium of the second diagonal is affected by the lesion previously described in the anterior descending artery. Circumflex artery: the proximal and middle segments of the vessel are well developed, the distal segment being of smaller calibre, with no lesions. Marginal obtuse of good calibre, ending in a bifurcation, without lesions. Right coronary: dominant vessel of very good development, without lesions.

Anterior descending artery (AD) with acute thrombotic occlusion in the proximal-middle third junction with distal TIMI 0 flow. Circumflex artery of good calibre, without significant lesions. Percutaneous coronary intervention: guidewire is advanced to the first diagonal and treated with drug-eluting balloon without stenting. A 2.5 x 38 mm drug-eluting stent was implanted in the middle third of the LAD, leaving TIMI 3 flow in the LAD and second diagonal.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Pain and fever initially subsided in the emergency department with anti-inflammatory drugs. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing mild LV systolic dysfunction with segmental alterations (apical akinesia and mid-segment akinesia of the anterior face and anterior septum). Due to the pericardial characteristics of the pain and the elevation of myocardial damage enzymes, the first diagnostic suspicion is acute myopericarditis, although the electrocardiogram does not show typical signs. However, taking into account the patient's high cardiovascular risk (familial hypercholesterolemia with poor lipid control, active smoking, family history of early ischaemic heart disease), a coronary origin of the condition cannot be ruled out, so the patient is admitted to the coronary unit for monitoring. The patient remained haemodynamically stable, with no arrhythmic events and with disappearance of symptoms with high doses of aspirin and colchicine. In addition, lipid-lowering treatment was reinforced with a high-intensity statin (atorvastatin 80 mg every 24 hours) and treatment for ventricular dysfunction was started with enalapril 2.5 mg every 12 hours (she could not tolerate higher doses due to hypotension), bisoprolol 2.5 mg every 24 hours and eplerenone 25 mg every 24 hours. With suspicion of myopericarditis, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was scheduled for the following day, showing a subendocardial perfusion defect at the level of the mid-apical septum with late enhancement in this area, suggestive of ischaemic heart disease. On the same day, an angio-CT scan of the coronary arteries was also performed, which showed a subocclusive lesion of possible thrombotic origin in the middle LAD, without being able to rule out a coronary dissection. Given that the patient was stable and asymptomatic, it was decided to perform a scheduled coronary angiography two days later, which confirmed the thrombotic occlusion in the proximal-medial LAD. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed on the lesion with implantation of a drug-eluting stent. Prasugrel was added as a second antiplatelet agent. Taking into account the clinical presentation, the results and the evolution, the most likely diagnosis is that of acute anterior myocardial infarction with post-infarction pericarditis without pericardial effusion. The patient progressed favourably and was discharged 7 days after admission. She is recommended to attend the cardiac rehabilitation programme, to stop smoking, and to modify her diet and lifestyle towards healthier habits. Taking into account the poor lipid control (LDL 217 mg/dl) and that she had presented an acute coronary syndrome, it was decided to add ezetimibe 10 mg every 24 hours and to evaluate the need for a PCSK9 inhibitor in the follow-up. The patient subsequently attended cardiac rehabilitation, managed to quit smoking with the help of varenicline and, given that LDL cholesterol remained above target (121 mg/dl) 6 months after the event despite diet and treatment, evolocumab 140 mg in subcutaneous injections every 15 days was added with good response (a reduction in LDL cholesterol levels to 63 mg/dl was observed at 12 weeks).  DIAGNOSIS Acute anterior myocardial infarction evolved with thrombotic occlusion of the middle anterior descending artery, revascularised with a drug-eluting stent. Mild LV systolic dysfunction of ischaemic origin. Acute post-infarction pericarditis without associated pericardial effusion. Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with poor lipid control. Active smoking. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PERSONAL HISTORY 54-year-old woman, no known drug allergies, active and independent life. Family history of Marfan syndrome in a brother with a positive genetic study (mutation in the FBN1 gene). Our patient was tested for this mutation, which was negative, and did not have a marfanoid morphotype. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): smoker of 1 pack a day (IPA 30), no hypertension (HT), no diabetes mellitus (DM), no dyslipidaemia. Cardiological history: Admitted to hospital 3 months ago for chest pain, mainly exertional, of 1 year's duration, with typical characteristics, but of shortened duration and a syncopal episode with a cardiogenic profile. On admission, no arrhythmic alterations were documented after more than 72 hours of continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, echocardiography ruled out relevant structural heart disease and an ischaemia detection test was performed using ergometry, which was clinically and electrically negative, so she was discharged with a diagnosis of non-coronary chest pain and syncope under study and referred to the syncope clinic. On discharge, hygienic-dietary measures were insisted upon, but no pharmacological treatment was started. No other medical or surgical history of interest. No usual medical treatment.  CURRENT ILLNESS Three months after discharge from hospital, while accompanying a relative to the hospital, he again lost consciousness and was immediately transferred to the emergency critical care unit. During the transfer, he suffered cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) manoeuvres were started, with the first rhythm detected after monitoring in ventricular fibrillation requiring three defibrillations at 360J to restore spontaneous circulation and orotracheal intubation (OTI) and connection to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with a total CRA time of 9 min. According to his relative, moments before the onset of the condition, he reported chest discomfort of rapid onset. The first post-arrest ECG, in sinus rhythm, initially showed diffuse ST-segment elevation with an increase in aVR and persistent ST-segment elevation in lateral leads in serial ECGs. Therefore, emergent coronary angiography was performed, showing coronary arteries without angiographic lesions, aortography and ventriculography without data suggesting acute aortic syndrome or alterations in contractility. Echocardioscopy performed in the acute phase showed no significant alterations, including the absence of dilatation of the right chambers suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism or aortic flap. Finally, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where she had a good clinical evolution and early weaning was possible. With no recurrence of arrhythmias during her stay in the ICU, she was transferred to the cardiology ward and monitored for further study and treatment.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Examination on the cardiology ward: blood pressure (BP) 122/94, heart rate (HR) 62 bpm, temperature 36.4 ̊C, baseline SpO2 94%. Conscious and oriented. Normal colour, normohydrated. Eupneic at rest. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones at 78 bpm, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normal ventilation, no added pathological sounds. Abdomen: nondescript. Lower extremities: symmetrical pulses, no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Emergency laboratory tests: no significant alterations. Glucose 195 mg/dl, creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, Na 141 mEq/l, K 3.9 mEq/l, Mg2+: 2.2 mEq/l (normal 1.5-2.5), Ca2+: 9.3 mg/dl (normal 8.8-10.5 mg/dl); D-dimer 452. Myocardial damage markers: initial TnTus < 13 ng/l, CPK 205 U/l; CK-MB 23 (U/l) (normal 5-24). Maximal: TnTus 138 ng/l (0-14); CPK 397 U/l (39-308), CK-MB 51 U/l (5-24).

Haemogram: Hb 15.2 g/dl, Ht 44.1%, leucocytes 9,200, N 60%, platelets 267,000. Catecholamines in 24-hour urine: negative. Chest X-ray: normal CTI, mediastinum and lung fields without significant alterations. Post-arrest ECG: sinus tachycardia at 108 bpm, normal PR, no pre-excitation, narrow QRS, ST-segment elevation of up to 3 mm in V3-V6, and less than 1 mm in inferior leads, with ST-segment elevation of 1 mm in aVR and V1. At 5 minutes only the descent from V4-V6 remains. Normal QTc Normal baseline ECG: sinus rhythm at 88 bpm, normal PR without pre-excitation, no conduction or repolarisation disturbances. Slow R wave progression in precordial leads. Normal QTc. Echocardiogram: left atrium not dilated. Thin leaflet mitral valve with preserved mobility and opening; no regurgitation. Left ventricle neither dilated (LVEDV 4C: 83 ml; LVESV: 25 ml) nor hypertrophic with preserved ejection fraction and no clear segmental alterations of contractility. Preserved GLS (-22.3%). Trivalve aortic valve, thin with good opening and mobility; normal flow. Valvular annulus and aortic root of normal dimensions; the rest of the thoracic aorta cannot be assessed. Right chambers not dilated; right ventricular contractility preserved. Tricuspid valve with good opening and mobility; minimal regurgitation. Pulmonary valve with good opening; flow curve with normal characteristics. No pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion. Continuous ECG monitoring: no arrhythmic or ST alterations for 72 hours. Emergent catheterisation: coronary angiography: epicardial coronary arteries without angiographically significant lesions. Ventriculography: LV neither dilated nor hypertrophied, with preserved global systolic function, without clear segmental alterations in contractility (video 6). Aortography: aortic root and ascending aorta not dilated without angiographic data suggestive of acute aortic syndrome. Ajmaline test: negative.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During admission, he did not present new episodes of chest pain with the treatment given, nor sustained arrhythmias, only a 4-second NSVT flap. Blood and urine catecholamine tests were requested for 24-hour urine and blood tests were negative. Therefore, despite the fact that the baseline electrocardiogram showed no data suggestive of channelopathies (normal QTc, absence of J wave and spontaneous Brugada pattern, previous ergometry without alterations), ajmaline test was performed to unmask a possible hidden Brugada syndrome pattern, which was negative, and finally, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention. After this, the patient was discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of cardiorespiratory arrest due to probable ventricular fibrillation, and treatment was recommended with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/24h, sotalol 80 mg/8h and a high-potency statin given the presence of dyslipidaemia with LDL of 152 mg/dl. One month after implantation, he presented an appropriate ICD discharge due to rapid polymorphic VT and several non-sustained episodes of polymorphic VT. For this reason, low-dose bisoprolol was added. The patient clinically continued with episodes of short-lasting chest discomfort, more frequently since the initiation of beta-blockade. In view of the suspicion of vasospasm, ECG recording of the symptoms was insisted on using 12-lead Holter, which showed, coinciding with two episodes of chest pain, a marked transient ST-segment elevation in the inferior and lateral face and ST-segment underleveling in V1 to V4 (which appears to be posterior ST-segment elevation) lasting about 3 minutes and accompanied by ventricular extrasystoles and a brief NSVT that was interpreted as a transient subepicardial infero-posterolateral lesion, supporting the diagnosis of coronary vasospasm. A new hospital admission was decided to adjust his treatment, suspending the beta-blocker and starting amlodipine and transdermal nitrites. During the first few days he presented repeated episodes of vasospastic angina, one of them with sustained VT and appropriate ICD discharge. Titration to maximum tolerated doses was achieved and finally after association with a second calcium antagonist (verapamil), the clinical symptoms resolved. After more than 72 hours asymptomatic and without arrhythmias, the patient was discharged from hospital, with the following diagnoses and associated with previous treatment with ASA and statin, verapamil 80 mg/8h, amlodipine 5 mg/day, and nitroglycerin patch 5 mg/24h. The patient has had regular check-ups at the cardiology clinic during these 3 years. Since discharge, she has not presented any further syncopal episodes, episodes of chest pain are practically non-existent and ASA has been discontinued after subsequent review that the coronary angiography images showed no significant atherosclerosis, and only in one of the device reviews was there a bout of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) that was successfully treated by means of overstimulation.  DIAGNOSIS High-risk syncope. Cardiorespiratory arrest probably secondary to ventricular fibrillation. Vasospastic angina. ICD implantation in secondary prevention. Sustained and non-sustained ventricular tachycardias in the context of vasospastic angina. Dyslipidaemia with LDL levels outside the target range. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PERSONAL HISTORY Intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) due to duodenal ulcer. CVRF: smoking (20 pack-years). No known cardiological history. Other history: duodenal ulcer 10 years ago. No relevant surgical interventions. Usual treatment: not reported.  CURRENT ILLNESS A 57-year-old male patient with the aforementioned history attended the emergency department of our centre due to oppressive central thoracic pain, of about 30 minutes' evolution, radiating to both upper limbs (MMSS) and neck, which started suddenly while at rest, with associated mild vegetative cramping. On arrival at the emergency department, the clinical manifestations persisted. She denied previous episodes of central thoracic pain. She reported an active daily life. No clinical signs of CHF or infectious disease in previous days.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 140/60 mmHg (left arm), 90/50 mmHg (right arm), heart rate (HR) 65 bpm. SpO2 (FiO2 21%) 99%. Regular general condition, affected by severe pain. Eupneic at rest. Normal colour and normohydrated. Sweating. Patient conscious and oriented, cooperative and alert. No neurological focality. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: regular sounds, diastolic murmur predominantly in the left sternal border. Conservative vesicular murmur (VCM) with no added noise. Abdomen: soft and depressible, without mass or megaliths, not painful on palpation. MMSS: asymmetric radial pulses. Lower limbs: weak and symmetrical distal pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on arrival at the ED: sinus rhythm at 95 bpm, PR 170 ms, narrow QRS, 0o axis, LVH criteria. No changes in serial ECG. Initial laboratory tests: CBC: red blood cells *4.62 10*12/l. Haemoglobin 14.3 g/dl. Haematocrit 42.9%. MCV 92.9 fl. MCH 30.9 pg. MCHC 33.3 g/l. ADE 13.1%. Leukocytes 8.6 10*9/l. Neutrophils 54.6%. Lymphocytes 32,2%. Platelets 198 10*9/l. Haemostasis: prothrombin time (PT) 11 sec. Quick's index 100%, INR 0.95. APTT 28.7 sec. Biochemistry: glucose *103 mg/dl. Sodium 139 mEq/l. Potassium 4.3 mEq/l. Chlorine 103 mEq/l. Urea 34.2 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.86 mg/dl. Biomarkers of myocardial damage: troponin I (hsTnI) 3,2 ng/l. Urgent echocardiogram (TTE) in the critical care unit: left ventricle with slight concentric hypertrophy, normal diameters and preserved systolic function, with no alterations in segmental contractility at rest. Significant aortic insufficiency, without other valvulopathies. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Aortic root with increased diameters (45 mm), without a clear flap image. Normal inferior vena cava (IVC). Mild pericardial effusion. Angio-CT of the aorta: type A aortic dissection with involvement of the aortic root extending along the anterior aspect of the aortic wall close to the left coronary trunk (LMCA) from the valvular plane to the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery with involvement of the proximal origin of the ASD. Dilatation of aortic root and tubular portion of ascending aorta (47 mm). Descending aorta 37 mm. Descending aorta 31 mm. At the level of the thoraco-abdominal aorta, the true lumen has a reduced calibre. The celiac, superior mesenteric and right renal trunks originate from the true lumen. The left renal arises from a gateway between the true lumen and the false lumen with good renal perfusion. Distal aorta and normal iliofemoral sector. Conclusion: type A dissection extending from the aortic root to the aortic segment proximal to the inferior mesenteric origin.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In a patient with intense oppressive chest pain, without significant ECG alterations suggestive of ischaemia, it was decided to perform an urgent TTE, which revealed aortic root dilatation with significant insufficiency. In view of these findings, it was decided to request an angio-CT scan, which confirmed the diagnosis of type A aortic dissection. With the results of the complementary examinations and the diagnosis, the cardiac surgery department was contacted and emergency surgery was performed using the mechanical Bono-Bentall technique (Carboseal 29 mm) (consisting of aortic valve replacement, aortic root and ascending aorta replacement, as well as coronary ostium reimplantation in the same surgical procedure), under extracorporeal circulation, electromechanical heart arrest and circulatory arrest with selective bicarotídeal cerebral perfusion. No replacement of the aortic arch or descending aorta was performed, given the critical condition of the patient, the complexity of the intervention and the improvement after elimination of the main tear and reinstatement of true lumen flow. Evolution in ICU: prolonged stay to 8 days after emergent Bentall surgery. Early extubation at 12 h post IQ without incident. At 48 hours the patient developed global respiratory failure oriented as postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by congruent radiography with image of scattered infiltrates in both lung fields with heterogeneous distribution. Influenza A negative PCR. He required high-flow nasal spectacles, with progressive improvement. On the other hand, acute renal failure resolved. Haemodynamically, the patient remained stable from the immediate postoperative period, with no signs of active bleeding and no transfusion requirements. Good evolution in the cardiac surgery room, with discharge home on 7/3/19.  DIAGNOSIS Acute type A aortic dissection. Emergent surgery with metallic Bono-Bentall. Smoking. Arterial hypertension. Acute respiratory failure due to ARDS. Resolved prerenal renal failure. |O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PERSONAL HISTORY 60-year-old male patient with the following history: Family history of early ischaemic heart disease: brother died of acute myocardial infarction at the age of 48, sister with chronic ischaemic heart disease since the age of 50. No known drug allergies. Arterial hypertension with good control as usual. Diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 in treatment with oral antidiabetics, with last HbA1c 7% (November 2017). Probable difficult to control familial hypercholesterolaemia. Chronic ischaemic heart disease with completely revascularised multivessel disease and preserved biventricular systolic function. Debut in January 2017 with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) of the non-Q acute myocardial infarction (AMI) type, with coronary angiography finding multivessel disease, with severe lesion in the distal trunk affecting the origin of the anterior descending artery (LAD) and severe lesion in the middle third of the right coronary artery (RCA), undergoing triple coronary artery bypass (left internal mammary to LAD, saphenous to obtuse marginal and saphenous to RCA). At discharge echocardiography with preserved systolic function (LVEF 67%) without segmental alterations of contractility and analysis with hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol 200 mg/dl, LDL-C 140 mg/dl, HDL 23 mg/dl) despite treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg. Admission to cardiology in February 2017 due to a new episode of chest pain with pleuritic characteristics and no elevation of myocardial damage markers, with a new echocardiogram performed, superimposing the previous one except for the finding of slight pericardial effusion with no data of haemodynamic compromise. Treatment was started with high-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) with clinical improvement, and the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of Dressler's syndrome. A new blood test also showed LDL-C 201 mg/dl and treatment was started with atorvastatin 80 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg on discharge. Subsequent follow-up in cardiology outpatient clinics, with good functional class and no effort angina, as well as good therapeutic compliance with controlled blood pressure and good glycaemic control. In analytical tests, hypercholesterolemia persisted with marked elevation of LDL-C levels. Other surgical interventions: meniscopathy.  CURRENT DISEASE 60-year-old patient under follow-up in cardiology outpatient clinic since previous admission for AMI undergoing surgical revascularisation. The patient reports being in good clinical condition, with no angina or dyspnoea on exertion after discharge. He denies orthopnoea or episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He reported having completed the cardiac rehabilitation programme and was living a routine life without limitations. He attended the consultation to collect the results.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Good general condition. Conscious, oriented. Well hydrated and perfused. Eupneic at rest. SatO2 98% without oxygen therapy. Blood pressure (BP) 130/80, heart rate (HR) 70. No jugular engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, at a good frequency. No murmurs or audible extratonos. Conserved vesicular murmur, without pathological noises. Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Distal pulses preserved and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG (April 2018): sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, normal axis, normal PR, narrow QRS, Q wave in III and aVF with negative T in I and aVL, no other repolarisation alterations, no signs of acute ischaemia, normal QTc. Echocardiography (April 2018): non-dilated left ventricle without hypertrophy of its walls. Left atrium slightly dilated. Thoracic aorta within the normal range. No significant valvular heart disease. Preserved left ventricular systolic function, with LVEF calculated by Simpson BP at 67%, without segmental contractility disorders. Transmitral filling pattern of impaired relaxation without increased filling pressures. Inferior vena cava not dilated with adequate inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. CBC (April 2018): CBC: leukocytes 8,100 units, haemoglobin 13.4 g/dl, platelets 339,000 units. Biochemistry: Cr 0.84 mg/dl, normal ions, normal hepatobiliary profile. HbA1c 7.0% Lipid profile: total cholesterol 345 mg/dl, LDLc 278 mg/dl, HDL 52 mg/dl, triglycerides 75 mg/dl. Blood tests (June 2018, after starting alirocumab): CBC: leukocytes 9,100 units, haemoglobin 13.9 g/dl, platelets 280,000 units. Biochemistry: Cr 0.90 mg/dl, normal ions, normal hepatobiliary profile. HbA1c 6.9%. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 147 mg/dl, LDL-C 78 mg/dl, HDL 55 mg/dl, triglycerides 72 mg/dl.   CLINICAL COURSE The patient attended the consultation to collect the results, reporting a good clinical condition. He denies myalgia with high-dose statin treatment, but reports concern about the difficulty of controlling his cholesterol given his personal and family history. He reported good compliance with treatment, with good control of blood pressure and blood glucose levels at home, as well as the recommended hygienic and dietary measures. The control blood test showed persistent hypercholesterolaemia, with total cholesterol levels of 345 mg/dl and LDL-C of 278 mg/dl despite treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg. Given that the cholesterol levels were far from the optimal range, it was decided to start treatment with alirocumab 150 mg every two weeks and to review in one month with a new blood test. The patient returned for another check-up in June 2018, denying having had any adverse reaction after starting treatment. The control analysis showed a total cholesterol level of 147 mg/dl with LDL-C levels of 78 mg/dl.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease with completely surgically revascularised multivessel disease and preserved left ventricular systolic function. Probable familial hypercholesterolemia of very difficult control. Arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus with good control. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Abdominal-pelvic CT scan: no space-occupying lesions were seen in the blood parenchyma, which had a normal morphology. There is no evidence of retroperitoneal pathology. Kidneys with cortical notches of normal size and morphology. The rest of the examination showed no significant tomographic findings.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the cardiology department with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation, with an intermediate risk profile. Preferential coronary angiography was performed with implantation of a drug-eluting stent in the right ostial coronary artery, which presented a critical ostial lesion, with no other angiographically significant lesions. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on admission with no notable alterations. The patient, who was already on double antiplatelet therapy, was discharged after an admission without notable complications, adding bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily to her usual treatment and replacing the previous lipid-lowering treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg. At this time the patient's LDL cholesterol level was 98 mg/dl. After a period of one month of home treatment, the patient visited her primary care physician for lumbar pain radiating to the right abdomen and the physician performed a blood test showing hypertransaminasemia with GOT levels of 677 IU/l and GPT of 701 IU/l, referring the patient to the emergency department. The patient was readmitted to the emergency department, where she reported asthenia, weakness predominantly in the shoulder girdle, and a repeat laboratory test was performed, expanding the parameters (see section on complementary tests). The patient was admitted to the internal medicine department for hypertransaminasemia under study, rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure with a pre-renal profile. During her admission to internal medicine, an ultrasound scan of the abdomen and abdominal CT scan were performed (see section on complementary tests) to assess retroperitoneal pathology. Finally, she was diagnosed with toxic hepatitis and rhabdomyolysis related to statins. The patient progressed favourably during her admission and was discharged with ezetimibe 10 mg every 24 hours. To date, the patient has continued her check-ups in cardiology consultations with no new notable events and her LDL cholesterol levels are 105 mg/dl, with transaminase and creatine phosphokinase levels within the normal range.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation. Toxic hepatitis and rhabdomyolysis related to treatment with statins. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 78-year-old woman. She is hypertensive, diabetic on oral treatment and hyperuricaemic. In addition, she had an infiltrating breast carcinoma treated 8 years ago with radical mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and is currently free of disease. Hepatitis B cured. Intrathoracic goitre. As cardiological history, she has permanent atrial fibrillation treated with direct-acting anticoagulant and, in the face of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, due to a history of thoracic radiation, percutaneous replacement with Corevalve Evolut 26 transfemoral TAVI implant was chosen one year ago, with no incidents. On regular treatment with digoxin 0.5 mg (1-0-0), dabigatran 150 mg (1-0-1), valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg (1-0-0), furosemide 40 (1-0-0), allopurinol 100 (0-1-0) and metformin 850 (0-1-0). She reported febrile symptoms of one week's evolution, with fever of more than 38 ̊C thermometrically measured, treated with fosfomycin by her general practitioner for suspected urinary tract infection, with little improvement. Twenty-four hours after starting antibiotic treatment, she began with liquid diarrhoea without pathological products and intense periumbilical pain, also associated with the progressive appearance of oedema in the legs and progressive dyspnoea, for which she went to the emergency department. She denied cough or expectoration, as well as chest pain, dizziness or syncope. She also had no neurological focality. She was admitted to the internal medicine department as a possible complicated urinary tract infection for study and treatment. On examination, she had a blood pressure of 95/62 mmHg, a heart rate of 85 bpm, fever of 37.9 ̊C and was eupneic with nasal goggles at 2 l/min (O2 saturation 97%). Jugular venous pressure is increased. On auscultation she is arrhythmic at 80 bpm, with murmur in aortic focus II/VI and normal second sound; she also has hypoventilation in the bases and crackles in the midfields. The abdomen was soft, depressible and painful at the epigastric level, with no evidence of peritoneal irritation or visceromegaly. Lower extremities with oedema with pitting up to the knee, with no evidence of venous thrombosis. Peripheral pulses present and symmetrical. No peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation at 80 bpm, narrow QRS, normal axis. Repolarisation abnormalities corresponding to a digitalis tray. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. TAVI in aortic position. Vascular redistribution and fluid in cystic cracks compatible with heart failure. Widening of the superior mediastinum compatible with known endothoracic goitre. Analysis: Biochemistry: glucose 98 mg/dl, Cr 1 mg/dl, GFR 54 ml/min, urea 59 mg/dl, Na 125 mEq/l, K 5.8 mEq/l, digoxinemia 2.3 ng/dl. Thyroid hormones normal. Liver function tests: GOT 320 IU/l, GPT 270 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.64 mg/dl (direct bilirubin 2.22 mg/dl), albumin 2.14 g/dl, amylase 449 U/l. Iron profile: iron 156 μg/dl, transferrin 120 mg/dl, IST 139%, ferritin 1,755 ng/ml. ProBNP 3,410 pg/ml. Infectious markers: CRP 152 mg/l, PCT 6.9 ng/ml. Haemogram: leucocytes 21,000/μl with 12% of keys, Hb 7.8 g/dl, platelets 91,000/μl. Coagulation: INR 1.88, PT 42%. Blood cultures: two positive series for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, with positive synergism with aminoglycosides. Urine: isolated red blood cells. No leucocyturia or bacteriuria, negative nitrites Faeces: usual flora, no parasites and negative Clostridium difficile toxin. Serology: HIV and HCV negative. Anti HBs and Anti HBc positive. Autoimmunity study: ANA, ANCA, Anti native DNA, ENAS, CH 50 and C4 normal and/or negative. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal diameter and thickness with normal global and segmental systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction. Slight dilatation of the left atrium. Normofunctioning aortic biological prosthesis with known trivial insufficiency. Mild mitral insufficiency and tricuspid insufficiency, with mild pulmonary hypertension at rest. No images suggestive of endocarditis are detected. Transesophageal echocardiogram: CoreValve TAVI type aortic bioprosthesis with several small mobile images, mainly at the level of the right coronary leaflet equivalent and another small image, with identical characteristics, adhered to the stent at the same level, suggestive of endocarditis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On admission, antibiotic treatment was started empirically with ceftriaxone with initial suspicion of pyelonephritis, later changing to cloxacillin, rifampicin and gentamicin at a dose of endocarditis due to high clinical suspicion, despite the initial negative transthoracic echocardiogram. The study was later completed with a transesophageal echocardiogram that showed images compatible with endocarditis on TAVI, establishing the diagnosis with positive blood cultures for S. aureus. Treatment with gentamicin was maintained due to microbiological evidence of synergy with cloxacillin, but the patient suffered a rapid deterioration of renal function, with a drop in glomerular filtration rate to 6 ml/min. Rapidly progressive worsening with evidence of septic shock with anuria, decreased level of consciousness and coagulopathy, refractory to initial measures. The case was discussed with cardiology, internal medicine and the infectious diseases department, and in this critical situation, further valve replacement or other aggressive measures were rejected, and the patient died in the context of septic shock secondary to endocarditis on TAVI.  DIAGNOSIS Late endocarditis on TAVI aortic bioprosthesis due to Staphylococcus aureus. Acute renal failure in the context of gentamicin. Septic shock with multi-organ failure. Death. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CA 125 (carbohydrate antigen 125) 7 U/ml. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.1%. NT-proBNP (natriuretic propeptide B) 9 pg/mL. ECG: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm. Normal PR. QRS 160 ms with morphology similar to complete right bundle branch block of the right bundle branch of the His (BCRDHH) in V1 with end-force QRS filling and elevation of the J point in this lead. Chest X-ray: cardiac silhouette and mediastinum of normal size. No areas of consolidation or pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle of normal diameter and thickness with adequate contractility, without segmental alterations. Transmitral flow pattern of prolonged relaxation. Left atrium of normal dimensions. Fine leaflet mitral valve with normal opening, without regurgitation. Tricommissural aortic valve with normal opening, without regurgitation. Right chambers of normal dimensions with no evidence of PHT. Brain CT scan: mild corticosubcortical atrophy with ventricular enlargement already described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 2015. Centred midline. No signs of acute bleeding or oedema. Calota without alterations. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (video 1): left ventricle with wall thickness, volumes (IVTDVI 59 ml/m2; IVTSVI 21 ml/m2) and segmental and global systolic function within normal (LVEF 65%). Right ventricle volume (IVTDVD 68 ml/m2; IVTSVD 28 ml/m2) and systolic function preserved (RVEF 58%). Free wall morphology and preserved segmental contractility. Atria and great vessels of preserved dimensions. First-pass perfusion at rest (gadoteric acid iv 0.15 mmol/kg, without complications) normal. Absence of myocardial fibrosis or necrosis. Morphological (without and with contrast) and functional study within normality. Electrophysiological study: under local anaesthesia and under fluoroscopic control, three quadripolar electrocatheters are introduced via the right femoral vein and placed alternately in the descending artery (DA), AV zone and RV for recording and stimulation. The procedure is performed without complications. Basically the conduction intervals are AV: LC 704 ms, AH 95 ms, HV: 44 ms. The nodal Wenckebach point was obtained at 190 bpm. No VA conduction is observed above 100 bpm. Programmed atrial pacing (increasing rates and extrastimulus test with two cycles and up to three ES) did not induce significant arrhythmias. Right and left carotid sinus massage (CSM) did not induce significant block or pauses, nor significant fall in blood pressure (BP). Procainamide perfusion (10 mg/kg) over 10 min did not induce significant lengthening of the HV interval. Implantable Holter: episode of asystole preceded by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia triggered by ventricular extrasystole with T-wave coupling. Coronary angiography: no significant angiographic lesions were observed. Flecainide test: administration of 2 mg/kg iv flecainide produces an increase in J-point elevation of 2 to 4 mV without exhibiting typical Brugada type 1 pattern, so it cannot be considered positive. Genetic testing for sudden death: no clinically relevant variants have been identified.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION As this was a 63-year-old patient with repeated syncope suggestive of cardiogenic origin, it was decided to admit him to the cardiology department to complete the stiological study. Cardiac imaging studies were performed with transthoracic echocardiography and CMR, which showed no structural alterations. During her hospital stay she did not present arrhythmic events on continuous monitoring. A cranial CT scan was performed, which showed no significant alterations. In addition, as she presented complete right bundle branch block (image 1), it was decided to complete the aetiological study with an electrophysiological study and carotid sinus massage, which did not prove the cause of the syncope. Finally, given the high suspicion of cardiogenic origin, it was decided to implant a subcutaneous Holter (Reveal®) for continuous ambulatory monitoring. During review of the monitoring alerts, a tracing was detected. The patient was notified to interrogate the subcutaneous Holter (Reveal®), which revealed an episode of ventricular fibrillation and subsequent asystole triggered by ventricular extrasystole with T-wave coupling. The patient reported that he had suffered a syncopal episode of identical characteristics to the previous ones. Given the morphology of the QRS in the baseline ECG, a flecainide test was performed with an increase in the J point in V1 and V2 without exhibiting a typical Brugada pattern. Following the indications of the clinical practice guidelines on sudden death and ventricular tachycardia, coronary angiography was requested, which showed no significant lesions. Genetic testing was requested for the study of sudden death without structural heart disease, including the genes most frequently associated with Brugada syndrome and catecholaminergic ventricular tachycardia, but no clinically relevant variants were identified. In view of the repeated syncope and the finding of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation was decided for secondary prevention. Subsequently, during follow-up in outpatient clinics, on performing a detailed and directed family tree, it was found that the paternal grandfather had sudden death at the age of 56 and that one of his paternal uncles had been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome after sudden death had been recovered (with negative genetics, but with a type 1 pattern).  DIAGNOSIS Repeated cardiogenic syncope in the context of ventricular fibrillation due to probable Brugada syndrome. ICD implantation for secondary prevention. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 26-year-old male admitted for chest pain and elevated markers of myocardial damage.  PERSONAL HISTORY Baseline: native of Colombia. Resident in Spain for the last month. Works as a gardener. No known drug allergies. No cardiovascular risk factors. No toxic habits. No personal or family cardiological history. Surgical interventions: splenectomy after traffic accident. Previous medication: none.  CURRENT DISEASE Asymptomatic patient from the cardiovascular point of view, who two weeks before admission started episodes of oppressive central thoracic pain radiating to both jaws, unrelated to exercise or respiratory movements. No vegetative cortex associated. Self-limited cessation of these episodes within a few minutes. She also reported non-specific dizziness and occasional dystrophic sensation, without thermometric fever. No palpitations, dyspnoea or syncopal symptoms. She denied previous infectious symptoms.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Afebrile, blood pressure 106/62 mmHg, heart rate 60 bpm, baseline O2 saturation 98%, referred weight 70 kg. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Well hydrated and perfused. Good general condition. Eupneic at rest. Jugular venous pressure normal. No palpable lymph nodes. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without murmurs or rubbing. Pulmonary auscultation: respiratory sounds were preserved with no over-additions. Abdomen: soft, depressible and non-painful. No masses or megaliths palpable. Peristalsis present. Lower extremities: no oedema. Distal pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm. Normal PR. Narrow QRS. Q wave at the limit of pathological significance and ST elevation 0.5 mm in the inferior face. Laboratory tests on admission: haemoglobin 15 g/dl, platelets 350.000 u/mm3, leukocytes 11.3 x103/mm3 (neutrophils 33.4%-3790 u/l, lymphocytes 31.4%-3560 u/l, eosinophils 27.7%-3150 u/l), basal glucose 81 mg/dl, urea 23 mg/dl, creatinine 0.79 mg/dl, sodium 131 mEq/l, potassium 4.2 mEq/l, conventional troponin I 2.7 ng/dl (normal < 0.01). Chest X-ray: normal cardio-thoracic index. No acute pleuroparenchymal lesions. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle, normal thickness, no alterations in segmental contractility. Normal systolic function (biplane Simpson LVEF 65%). Hyperechogenic appearance of the inferolateral wall myocardium respecting the endocardium. Right ventricle of normal size with preserved systolic function. Mitral valve of normal appearance and function. Trivalve aortic valve, without insufficiency or stenosis. Tricuspid valve of normal appearance, with minimal insufficiency. Normal functioning pulmonary valve. Aortic root of normal size, no coarctation. No pericardial effusion. Cardio-MRI: ventricles of preserved size and function. Hypokinesia, oedema and late intramyocardial enhancement of subepicardial predominance in the inferolateral face are observed; findings that may be related to myocarditis in the appropriate clinical context. CT of coronary arteries: total calcium score according to Agatson index 0. Coronary arteries without anatomical variants, with preserved patency, without thrombotic or stenotic images.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the coronary unit for monitoring and further complementary tests. As a specific cardiological test, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which was normal, followed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), which was found to be compatible with myocarditis. After 48 hours without development of arrhythmic complications or heart failure, he was transferred to the hospital ward for further care and to complete studies. The analysis on admission showed leukocytosis due to marked eosinophilia that persisted in subsequent analyses, so an assessment was requested by internal medicine, which expanded the battery of tests with autoimmunity, virus and infectious serology, which was positive for IgM Toxocara spp. Subsequently, a CT scan of the coronary arteries was requested to rule out embolisms, which was also normal. Suspicion of eosinophilic myocarditis secondary to Toxocara parasite infection led to treatment with albendazole. The patient had a good clinical evolution and was discharged from hospital after 7 days asymptomatic, with normalisation of myocardial damage markers and decreasing eosinophilia.  DIAGNOSIS Eosinophilic myocarditis in the context of toxocariasis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 49-year-old woman, under cardiology control since admission in 2015.  BACKGROUND: Family history: father with infarction at 52 years of age and mother with ischaemic heart disease from 70 years of age. No known allergies. No toxic habits, no arterial hypertension (AHT) or diabetes mellitus (DM). Obesity (in 2015, weight 85 kg and height 165 cm, representing a body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m2). Hypercholesterolaemia diagnosed on admission in 2015: total cholesterol 271 mg/dl, triglycerides 184 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 36 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (calculated) 198 mg/dl. No treatment prior to admission. Cardiological history: admission in June 2015 for acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation (STEMI) of lateral location. Cardiac catheterisation showed single-vessel coronary artery disease, with thrombotic occlusion of the first diagonal, on which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with drug-eluting stent and intermediate stenosis in the middle anterior descending artery (LAD) (FFR > 0.8) (videos 1-3). Echocardiogram showed akinesia in the middle and apical segments of the anterior septum and anterior face, with overall left ventricular (LV) systolic function of 65%. He continued the cardiac rehabilitation programme until November 2015.  CURRENT DISEASE: Monitored in cardiology consultation since the end of 2016. On treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/day (discontinued ticagrelor one year after acute myocardial infarction [AMI]), bisoprolol 25 mg/day, losartan 50 mg/day (presented cough with ramipril), omeprazole 20 mg/day, atorvastatin 80 mg/day. In the blood test in November 2016, LDL-C levels of 160 mg/dL persisted, well above the target, so ezetimibe 10 mg/day was associated, with a new control after 3 months (the results and therapeutic strategy will be discussed in the section on clinical course). In August 2017, she reported retrosternal discomfort that she described as "burning" unrelated to exertion, although she commented that she had worse tolerance to physical exercise. He acknowledges that he leads a more sedentary life. No significant alterations in the electrocardiogram (ECG) (image 1). The echocardiographic window is not adequate for stress echocardiography and stress single photon emission tomography (SPECT) is requested. At the last review, in December 2017, she was cardiologically asymptomatic. The burning discomfort has disappeared after her primary care physician switched her from omeprazole to esomeprazole. She exercises regularly and has lost 5 kg since August 2017.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Good general condition. Weight 75 kg, height 165 cm. Abdominal waist 95 cm. Blood pressure (BP) 140/67 mmHg. No corneal arc, no tendon xanthomas on inspection. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: ventilation preserved. RsCsRs at 70 beats/min, no murmurs or extratonos. Abdomen soft, depressible, without masses or visceromegaly. Peripheral pulses present, no oedema.    COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CARDIAC CATHETERISM on admission in 2015: thrombotic occlusion of the first diagonal of great development. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and drug-eluting stent implantation. Intermediate lesion in the middle anterior descending artery (AD) assessed at a second time: FFR 0.96 and 0.89 at distal level. Right coronary artery without significant stenosis. ANALYTICS in February 2017): blood count without alterations. Glycaemia 92 mg/dl. glycohaemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.5%. GFR > 90 ml/min. Normal liver tests. Total cholesterol 226 mg/dl, HDLc 38 mg/dl, triglycerides 170 mg/dl, LDLc 144 mg/dl. ECG August 2017 (image 1): sinus rhythm at 77 bpm, poor R wave progression in right precordial leads with flattened ST (unchanged from previous). EFFORT SPECT in August 2017 (image 2): exercise stress test according to Bruce protocol. Baseline: heart rate (HR) 68 bpm, BP 122/85 mmHg. Suspended at 6:30 min for reaching targets: HR 155 bpm (90% FHRT) and BP 165/90 mmHg. No angina. Dyspnoea at maximum effort. No ECG changes. Postexercise tomographic images show a severe fixed anteroapical perfusion defect, without reperfusion on rest images. LV systolic function by gated-SPECT 56%, anterior hypokinesia.  CLINICAL COURSE Young woman at the onset of her coronary artery disease (46 years old, premenopausal) with unknown history of hypercholesterolemia, probably familial. After admission for AMI, optimal medical treatment was prescribed, including high-dose statin and she was referred to a cardiac rehabilitation programme. Subsequent follow-up in consultation detected LDL-C levels well above target (<70 mg/dl), so it was decided to add ezetimibe to the atorvastatin 80 mg she had been taking since admission, before considering treatment with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (iPCSK9) inhibitors (which had been available for a very short time). After 3 months (February 2017), LDL-C was 144 mg/dL, so evolocumab 140 mg/2 weeks was added to treatment in March 2017. Monthly controls during the following 3 months were: April 2017: total cholesterol 90 mg/dl, HDLc36 mg/dl, LDLc 37 mg/dl. May 2017: total cholesterol 73 mg/dl, HDL-C 42 mg/dl, LDL-C 19 mg/dl. Ezetimibe is withdrawn. June 2017: total cholesterol 99 mg/dl, HDL-C 34 mg/dl, LDL-C 47 mg/dl. And the following LDL-C values: 48 mg/dl (September 2017); 60 mg/dl (December 2017); 65 mg/dl (March 2018). She has had no adverse effects related to lipid-lowering therapy. Blood glucose levels < 100 mg/dl; HbA1c < 5.6%, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 90 ml/min and normal liver tests are maintained. The SPECT scan performed to rule out coronary origin of the chest discomfort showed an area of necrosis without inducible ischaemia. Exercise tolerance improved by resuming regular physical activity and it was concluded that the symptoms were of digestive origin.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease. AMI in 2015, single-vessel coronary artery disease (first diagonal) with complete revascularisation. Moderate stenosis in the middle LAD. Preserved LV ventricular systolic function. Current functional class I. Hypercholesterolemia difficult to control. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND: Family history: father and one brother disease with early coronary heart disease (< 55 years) and hypercholesterolemia. Non-smoker. No arterial hypertension (AHT) or diabetes mellitus (DM). Drinker of two glasses of wine/day and a few drinks at weekends. Probable familial hypercholesterolaemia. In 2004. Total cholesterol 326 mg/dl, triglycerides 102 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 65 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 245 mg/dl. Intolerance to atorvastatin 10 mg: alteration of liver tests in 2009: GOT 366 U/L; GPT 981 U/L; GGT 699 U/L, normalised after discontinuation of statin. Liver ultrasound with no alterations. Fatty liver (slight elevation of GGT and ultrasound in 2016).  CURRENT ILLNESS: February 2018: consultation for having presented with diffuse chest pain the previous day, oppressive, after climbing a steep slope, lasting approximately 5 minutes, which subsided after stopping the effort. In the last 6 months, more sedentary lifestyle; previously well-tolerated physical exercise.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Good general condition, blood pressure (BP) 137/80 mmHg, height 171, weight 76, body mass index (BMI) 26, head and neck without alterations. Cardiopulmonary auscultation normal. Abdomen and extremities normal. No corneal arcus, xanthomas or xanthelasmas.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm 80 per min, incomplete right bundle branch block, without repolarisation alterations. Laboratory tests (ED): haemoglobin 15.6 g/dl, leucocytes 7410, platelets 200,000, glucose 108 mg/dl (not basal), creatinine 0.91 mg/d, sodium 144 mEq/l, potassium 4.5 mEq/l, transaminases (GOT and GPT) normal, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) 85 U/L, troponin I negative. ANALYTICS (fasting): glucose 95 mg/dl, glycohaemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.4%, FGE > 90 ml/min, total cholesterol 267 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 54 mg/dl, triglycerides 115 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 190 mg/dl. ECOCARDIOGRAM: cardiac cavities of normal dimensions. Global and segmental systolic function of the left ventricle without alterations. No valvulopathies, short circuits or pericardial effusion. ERGOMETRY: Bruce protocol, basal heart rate (HR) 70 bpm, BP 135/70 mmHg. Suspended at 10.30 minutes. HR 178 bpm and BP 175/80 mmHg. Clinical and ECG negative. 12 metabolic equivalents (METs) (image 2). CORONARY ANGIO-CT: (after administration of atenolol iv, sinus rhythm 62 per min), acceptable quality of the study, with very slight step artifacts. Origin and course of the coronary arteries normal. Left coronary trunk (15 mm) without stenosis or calcifications, anterior descending artery, after the origin of a large first diagonal presents a moderate stenosis (50-75%) concentric, without calcified plaque, in the middle segment of about 10 mm. Circumflex artery hypoplastic, with a slight non-calcified lesion at its origin (< 50%). Intermediate branch of small development. Dominant right coronary artery, without significant stenosis or calcifications, originating a large posterolateral branch with a mild, non-calcified stenosis (< 50%) at its origin.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Patient with a family history of early coronary heart disease and suspected familial hypercholesterolemia, asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view until the current episode, highly suggestive of exertional angina. Years earlier he had received treatment with statins, initially simvastatin 20, but this was replaced due to ineffectiveness (LDL-C > 180 mg/d) by atorvastatin 10, which had to be discontinued due to liver damage, reversible when treatment was discontinued. This occurred in 2009 (at that time he had dropped to LDL 129 mg/dl). Since then, without lipid-lowering treatment, he has maintained LDL-C levels between 180 and 250 mg/dl. Currently, she consulted for a single chest pain related to greater than usual exertion; an acute event was ruled out and exercise testing was performed, which was negative for 12 METs, but due to the likelihood of coronary disease (typical symptoms, family history and hypercholesterolemia maintained for many years), coronary angio-CT was requested, which showed several non-significant stenoses in the coronary tree. In view of these results, antiplatelet treatment was started (acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg), beta-blockers (bisoprolol 2.5 mg) and ramipril (2.5 mg), in addition to lipid-lowering treatment in this case with a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (iPCSK9) inhibitor (evolocumab 140 mg/2 weeks) due to a history of probable familial hypercholesterolaemia, intolerance to the initial dose of atorvastatin and ineffectiveness with another less potent statin and the presence of coronary heart disease. The patient is currently awaiting the results of a genetic study.  DIAGNOSIS Probable familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Intolerance to statins. Exertional angina. Coronary artery disease with non-significant stenosis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 56-year-old male, no allergies, ex-smoker and paranoid schizophrenia treated in the past with ECT and multiple antipsychotics. He was found unconscious by his brother; on arrival of the ambulance he presented blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg with O2 saturation of 65%, temperature 34.8 °C. On auscultation he had crackles and rhonchi in both lung fields. Orotracheal intubation was performed and catecholamine perfusion (noradrenaline and adrenaline) was started. On arrival at the emergency department, a cardiological assessment was requested for an electrocardiogram (ECG) suggestive of inferolateral infarction. The ECG showed a nodal rhythm with QRS of 120 ms and rSR morphology of V2-V6 with the last R tied to the ST. Echocardioscopy with preserved left ventricular (LV) function and no segmental alterations. Laboratory tests described in evidence. The chest X-ray was compatible with multilobar pneumonia. Cardiology maintained a wait-and-see attitude, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of the respiratory infectious process.    COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Arrival ECG: nodal rhythm with QRS of 120 ms and rSR morphology of V2-V6 with the last R tied to the ST. ECG after temperature correction: virtual disappearance of Osborn waves, returning to normal sinus rhythm. ANALYSIS: haemoglobin 14.4 g/dl, haematocrit 41.6%, leukocytes 1700x10^3/μl, neutrophils 93.3%, platelets 133,000x10^3/μl. Coagulation: INR 1.61, IQ 52%, PT 17.1, APTT 42.9, D-dimer 708 ngr/ml. BIOCHEMISTRY: glucose 163 mg/dl, urea 57 mg/dl, creatinine 0.39 mg/dl, GFR MDRD4; 60 ml/min/1.73m2, sodium 127 mm/l, potassium 4.4 mm/l, magnesium 2.2 mm/l. Creatine kinase 672 U/L. Lactate 2.37 mm/l. Procalcitonin 0.96 ng/ml. Troponin I < 0.01 ng/dl. CK-MB mass 139.93 ng/ml. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.29. pCO2 67 mmHg. pO2 42 mmHg. HCO3 32.2 mm/l. Base excess 3.36 mm/l. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: compatible with multilobar pneumonia (image 2). ECOCARDIOSCOPY: non-dilated left ventricle with preserved function. No segmental alterations of contractility. No aortic valvulopathy. Minimal mitral insufficiency. Right chambers with normal morphology and function. No intracardiac effusion or masses.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The team of intensivists requested a new assessment of the patient due to doubts about the decision taken by cardiology. After re-evaluating the electrocardiograms, a new patient temperature was requested, which was undetectable at the time. The patient was gradually warmed with thermal blankets and warm saline. At 32 °C partial correction of the waves is observed, which disappear completely at 36 °C. A diagnosis of Osborn waves due to hypothermia and acidosis was made. The patient finally died of respiratory failure.  DIAGNOSIS Community-acquired multilobar pneumonia. Acute respiratory failure. Hypothermia and acidosis, with Osborn waves on electrocardiogram. Preserved left ventricular function, no structural heart disease. Death. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient is a 39-year-old male, 170 cm tall and weighing 65 kg. His medical history included Hodgkin's lymphoma at 5 years of age, which required splenectomy, liver and mesenteric lymph node biopsy for staging and was treated with radiotherapy to the thorax. At the age of 34, he underwent haemithroidectomy for follicular adenoma.  Previously asymptomatic and leading an active life, he attended the emergency department for 2 days of general malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, lumbar pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and febrile fever. Laboratory tests showed slight leukocytosis. Abdominal ultrasound and simple thoracic and lumbar radiology revealed no abnormalities. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was diagnosed with low back pain and discharged. Three days later he was urgently admitted for worsening symptoms with shivering, fever of 40 ̊C and hypotension. Blood tests showed 34.8 × 103 leukocytes/μL (92% neutrophils and 15% white blood cells), platelets 465 × 103/μL, ESR of 40 mm, creatinine 1.55 mg/dL, procalcitonin 6.46 ng/mL, C-reactive protein 20.18 mg/dL. Urine sediment showed bacteriuria, 5-10 leucocytes/field and oxalate crystals. Blood and urine cultures were taken. With suspicion of severe sepsis, rescue fluid therapy was administered and antibiotic treatment with meropenem and linezolid was started.  Two days after admission, the patient presented with dyspnoea at rest and pulmonary oedema, probably related to intravenous fluids, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The electrocardiogram showed 2nd degree AV block progressing to complete AV block with output at 70 bpm. The transesophageal echocardiogram showed moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation and a normofunctioning aortic valve, as well as mobile images suggestive of vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet. Dopamine perfusion was started to maintain the heart rate, and antibiotic treatment was modified to include cloxacillin, daptomycin and gentamicin on suspicion of infective endocarditis. The patient's evolution was favourable and allowed extubation 6 days after admission.  Ten days after admission, the patient presented retrosternal pain and signs of sudden onset pericarditis. The echocardiogram showed mild pericardial effusion and progression of endocarditis with vegetations on the anterior mitral leaflet, tricuspid septal leaflet and mitro-aortic junction without significant valvular insufficiencies. Computed tomography angiography showed an aneurysm of probable mycotic origin on the anterior aspect of the ascending aorta as well as a small thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery. The patient was referred for urgent surgery.  After opening the pericardium, the pericardial fluid was bloody in appearance and was sent for culture. Although subjectively appreciated, the aorta, cavae and pulmonary artery appeared to the surgical team to be very small for the size of the patient. A haematoma was noted on the anterior aspect of the aorta and the epicardial fat of the right ventricle. The haematoma was cannulated and then debrided, draining copious pus followed by active arterial bleeding due to possible rupture of the mycotic aneurysm.  Once the extracorporeal circulation was connected and the aorta clamped, the ascending aorta was opened, revealing abundant atheroma plaques, a small mycotic aneurysm with signs of inflammation and a small, thin, competent aortic valve with a 16 mm Hegar ring. Below the aortic valve, vegetation anchored to the membranous septum was observed and resected. After brushing the septum with povidone iodine, a Teflon reinforced stitch was placed because of suspected communication with the right atrium. The portion of the aortic wall including the mycotic aneurysm was resected and direct closure of the aorta was performed respecting the aortic valve. A right atriotomy was performed, revealing a large vegetation in the commissure between the anterior leaflet and the septal leaflet, probably related to the resected vegetation on the left ventricular side. The vegetation was resected, brushed with Betadine and the commissure was reinforced with a stitch. The interatrial septum was then opened and a large vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet was observed and resected. At the end of the operation, a definitive epicardial pacemaker was implanted over the right ventricle.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. Pericardial fluid culture was positive for S. pneumoniae. Although culture of vegetations was negative, DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for S. pneumoniae in all samples.  The patient's postoperative evolution was initially favourable and the echocardiogram showed normally functioning valves with no residual shunts. However, 3 weeks after surgery the patient suffered progressive deterioration of general condition with fever and hypotension. Several blood cultures were positive for Candida orthopsilosis. Despite antifungal treatment, the patient died of septic shock and multi-organ failure 2 months after surgery. Necropsy showed invasive candidiasis in the liver and lung. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is a 63-year-old male with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus on oral antidiabetic treatment, dyslipidaemia and obesity), COPD, chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 1.2 mg/dl and permanent atrial fibrillation, who was admitted to our centre in May 2018 in cardiogenic shock requiring vasoactive support and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient had dilated cardiomyopathy of probable enolic origin, with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%, with implantation of a single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator as primary prevention in 2003.  The admission echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis and double mitral lesion with moderate insufficiency and mild stenosis of probable rheumatic origin with significant calcification of the leaflets. Given the patient's situation and personal history (EuroScore II 19.35%), it was decided to implant a 29 mm Edwards SapienTM transcatheter aortic prosthesis via the transfemoral route by the interventional cardiology team, and percutaneous treatment of the mitral valve was ruled out at the same surgical time. The post-implantation echocardiogram showed a normofunctioning aortic prosthesis with a mean transprosthetic gradient of 5 mm Hg and mitral regurgitation unchanged from the preoperative echocardiogram.  Four months after the procedure the patient was readmitted to our centre for multiple inappropriate shocks of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator, accompanied by fever and chills. We analysed the device data, and observed multiple episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, most of which ended with a shock, and which were undetected by the patient. All episodes were preceded by marked bradycardia requiring pacemaker pacing. Pacemaker pacing was increased to a minimum heart rate of 75 bpm and blood cultures were drawn and tested positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. Given these results, the persistence of fever and elevated acute phase reactants and the history of TAVI implantation, infective endocarditis was suspected and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed. The echocardiogram showed a large hypoechoic vegetation measuring 4.3 × 1.9 cm, with a deflected irregular border extending from 1 cm below the valve plane to 3 cm above the valve plane, filling most of the TAVI stent and causing the prosthesis to behave as a moderate-severe stenosis with a peak gradient of 38 mm Hg without insufficiency. The mitral valve had extensive degenerative changes, with severe calcification of the leaflets and subvalvular apparatus, and a severe central insufficiency jet.  Antibiotic treatment with daptomycin and fosfocimin was started and the case was discussed in a medical-surgical session. Given the lack of clinical and echocardiographic improvement, surgery was decided. During surgery, large vegetations were observed on the ventricular and aortic side of the prosthesis. The TAVI was explanted and an aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm Magna Ease biological aortic prosthesis was performed. In addition, a mitral valve replacement with a 25 mm Magna Ease biological prosthesis was performed.  The explanted prosthesis was analysed microscopically with Gram stain, where gram-positive cocci were observed in clusters, and cultures on the prosthesis were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis.  Subsequently, the patient had a good postoperative evolution, with no associated complications, and was discharged from hospital after completing the 5-week course of antibiotic treatment. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 42-year-old man from China with no past history of interest, who came to the emergency department for an episode of syncope together with general malaise and dysthermia. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of possible septic shock of respiratory origin with bilateral necrotising pneumonia. Imaging tests showed abscesses in the lung, kidney and liver, as well as a thrombus in the inferior vena cava and in the cavo-auricular junction. An echocardiogram was performed, showing a large multilobulated mass with apparent origin in the Eustachian valve. In the first blood cultures and bronchial aspirate Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. Subsequent blood cultures isolated oxacycline-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis. Subsequently, no new microorganisms were isolated, and the rest of the cultures were sterile. The main diagnostic possibilities were myxoma, vegetation and thrombus. Despite antibiotic and anticoagulant treatment, new abscesses and pulmonary lesions continued to appear and echocardiography showed no changes in the mass, so that, given the suspicion of vegetation with/without associated thrombus, complete surgical resection under extracorporeal circulation was decided upon. In order to carry out the intervention with the greatest possible safety for venous drainage, percutaneous cannulation of the femoral vein (progressing the cannula to the inferior vena cava) and cannulation of the superior vena cava were chosen. A right longitudinal atriotomy and temporary release of the inferior vena cava tourniquet was performed for resection of the pedicle implantation base. The resected mass had a pedicle insertion into the Eustachian valve and was approximately 35 × 10 mm in size. As the Eustachian valve was a large and prominent structure, it was resected. No new abscesses or pulmonary lesions appeared after surgery. The microbiological study was sterile, and the histopathological study of the mass was compatible with fibrino-thrombotic material, so anticoagulant treatment was maintained. At the end of the course of intravenous antibiotherapy, the patient was discharged without sequelae and underwent rehabilitation. After 4 months of follow-up he was in functional class I, the control echocardiogram showed no new intracardiac masses and the imaging tests showed resolving pulmonary lesions with no new abscesses. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 72-year-old man with an aortic bioprosthesis implanted in 2010 was diagnosed with prosthetic endocarditis due to Enterococcus faecalis 5 years after surgery. The transesophageal echocardiogram showed an abscess at the level of the mitroaortic junction, 11 mm in diameter, with a 9 mm vegetation attached to the ventricular side of the non-coronary leaflet.  A computed axial tomography (CT) scan revealed a large abscess with gas within it, at the level of the aortic root, extending into the right ventricular outflow tract. Gas bubbles were also present within the pulmonary artery trunk. A positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) confirmed the extension of the infection in both locations.  At surgery, the infected prosthesis was replaced with a cryopreserved aortic valve homograft, sutured subcoronary. Surgical samples were positive for the same microorganism isolated from the blood. No macroscopic involvement of the main pulmonary artery was found. The free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract was explored, and although it was compacted, its puncture did not yield any pathological product, ruling out frank collections at that level.  The postoperative period was uneventful. The control 18F-FDG PET/CT scan showed no evidence of residual gas or significant 18F-FDG uptake. Control blood cultures were similarly negative. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Present illness An asymptomatic patient, while in a shoe shop, suddenly lost consciousness witnessed by his wife without subsequent recovery, so she called the emergency services. On arrival of the first resuscitators (after 5-8 minutes without basic CPR) they observed CPR in a defibrillable rhythm for the AED. S1e administered 2 adrenaline and 4 AED shocks. After advanced life support arrived, the patient persisted in CPR with a shockable rhythm, so a new shock was administered and spontaneous circulation was restored. In the output electrocardiogram (ECG), atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm with ventricular response at 160 bpm with ST elevation in I, aVL and V3-V6. After this, in view of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3 points, orotracheal intubation (OTI) was performed. Contact was made with our cardiology department and, in view of CRA due to shockable rhythm with anterolateral ST elevation, it was decided to transfer the patient directly to the haemodynamics department for emergent coronary angiography, and the hypothermia protocol was initiated. Total time of cardiorespiratory arrest: 20 minutes. Time without assistance: 5-8 minutes.  Physical examination On arrival at hospital: blood pressure (BP) 139/87 mmHg; heart rate (HR) 94 bpm; post-OIOT oxygen saturation 100%; afebrile. GCS 4 points.

Cerebral CT and thoraco-abdominal CT angiography: no significant findings. Transthoracic echocardiogram (in coronary unit): left ventricle (LV) not dilated or hypertrophic with preserved systolic function (LVEF 65%) without alterations in segmental contractility. Diastolic pattern of elongated relaxation (E/E'9). Normal left atrium (20 cm2). Right ventricle (RV) not dilated and with good function. Trivalve aortic valve with preserved opening, without functional alterations. Aortic root not dilated (30 mm). Mitral valve of normal appearance with minimal insufficiency. Tricuspid valve with mild insufficiency. Inferior vena cava not dilated with inspiratory collapse > 50%. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PSAP) of 25 mmHg. No pericardial effusion.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the general cardiology hospital ward: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with preserved global and segmental function (LVEF 62%). Mild-moderate concentric LV hypertrophy (12-13 mm). Non-dilated right ventricle (RV) with preserved global and segmental function (RVEF 63%). In the late enhancement sequences no pathological uptakes were seen. Findings compatible with hypertensive heart disease, with good biventricular function, without pathological enhancements.  Negative for the phenotype of long QT syndrome: standing ECG with normal QTc (440 ms) and stress test with measurement of QTc at the 4th minute of recovery also normal (445 ms). During the stress test, there were no arrhythmic events compatible with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Negative for Brugada syndrome phenotype: modified ECG negative for Brugada pattern in right precordial leads, and negative flecainide test: normal basal sinus rhythm, normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction and normal QRS. The test was negative, although during the pharmacological test with flecainide, the frequent appearance of monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles with right bundle branch block morphology (RBBB) and superior axis, suggestive of origin in the posterior fascicle, drew attention. Finally, with the history of ST elevation in the ECG after the arrest, it was decided to perform an echocardiographic test with ergobasin: clinically, electrically and echocardiographically negative.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the coronary unit after coronary angiography, cerebral-thoracic-abdominal CT and TTE without alterations. After haemodynamic stabilisation with a slow but progressive neurological improvement, and without new arrhythmic events on telemetry, it was decided to transfer him to the general cardiology hospital ward to complete the study with advanced cardiac imaging and provocation tests for channelopathies or coronary vasospasm, the results of which have been detailed previously. The patient remains cardiologically asymptomatic throughout the hospital stay. He was monitored with telemetry, with no recorded arrhythmic events, and daily ECGs were performed, with normal QTc in all of them.  The tests performed during admission ruled out the main causes of cardiac arrest: 1. Ischaemia: normal coronary network in urgent coronary angiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging also showed no pathological ischaemic enhancements. 2. Structural: no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) or cardiac tamponade in emergency echocardiography or CT; no evidence of underlying cardiomyopathy in regular transthoracic echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. 3. Channelopathies: negative provocation tests for long QT syndrome, Brugada, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The baseline ECG also shows no short QTc morphology or early repolarisation pattern. 4. Coronary vasospasm: negative ergobasin echocardiography test. 5. No toxic-metabolic alterations to justify the picture. The patient had no family history of sudden death or early ischaemic heart disease. His father has permanent atrial fibrillation and his mother has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. On discharge, his two children and his sister, all of whom were healthy, were referred to the family heart disease clinic for an ECG and transthoracic echocardiogram. A diagnosis of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation was established. A subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was placed for secondary prevention, and the patient underwent outpatient monitoring in the electrophysiology department.  DIAGNOSIS Out-of-hospital CRA resuscitated by shockable rhythm. Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation: Angiographically normal coronary network. No structural heart disease. Good biventricular function. Pharmacological tests to unmask channelopathy and vasospasm negative. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

She presented with pre-syncopal symptoms in relation to these symptoms, which is why she went to the emergency department. No alterations in bowel habits, no pathological products or blood in the stool. She refers to a trip to Japan 1 month ago, without any notable incident. There was evidence of elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage and the echocardioscopic study showed moderate pericardial effusion, for which reason he was admitted to the coronary unit with suspected myocarditis.

Echocardiogram: On admission: both ventricles of normal diameters and contractility (LVEF 60%, TAPSE 24 mm). Normal diastolic pattern. Normal filling pressures. Normal LA and aorta. Mild mitral anterior leaflet prolapse, without regurgitation. No data of increased PAPs. Moderate pericardial effusion predominantly lateral and apical (maximum 17 mm posterior and 5 mm anterior).

Atria of normal size. Normal diastolic pattern. Absence of significant valvular heart disease. Right ventricle of normal diameters with preserved systolic function. Mild tricuspid regurgitation allowing estimation of a systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 25 mmHg. Normal inferior vena cava. Mild to moderate pericardial effusion of global distribution, predominantly posterior and lateral (posterior 12 mm -especially posteroapical-, lateral 10 mm, anterior 5 mm), without significant functional repercussions (respiratory E wave variation of 12%). Cardio-MRI: non-dilated left ventricle (IVTDVI: 65 ml/m2), without hypertrophy or remodelling (61 g/m2), with preserved systolic function and EF calculated by Simpson of 56%. Non-dilated right ventricle (IVTDVD: 92 ml/m2) with good systolic function and an EF calculated by Simpson of 65%. Normal atria. T2-weighted sequences showed oedema in the apex. Perfusion sequences show a slight delay of perfusion in the apex. Mild to moderate pericardial effusion predominantly in the lateral aspect of the left ventricle with a maximum end-diastolic thickness of 18 mm. Late transmural gadolinium enhancement in the apex (segment 17). Intraventricular thrombus is seen in the area of transmural enhancement.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his stay in the coronary unit, hypereosinophilia secondary to nasosinusal polyposis (ASA triad syndrome) was noted, which was present in most of the analytical controls prior to the clinical picture. Haematology was contacted and ruled out monoclonal expansion and alteration of fusion genes (tyrosine kinase). Cardio-MRI was performed, showing findings compatible with eosinophilic endomyocarditis (or Loeffler's) with intraventricular thrombus, so treatment was started with methylprenisolone 1g IV and later changed to prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, with a gradual decrease in eosinophil numbers and pericardial effusion. In addition, enoxaparin was started at an anticoagulant dose. Within hours of enoxaparin administration, the patient presented a reaction consisting of erythematous exanthema with central clearing involving both inguinal flexures, which was categorised by dermatology as SDRIFE (symmetric drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema) attenuated by corticosteroids, recommending the replacement of enoxaparin with bemiparin. Subsequent echocardiography showed a reduction in pericardial effusion, located mainly at the posterolateral level, which did not require drainage. Given the favourable response and compatible findings in cardio-MRI with idiopathic hypereosinophilic hypereosinophilic syndrome with cardiac involvement (eosinophilic endomyocarditis), endomyocardial endomyocarditis was rejected for confirmation given the invasiveness of this test and the limited experience in our centre. Troponin I levels plateaued at 6,000 ng/l for the first 6 days and subsequently decreased to normal. During his stay in the coronary unit he remained haemodynamically stable, with no arrhythmic events and resolution of flu-like symptoms (arthromyalgia, fever, etc.). After transfer to the cardiology ward, he presented adequate tolerance to ambulation and remained asymptomatic, so he was discharged home with therapeutic adjustment and follow-up in outpatient clinics.  Treatment on discharge: Bemiparin 10,000 IU subcutaneous daily as a bridge to acenocoumarol. Acenocoumarol according to guideline. Prednisone 110 mg orally in the morning and after 4 weeks reduce the dose by 10 mg and then reduce by 10 mg every 3 weeks to a maintenance dose of 5-10 mg for 6 months. Omeprazole 40 mg 1 tablet per day. Calcium supplement 500 mg every 12 hours.  DIAGNOSIS Eosinophilic or Loeffler's endocarditis. Intraventricular thrombus. Hypereosinophilic syndrome. ASA triad. Enoxaparin toxicoderma (SDRIFE). Prostatic adenocarcinoma. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Young 19-year-old male Family history: paternal grandfather died at an advanced age due to massive pulmonary thromboembolism. Father and mother without thrombosis. Mother without miscarriages. No known drug allergies. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome: diagnosed after an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 2017. High-risk serological profile: triple antibody positivity (AL + aCL + Antiβ2-GPI positive). Active smoker of 3-5 cigarettes/day. No surgical history. Usual treatment: acenocoumarol.  Present illness A 19-year-old male presented to the emergency department for oppressive central thoracic pain with associated vegetative crusade of 3 hours' duration that started during exercise and did not subside with rest. It did not radiate, did not change with movement or breathing, no palpitations, dyspnoea or infectious symptoms. He admits not having taken the dose of acenocoumarol for the previous 5 days for fear of its interaction with alcohol, which he had consumed.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 130/85 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 65 bpm. Basal oxygen saturation 99%. Respiratory rate 16 rpm. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. Afebrile. Sweating. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, without added sounds. Lower extremities without oedema or signs of DVT.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Emergency ECG: Sinus bradycardia at 55 bpm. Normal PR. Narrow QRS with normal axis. ST elevation of 3-4 mm in DII, DIII and aVF and 1-1.5 mm in V5-V6, specular ST descent in DI and aVL. Laboratory tests: INR on arrival 1.1. Haemoglobin 15.6 g/dl, leukocytes 11,040 /μl, platelets 177,000 /μl. Troponin I (hs-TnI normal range 0-53.5) initial 5,122.3, peak 116,052.8 ng/l, HbA1C 5.5%, total cholesterol 136 mg/dl, HDL 37 mg/dl, LDL 62 mg/dl, triglycerides 188 mg/dl, creatinine 0.86 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate > 90 ml/min, sodium 136 mmol/l, potassium 3.5 mmol/l, TSH 1 μIU/ml, iron profile normal. Emergent coronary catheterisation: right radial access. Truncus: no lesions. Anterior descending coronary artery (AD): normal development, no angiographic lesions. Circumflex coronary artery (Cx): no angiographic lesions. Right coronary artery (RCA): dominant, complete thrombotic occlusion in the middle segment. Percutaneous coronary interventionism (PCI): guidewire is advanced to the distal RCA and several thrombus aspirations are performed, obtaining abundant red thrombus. TIMI 3 flow was recovered and a long lesion was observed with slight stenosis and remnants of thrombus in the mid-distal DC. Distal bed of good development and without lesions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed, which showed remains of red thrombus adhered to the wall, without images suggestive of plaque rupture, in a vessel with no signs of atherosclerosis, although at some points the arterial wall was not visible due to the presence of thrombus. In view of these findings, it was decided not to implant a stent. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle not dilated or hypertrophic, with normal overall systolic function (LVEF by Simpson biplane of 54%). Akinesia of medial and basal segments of inferior and inferolateral face. E/E' ratio of 7.5. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Atria of normal size. Mild mitral insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating a PSAP of 35 mmHg. Normal aortic root and ascending aorta. No pericardial effusion. ECG at discharge: sinus rhythm at 75 bpm. Normal PR. Narrow QRS with Q wave and negative T waves in inferior (DII, DIII, aVF) and lateral (V4-V6).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival, an electrocardiogram was performed showing ST elevation and the haemodynamic alert was activated for emergent coronary catheterisation. Thrombotic occlusion was observed in the right coronary artery, and thromboaspiration and balloon angioplasty were performed, recovering TIMI 3 flow. Intracoronary imaging with OCT was performed with visualisation of residual red thrombus adhered to the wall, with no evidence of plaque rupture or atherosclerosis. In view of these findings, it was decided not to implant a stent. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed with normal global function and segmental alteration in the DC territory. Double antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation were started. The patient remained monitored during admission, stable, reintroducing oral anticoagulation, with no complications of renal function or radial puncture. Since this was a thrombotic event, in the context of incorrect anticoagulation and with coronary arteries without lesions, it was decided to maintain anticoagulation and indefinite statins together with antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid for one month. On discharge, the patient was referred to the cardiac rehabilitation programme. A coronary CT scan at 2 months showed epicardial coronary arteries without lesions.

Lives with her parents. Separated. No known drug allergies. No family history of heart disease or early sudden cardiac death. No toxic habits. No cardiovascular risk factors. Normal weight (weight 57.5 kg, height 1.58 m). Mitochondrial cytopathy phenotype MELAS (diagnosis at 23 years of age). Predominance of severe sensorineural deafness and exercise intolerance due to myopathy. On treatment with valproate and phenobarbital, with last complex tonic comical seizure 1 year ago. CT scan with no new lesions. Frequent hyponatremia. Right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock. Surgical interventions: cholecystectomy (2012) and appendectomy in childhood. Usual medication: valproate 500 mg 1-1-1, phenobarbital 50 mg 0-0-1, ubiquinone 100 mg 0-1-0, lorazepam 1 mg 0-0-0-1.  Present illness Anamnesis through the family for aphasia and severe hypoacusis of the patient. They report that on waking up in the morning she is pale with sweating and nausea. Subsequently, dizziness intensified, falling to the floor with loss of consciousness and rapid recovery.  The emergency service was called, but the clinical manifestations persisted on arrival, revealing a 2:1 AVB, conducted heartbeat with morphology of left bundle branch block. She was referred to the regional hospital, being asymptomatic on arrival and with ECG in sinus rhythm with AV conduction 1:1. No chest pain, palpitations, dyspnoea or other accompanying symptoms. She was referred to our centre for cardiology assessment.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 92/62 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 72 bpm, SatO99%, temperature 35 oC. Conscious and oriented. No neurological focality. Rhythmic tones, no murmurs or rubs. Symmetrical pulses. No jugular ingurgitation. No oedema. Good bilateral air entry, no extra sounds. Abdomen soft, slight distension at epigastric level, not painful on palpation. Peristalsis preserved.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS First ECG (performed by the emergency service at the first medical contact): BAV 2:1 at 35 bpm, conducted beat with QRS of 110 msec with short PR of 100 msec and electrical image compatible with negative delta wave in V1, positive in V3-V6, II, III, aVF. ECG on admission to our centre: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, AV conduction 1:1 PR 100 ms and QRS of 110 msec with image compatible with pre-excitation, similar to the previous one. Posteroanterior chest X-ray performed in the emergency room of our centre: normal cardiac silhouette. No condensation in the lung parenchyma. No signs of heart failure or pleural effusion. Initial blood tests: glucose 305 mg/dl, creatinine 0.8 mg/dl (GFR > 90 ml/min), urea 61 mmol/l, CK 328 mU/ml, TnUs 61 ng/l, Na 130 mEq/l (corrected 136 mEq/l), K 4.6 mEq/l. Haemogram: leucocytes 13.1x109 l (N 53.1%, L 37.3%), haemoglobin 12.1 g/dl, haematocrit 36%, platelets 217 x109 l, INR 0.98. Venous blood gas on admission: pH 7.231, pCO2 40.7 mmHg, HCO3 15.5 mEq/L, EB -10.5 mEq/L, lactate 8.6 mEq/l. Control blood test 5 hours after admission: CK 292 mU/ml, troponin I US 100 ng/l, lactate 4.4m Eq/l. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle, slightly concentrically hypertrophied, with normal systolic diastolic function. No significant valvulopathies. Mild pulmonary hypertension (estimated PAPs 36-38 mmHg). Normal right ventricle.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION A 47-year-old woman with MELAS syndrome was admitted for symptomatic (syncopal) 2:1 AVB and with an image compatible with pre-excitation that persisted despite the conduction disorder, leading to the diagnosis of an associated fasciculoventricular accessory pathway (origin posterior to the atrioventricular node). The echocardiogram showed mild ventricular hypertrophy with slightly elevated PSAP. Laboratory tests showed initial lactate of 8 mEq/l and later 4 mEq/l, with slight initial acidosis that remained with slightly elevated lactate and was attributed to mitochondrial disease (previous lactate always elevated 2.5-11). Admitted to the coronary unit for close monitoring and implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Favourable evolution since admission, remaining asymptomatic at all times, in sinus rhythm with 1:1 AV conduction, with no recurrence of bradyarrhythmia. Twenty-four hours after admission, a bicameral pacemaker was implanted without incident and subsequently, after verifying the normal functioning of the device and the absence of complications, she was discharged home.  DIAGNOSIS Symptomatic 2:1 AV block (syncopal). Electrocardiographic image compatible with ventricular pre-excitation by a fasciculoventricular accessory pathway (considering persistence of QRS morphology despite AVB). MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

No evidence of ventricular thrombus. No valvular heart disease. No pericardial effusion. Consultation with the medical oncology service: chemotherapy was suspended due to its association with arterial thrombotic events. Ipsilateral radiotherapy was proposed as an alternative treatment. ECG at discharge: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. Normal PR. No pathological Q waves. Narrow QRS with normal axis, without repolarisation alterations.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION 37-year-old male smoker and dyslipidaemic, with a history of testicular seminoma and active treatment with chemotherapy (cisplatin + etoposide) with the last dose administered 8 days before admission. He was admitted for chest pain with mobilisation of markers of myocardial damage without changes in the ECG, and it was decided to admit him as an acute myocardial infarction without ST segment elevation (STEMI), postulating a possible relationship with his pathology or oncological treatment. Treatment was started with anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin and double antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel. On admission, coronary angiography showed an organised thrombus in the middle segment of the LAD with a stenosis of 60%. Given this history, conservative management was decided, initially with tirofiban perfusion for 24 hours and then a change to ticagrelor together with ASA and anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (triple antithrombotic therapy), with the idea of repeating the coronary angiography and trying to avoid stent implantation. After a week of treatment, the coronary angiography was repeated and showed disappearance of the previous thrombus, with no significant underlying lesions in the three vessels, and anticoagulant treatment was then suspended. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed preserved LVEF. Good clinical evolution: asymptomatic, haemodynamically stable and with troponins in decline. Finally, he was discharged home to continue medical treatment with double platelet antiplatelet therapy with ASA and ticagrelor. From the point of view of his testicular cancer, an assessment was requested from medical oncology, who decided to suspend chemotherapy treatment due to the relationship of cisplatin with acute coronary thrombotic events, proposing a change to radiotherapy (outpatient) and follow-up on his part.  DIAGNOSIS STEMI. Acute anterior descending thrombosis secondary to treatment with cisplatin, resolved after one week of triple antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation. Coronary arteries without underlying atherosclerotic lesions. Preserved LVEF. Classic stage IIA seminoma with active chemotherapy treatment (cisplatin + etoposide), which was discontinued. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Personal history Male patient aged 28 years. No known allergic reactions to medication. No cardiovascular risk factors. No known consumption of toxic substances. Cardiological history: no known heart disease. No other relevant pathologies. Family history: paternal uncle suffered from colorectal cancer at the age of 58. No other family history of interest. He does not take treatments on a regular basis.  Current illness Patient presented to the emergency department for sudden loss of consciousness while watching a football match. He did not present chest pain before or after the episode, but did report an abrupt onset of palpitations at a high frequency in the moments prior to the event. He reported some previous general malaise, but denied fever or infectious symptoms. He denied the use of drugs or toxic substances. The observers did not describe shaking or signs attributable to neurological focality. The patient's memory of the moments after regaining consciousness was preserved. During his transfer to out-of-hospital medical services, he presented a new episode of loss of consciousness, at which time the electrocardiographic recording showed a rhythm compatible with ventricular fibrillation, which resolved after 2 shocks at 100 J, restoring sinus rhythm.  Physical examination Temperature 36o C; blood pressure 159/83 mmHg; heart rate 86 bpm; O2 saturation 97% without contributions. No signs of tachypnoea at rest. Neurological examination without alterations. Cardiac auscultation was rhythmic, without murmurs and pulmonary auscultation without pathological sounds. Abdominal examination showed no palpable organomegaly, hepatojugular reflux was negative. The lower limbs were free of oedema and there were no signs of deep vein thrombosis. Pulses were strong and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests in the ED: leukocytes 8300 /ml, haemoglobin 15.3 g/dl; platelets 235000 u/l. No coagulation alterations; basal glucose 108 mg/dl; urea 43 mg/dl; creatinine 0.67 mg/dl; estimated glomerular filtration rate (MDRD-4) 97 ml/min/1.73 m2; total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl; GOT 22 IU/l; CPK 107 IU/l; Na 136 mmol/l; potassium 4.4 mmol/l; corrected calcium 9.5 mg/dl; magnesium 2 mg/dl; urine toxins/drugs of abuse: negative. Out-of-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) during loss of consciousness: ventricular fibrillation rhythm evidenced during out-of-hospital monitoring. Baseline 12-lead surface ECG: sinus rhythm without pre-excitation or atrioventricular (AV) conduction block. QRS with Ic-oved type Brugada pattern morphology. A right bundle branch block morphology with rsR" complex is observed, which continues with a descending ST that crosses the isoelectric line to continue with a negative T. The corrected QT interval is normal. The corrected QT interval is normal. As the electrostatic positioning is moved up one intercostal space the pattern becomes more evident. Urgent transthoracic echocardiogram: preserved systolic function, without alterations of segmental contractility. Chambers neither dilated nor hypertrophic. Tricuspid aortic valve with no remarkable valvulopathy. Normally functioning mitral valve. No other significant valvulopathies were observed. No pericardial effusion. Inferior vena cava not dilated, with adequate inspiratory collapsibility. Conclusion: study within normal parameters Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI study with anatomical sequences in the axial plane enhanced in T1 and T2, cine sequences in short axis, four chambers and right ventricular outflow tract (RV) and, finally, late enhancement in short axis and four chambers. Anatomical assessment: cavities neither hypertrophic nor dilated, within normal limits: left atrium 58 x 20 mm; right atrium 52 x 46 mm; left ventricle 55 x 98 mm; right ventricle 42 x 88 mm. Interventricular septum 9 mm with free wall 7 mm. Right ventricle wall 3 mm. No contractility alterations were observed. No oedema is seen in the T2 sequences. No late enhancement after gadolinium administration. There was no pericardial effusion. In the functional study the following parameters were found: left ventricular ejection fraction 58.8%; stroke volume 104.3 ml; cardiac output 5.5 l/min; end-diastolic volume 177.5 ml; end-systolic volume 73.2 ml. Conclusion: no pathological findings. Study not suggestive of structural cardiomyopathy (video 1). Genetic study: channelopathies panel. Missense mutation in geSnCN5. Sequence NM_198056. Nucleotide change G298S.    CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the cardiology department for study of underlying heart disease and intensive monitoring with the option of defibrillation. A morphological study was performed with transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (video 1). After completing a study that ruled out other heart disease and after the surface ECG of one of the daily controls showed a spontaneous Brugada pattern type 1 (shark fin), the patient was diagnosed with Brugada syndrome and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was indicated for secondary prevention. As this was the first known event, hygienic-dietary and lifestyle recommendations were made, but no further treatment was indicated. During follow-up, with quarterly reviews of the device, asymptomatic low-density ventricular extrasystoles were detected, and beta-blocker treatment with carvedilol 6.25 mg daily was started. A genetic study was performed for family counselling (presenting a missense mutation in the SCN5 gene) and clinical assessment of the family, in which the father was found to be a carrier of the mutation, although with an anodyne surface ECG and negative provocation test. The mother had a type 2 electrocardiographic pattern, although the provocation test and genetic study were negative. At subsequent follow-up, at 7 months, she presented a new syncopal episode with appropriate discharge of the device due to the presence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) with a 180 ms cycle apparently triggered by ventricular extrasystole with right ventricular outflow tract morphology. A new morphological study was performed, which was anodyne, exogenous precipitants were ruled out (drugs, toxins, metabolic alterations, etc.) and it was proposed to start treatment with quinidine, which the patient refused. The dose of carvedilol was increased to 12.5 mg daily. Outpatient follow-up continued when, after 7 months, he presented another episode with 2 shocks due to ventricular fibrillation with similar characteristics to those previously described. Treatment was then started with quinidine at a dose of 200 mg every 6 hours. After 13 months of treatment with quinidine, the patient had no new shocks or events during follow-up.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 93 bpm. PR 120 ms. QRS 60 ms. QTc 398ms. No repolarisation alterations. CBC: haemoglobin 20 g/dl, haematocrit 62%, platelets 144,000 /μl, leukocytes 7400/μl. Erythropoietin 7.71 mlU/ml (2.59-18.5). International normalised ratio (INR) 1.05. Basal glycaemia 82 mg/dl. Urea 36 mg/dl, creatinine 0.81 mg/dl, sodium 137 mEq/l, potassium 4.1 mEq/l. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.42, pCO2 35 mmHg, pO2 41 mmHg, HCO3 22.7, SpO2 70.7%, lactate 1 mmol/l. Chest X-ray: cardiomediastinal silhouette centred. Cardiothoracic index (CTI) less than 0.5. Translucent lung fields without pleural effusion or condensation. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram: transesophageal examination (without sedation due to baseline hypoxaemia): atrial septal defect without significant residual shunt (minimal shunt at the level of the pericardial patch without any functional repercussions). Left ventricle with preserved diameters, volumes and global systolic function. No alterations in segmental contractility were observed. No significant valvulopathies. Left ventricular diastolic pattern within normality. Right ventricle of normal diameters with preserved global systolic function. Mild tricuspid insufficiency allowing PAPs 20-25 mmHg to be quantified. Normal inferior vena cava. Sinus rhythm. Injection of gelafundin shows no bubble passage to left cavities when administered in both upper limbs. Angio-CT: no evidence of repletion defects in main, lobar, segmental or sub-segmental pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). No signs of pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary infarcts. No pulmonary nodules or pulmonary consolidations are evident. No pleural or pericardial effusion. No bone lesions suggestive of malignancy. No other relevant findings by this technique. Ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy: scintigraphic study with no perfusion or ventilation defects. Spirometry: discrete pulmonary restriction, with normal diffusion. Cardiac magnetic resonance: left ventricle (LV) with small volumes (LVOT 38 ml/m, STV 13 ml/m, LVMI 35 g/m) without significant hypertrophy of its walls or alterations of segmental contractility at rest and with preserved global systolic function (GSF) (LVEF 66%). Non-dilated right ventricle (RV) (RVOT 14 ml/m, STV 5 ml/m) with preserved global systolic function (LVEF 62%). Aorta and great vessels of normal diameter and morphology. Atria of normal dimensions. QP/QS (1.4/4.1)= 0.34, indicative of right left shunt. Gadoteric acid (0.15 mM/kg) was administered for 3D vascular study: aorta and pulmonary trunk with normal diameters and morphology. Abnormal systemic drainage is observed with drainage of the inferior vena cava into the left atrium (LA). Normal pulmonary vein drainage. Necrosis and viability study: absence of myocardial LGE suggestive of necrosis/fibrosis. Conclusion: anomalous systemic drainage with inferior vena cava draining into the LA with QP/QS of 0.34 (indicative of left right shunt) with LV and RV volumes and preserved GSF.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the clinical suspicion of a residual right-to-left shunt, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were initially requested to try to confirm the diagnosis. Both studies demonstrated normal biventricular function without associated pulmonary hypertension. Contrast was administered through both upper limbs with no evidence of bubble passage to the left cavities. Continuing with the diagnostic process, a pulmonary CT scan and a ventilation/perfusion scan were performed, both with normal results. However, given the high clinical suspicion, it was decided to conclude the study with a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in which an anomalous drainage of the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the left atrium was observed. In view of these findings, an anatomical correction of the anomalous IVC drainage was performed. During the operation, a repaired atrial septal defect (ASD) located in the lower portion of the atrial septum was observed, with a prominent Eustachian valve and an erroneous suture causing drainage of the IVC into the left atrium (LA). In the absence of postoperative complications, the patient was discharged and remained asymptomatic with normal arterial blood gases and echocardiography.  DIAGNOSIS Anomalous drainage of the inferior vena cava in the left atrium after surgical repair of atrial septal defect. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION This is a 37-year-old female patient, with no family or personal history of interest, except for smoking (pack-year index: 15), which was her only known cardiovascular risk factor. He had been under cardiology consultation for 20 years due to palpitations. These symptoms corresponded to frequent monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles with an extrasystolic load of up to 20% and non-sustained ventricular tachycardias of up to 8-10 complexes, without echocardiographic or cardiac MRI evidence of structural heart disease, gadolinium enhancement or deterioration of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). He had recently undergone a coronary CT scan with a calcium score of 0 points and coronary artery disease was ruled out by non-invasive coronary angiography. During this period, several attempts were made to initiate antiarrhythmic treatment (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, amiodarone and flecainide), which he was unable to tolerate due to marked asthenia, dizziness and hypotension. Since the summer of 2019, she has presented clinical deterioration that she refers to as increased palpitations, mainly on exertion and limitation of physical activity, without associated chest pain and without a clear increase in functional class, orthopnoea or oedematisation of the lower limbs. He has never presented with syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  At the first consultation (September 2019), a new attempt was made to start beta-blockers at low doses (nebivolol 1.25 mg/24 h) and she was assessed again in consultation 3 weeks after starting treatment with transthoracic echocardiography, ergometry and Holter-ECG.  Physical examination in consultation: good general condition, blood pressure 95/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80 bpm. Baseline SpO2 99%. Afebrile. Head and neck: no jugular venous engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic sounds at 75 bpm without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normoventilation in all fields Abdomen: nondescript. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Initial electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, isolated supraventricular extrasystoles. Ventricular extrasystoles with right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology, inferior axis and V1-V2 transition. Holter ECG (under treatment with nebivolol 1.25 mg/24 h): sinus rhythm throughout the tracing with adequate heart rates (mean 65, maximum 130 and min 45 bpm). Frequent monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles (extrasystolic load 17.2% (previous load 12%), sometimes grouped in the form of ventricular bigeminy and 2 short bursts of up to 9 complexes (coinciding with the time of physical activity reported by the patient between 13 and 14 h). Very isolated supraventricular extrasystoles. No significant bradycardias or pauses. Conventional ergometry: Bruce protocol on treadmill: stopped at the beginning of stage 4, at 9 min 34 of exercise due to physical fatigue, reaching 165 bpm (90% of maximum theoretical HR). No clinical signs suggestive of angina. 12.3 METS, good functional capacity for age and sex. No alterations in the ST. Adequate blood pressure behaviour. Monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles throughout the recording, which became more frequent during maximum effort and early recovery by means of ventricular trigeminy. Isolated ventricular doublet without VT. Conclusion: ventricular extrasystoles more frequent during maximal exercise without complex forms. Clinically and electrically negative for ischaemia.  Transthoracic echocardiogram: left atrium not dilated. Normal mitral valve. Minimal central insufficiency. Normal filling pressures. Left ventricle not dilated (VTDVI 4C 114 cm, VTSVI 4C 44 cm), nor hypertrophied. Biplane LVEF 59.7% without segmental alterations. Trivalve aortic valve, normal flow. Aortic root not dilated. Non dilated right chambers with normal contractility (TAPSE 28). Tricuspid valve with normal flow. No indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion.  Blood analysis: no alterations, including normal TSH. Electrophysiological study (images 3-6 and video 2): double right femoral venous puncture. Introduction of a decapolar diagnostic catheter in the coronary sinus and tetrapolar to His-VD. Pacing protocol was performed from the base of the RV at two frequencies and two extras, basal and under isoproterol perfusion without inducing tachycardia, although extras appeared spontaneously. Right femoral arterial puncture and introduction of Orion catheter. The Rhythmia® system was used to map LVOT and aortic sinuses first (surface ECG with ventricular extrasystoles at the BRD and inferior axis, r wave in V1-V2 and V2 transition). Subsequent RVOT mapping. The best precocities (24 ms) are found with respect to QRS onset between the left and right aortic sinus, with fragmented bipolar electrogram and unipolar qs. Pacemapping was performed from the theoretical ablation point, obtaining ventricular complexes that were 98% concordant with the mapped extrasystole. After verifying by electroanatomical integration with previous coronary CT a distance > 6 mm (14 mm) with respect to the LMCA ostium, and absence of proximity to His, radiofrequency ablation was performed (40 W, 48o C) with a gold-tipped irrigated catheter at that point, and the extrasystoles disappeared after the third second of the single application. After 10 min after ablation, the pacing protocol was repeated without the appearance of extrasystoles.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION At the next consultation (October 2019), the patient reported withdrawal of medication due to orthostatism and marked asthenia. The results of the tests requested in the previous consultation highlighted an increase in extrasystolic load in Holter-ECG (17.2%, which was 5% more than in the previous one) with very brief and isolated bouts of ventricular tachycardia (VT), without deterioration of systolic function in echocardiography. Given the evolution of our patient, and in accordance with her preferences, an electrophysiological study was proposed. We explained in detail the suspected left origin of the extrasystoles, probably in the region of the LV outflow tract or aortic cusps, and the risks derived both from the approach and from a possible ablation in this region, which she accepted. An electrophysiological study (November 2019) revealed the left origin of the extrasystoles, specifically between the left and right aortic cusps. After checking the safety distance with respect to His and aostium of the coronary arteries, radiofrequency was applied in this region, which was successful, achieving the disappearance of the arrhythmia. After verifying the absence of post-procedural complications, the patient was discharged after 24 hours. Since then, she has visited us twice, reporting a very significant clinical improvement. In the control Holter-ECG only very isolated ventricular extrasystoles were recorded (150 VE in 24 h), so she is not currently receiving any antiarrhythmic treatment.  DIAGNOSIS Frequent ventricular extrasystoles originating in the left ventricular outflow tract. Electrophysiological study --> successful ablation of the extrasystolic focus. Absence of structural heart disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Background 27-year-old male, student and candidate for the state security forces. Athletic build, with no known toxic habits or metabolic disorders.  Cardiological history: No cardiological history of interest, no family history of heart disease or sudden death.  Other history: Infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction T2N2, diagnosed after anaemia study five months before the episode. Treated by laparoscopic rectosigmoidectomy one month after diagnosis. Currently on chemotherapy treatment with oxaliplatin and capecitabine, having received a first cycle 15 days before the cardiorespiratory arrest. Stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis, diagnosed four months before the episode, following extension studies of the rectal neoplasia. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy of paratracheal adenopathy and untreated at the time of cardiorespiratory arrest. No other medical treatment apart from chemotherapy (oxaliplatin and capecitabine, having received a first cycle 15 days ago).  Current illness The patient suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest during a football match. On arrival of the emergency services, advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started and the patient presented with a shockable rhythm of ventricular fibrillation. After two shocks and a single dose of adrenaline, the patient regained rhythm and was transferred to our hospital under orotracheal intubation (OTI) and mechanical ventilation. When the patient was questioned during his stay on the ward, he reported having no memory of the episode. He denied any clinical manifestations prior to the cardiorespiratory arrest. He also reported no previous symptoms of angina, dyspnoea or syncope and maintained his usual NYHA I/IV functional class without any symptoms of heart failure.  Physical examination The first examination was performed on arrival at the emergency critical care ward of our hospital, with the patient sedated, relaxed and on invasive ventilation and OTI. The temperature was 36.8oC; heart rate 100 bpm; blood pressure 105/67 mmHg; saturation 100% (OTI). He is well hydrated, skin warm and well perfused. Rhythmic heart sounds without over-additions. Bladder murmur preserved with symmetrical ventilation in both hemithoraxes and no over-added sounds. Abdomen with a recent laparoscopic scar of good appearance. Soft, with no palpable masses or megaliths. No defence on palpation. Extremities well perfused, pulses present and symmetrical. No signs of oedema or venous thrombosis.

Urine system and urine sediment: normal. 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (cardiorespiratory arrest rhythm): ventricular fibrillation. 12-lead ECG (arrival at the hospital emergency room): sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm. P wave of normal size and duration. Normal PR segment. Narrow QRS complex, axis at 60o and transition in V3 in precordial leads. ST segment without suprathreshold. Negative T wave in lateral leads (V6, I and aVL) and in inferior face (II and aVF).  Chest X-ray: cardiac silhouette of normal size. Mediastinal enlargement with bilateral hilar adenopathies without tracheal deviation or compression. Endotracheal tube 2 cm above the tracheal carina. No vascular redistribution, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Distended gastric chamber. Transthoracic echocardiogram: normal sized atria. Left ventricle (LV) slightly dilated with normal thickness, normal global and segmental systolic function (LVEF 60%), normal left ventricular filling pressures. Right ventricle of normal size, preserved systolic function (TAPSE 31 mm). Normally functioning atrioventricular valves with no evidence of stenosis or insufficiency. Thin trivalve aortic valve, normal function. Pulmonary valve without stenosis, with mild pulmonary insufficiency. No pericardial effusion. Normal flow in descending aorta and abdominal aorta. Computed tomography (CT) coronary arteries: epicardial arteries without lesions or congenital anatomical alterations. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): left ventricle slightly dilated (TVD 118 ml/m2 and STV 49 ml/m2), normal myocardial mass (104 g/m2) without contractility alterations and with normal systolic function (EF 58%). No areas of hypertrophy or non-compaction are seen. No hyperintense areas suggestive of intramyocardial oedema are seen in the STIR sequence. Several areas of intramural late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) are seen in the basal anteroseptal segment and in the inferior junction of both ventricles compatible with areas of intramyocardial scarring. Right ventricle of normal size, with preserved systolic function. Left atrium slightly dilated (22 cm2) and right atrium of normal size. Aorta, pulmonary artery and pericardium without alterations. Positron emission tomography with 18F-deoxyglucose (PET): multiple hypermetabolic adenopathies located in supraclavicular, mediastinal and hilar compartments compatible with confirmed stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis. No hypermetabolic pathological foci in the myocardium suspicious of acute sarcoidotic or other inflammatory involvement. The rest of the study showed no findings of interest.  CLINICAL COURSE A 27-year-old man who presented with out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest due to recovered ventricular fibrillation. The patient was admitted intubated to the cardiac intensive care unit where he remained for 4 days and was extubated in the first 24 hours. He was subsequently transferred to the cardiology ward to complete the studies. Throughout his stay, he remained asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view, with no rhythm alterations detected on telemetry. The aforementioned studies were performed in order to reach a diagnosis and guide treatment. Initially, many diagnostic options were considered as possible aetiologies for ventricular fibrillation: ischaemic heart disease, ventricular arrhythmias in a structurally healthy heart or even the possibility of cardiac toxicity due to chemotherapy treatment. After the initial echocardiographic study, CT of the coronary arteries and the subsequent CMR study, the presence of intramyocardial fibrosis was confirmed. This finding, together with the episode of ventricular fibrillation and the previous diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis (by biopsy) confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and thus the cause of cardiorespiratory arrest.  In the absence of data of acute inflammatory activity in the CMR, and with a view to assessing possible anti-inflammatory treatment, it was decided to complete studies with PET-CT, which again ruled out the presence of intramyocardial inflammatory activity.  For this reason, in agreement with the autoimmune unit of the internal medicine department, anti-inflammatory treatment was finally rejected and a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted for secondary prevention of sudden death. To date, the patient remains stable and without new arrhythmic events.  DIAGNOSIS Out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. Cardiac sarcoidosis with intramyocardial scarring but no evidence of active intramyocardial inflammation. Left ventricular systolic function preserved. Coronary arteries without lesions or coronary anomalies. Subcutaneous ICD implantation for secondary prevention. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 58-year-old male patient, a high-intensity sportsman, with an electrocardiogram (ECG) compatible with left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggestive of athlete's heart. Subsequent follow-up in the arrhythmia unit following an episode of flutter, with persistence of the electrocardiographic alterations described.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No family history of heart disease or early sudden death. Active high-intensity sportsman (cyclist, cycling about 100 km per day). Allergy to acetylsalicylic acid. Ex-smoker of half a pack/day until 4 years ago. Non-drinker. High blood pressure (HBP) under treatment with good control as usual. No known diabetes mellitus (DM) or dyslipidaemia (DLP). Admission to cardiology in February 2016 due to chest pain with atypical characteristics for ischaemic heart disease associated with hypertensive crisis, ECG with negative inferolateral T findings and echocardiogram with preserved LVEF, without segmental alterations of contractility and concentric ventricular hypertrophy (IVS 15 mm, PIL 15 mm), without intraventricular dynamic gradient. Ergometry was performed with negative results for myocardial ischaemia and ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac MRI was requested on discharge to complete the study, which was performed at another centre due to lack of availability at our centre, with the finding of maximum thickness at the level of the basal septum of 12 mm (upper limit of normality), with the rest of the segments with preserved thicknesses and without late enhancement, classifying it as an athlete's heart. Episode of palpitations in May 2018, ECG in the emergency department compatible with paroxysmal counterclockwise atrial flutter. Programmed electrical cardioversion was performed after anticoagulation for 3 weeks, and the patient went into sinus rhythm. In September 2018, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation (CTI) was performed with the CARTO system without the use of scopy. Subsequent follow-up in the arrhythmia unit showed that the patient remained asymptomatic and in sinus rhythm, with persistent negative inferolateral T-segments and concentric hypertrophy on serial echocardiograms. The patient was instructed to cease high-intensity exercise for further re-evaluation. No surgical interventions of interest.  Usual treatment: Ramipril 2.5 mg one tablet at breakfast.  Current illness The patient was reviewed at the arrhythmia clinic after having stopped all physical exercise for the last 8 months. The patient remains asymptomatic, with no new episodes of palpitations. He denied exertional dyspnoea, syncope or other symptoms. An ECG was performed in consultation, with persistence of left ventricular hypertrophy criteria together with deep and asymmetrical negative T in precordial leads and inferior face. An echocardiogram was performed, with the finding of mild-moderate concentric hypertrophy of its walls (IVS 13 mm, LIP 11 mm) but with the presence at the apical level of a greater myocardial thickness of about 15-16 mm, with systolic closure in "ace of spades" morphology with slight hypokinesia of the most apical segments. No SAM or intraventricular gradient was observed. Given the electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings after stopping exercise, despite the patient having a cardiac MRI 3 years earlier compatible with athlete's heart and without findings compatible with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, it was decided to request a new cardiac MRI to complete the study.  Physical examination Acceptable general condition. Eupneic at rest. O2 saturation 98% without oxygen therapy. Blood pressure 142/83. Heart rate 55 bpm. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, at a good frequency. No audible murmurs at baseline or after Valsalva manoeuvre. Bladder murmur preserved, without pathological noises added. Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Distal pulses preserved and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Cardiac MRI (February/2016): left ventricle (LV) not dilated, with preserved global and segmental mobility. EF measured with the Simpson method of 72%. Maximum basal septal thickness of 12 mm, with the rest of the segments with preserved thicknesses. The myocardial mass is 107 g, indexed at 61.43 g/m . The right ventricle is normal. No abnormalities were observed in the late enhancement sequence.  Electrocardiogram (June/2019): sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, 30o axis, PR 224 ms, Narrow QRS with criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy by Sokolow criteria, biphasic T in V1-V2, negative in I, II, III, aVF and deep and asymmetric negative in V3-V6, with ST rectification in these leads, QTc 428 ms. Echocardiogram (June/2019): non-dilated left ventricle with mild concentric hypertrophy of its walls (IVS 13.5 mm, LIP 11.5 mm), a greater myocardial thickness is seen at the apical level, about 15-16 mm, with systolic closure in "ace of spades" morphology with slight hypokinesia of the most apical segments, so it could not be ruled out that it is an apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with little myocardial involvement.  Biauricular dilatation. Mitral with mild insufficiency, without SAM. Mild aortic insufficiency due to slight dilatation of the aortic root. Rest of valves without alterations. Preserved LV systolic function with LVEF 65-70%. LV diastolic and RV systolic function unaltered.  Cardiac MRI (June/2019): non-dilated left ventricle with hypertrophy only at the apical level, mainly of the lower apical segments and the true apex with thicknesses between 12-13 mm and maximum thickness in the lower apical segment reaching 15 mm. In cine sequences in the vertical long axis plane, the left ventricle shows the typical "ace of spades" morphology. The EF measured with the Simpson method is 60%. Myocardial mass 93 g, indexed by body surface area of 54 g/m. Right ventricle without alterations. In the first-pass perfusion sequence, no basal perfusion defects. Late enhancement/viability sequence shows no fibrosis or necrosis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient underwent a new outpatient cardiac MRI at our centre, with the finding of a non-dilated left ventricle with hypertrophy only at the apical level, mainly of the lower apical segments and the true apex with thicknesses of between 12-13 mm, with the lower apical segment reaching 15 mm and the left ventricle presenting the typical "ace of spades" morphology in cine 2C. The EF measured with the Simpson method is 60%. The late enhancement/viability sequence showed no fibrosis or necrosis. The patient subsequently visited the clinic to collect the results and reported to be completely asymptomatic. The nature of the disease and its hereditary nature were explained to the patient, and it was decided, given the low diagnostic yield of the genetic study in the apical variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and that the patient had no children and only one sibling, to continue the family study by echocardiography and/or cardiac MRI if this was inconclusive. Subsequent follow-up in the arrhythmia unit with 24-hour Holter monitoring is indicated.  DIAGNOSIS Non-obstructive apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. No fibrosis by cardiac MRI. HCM-SCD Score 0.99%. Paroxysmal counterclockwise atrial flutter. Effective CTI ablation without the use of scopy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 60-year-old man attended the emergency department of our centre due to chest pain.  History The patient had the following medical history: Cardiovascular risk factors: type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent, on treatment with two drugs, with good metabolic control (HbA1c 6.8%); well-controlled arterial hypertension (home blood pressure (BP) < 140/80 mmHg) with two drugs. No previous cardiological history. Other relevant medical history: peripheral vascular disease, with stenosis in the right superficial femoral artery and absence of right pedal pulse, treated with drug-eluting balloon angioplasty with good results.  Usual treatment: Sitagliptin + metformin 50/1000 mg, 1 tablet every 12 hours. Valsartan + amlodipine 40/10 mg, 1 tablet per day. Omeprazole 20 mg, 1 capsule per day. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg, 1 tablet per day.  Present illness On arrival at the emergency department, the patient presented with oppressive central thoracic pain radiating to the neck and both arms, lasting 2 hours from onset at rest, associated with cold sweating. No previous similar episodes. No symptoms suggestive of exertional angina with usual physical activity.  Physical examination BP 105/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 100 bpm, oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Jugular venous pressure normal. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs or pathological sounds. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur with no extra sounds. Abdomen: soft and depressible, not painful on palpation, no masses or megaliths, Blumberg and Murphy negative. Extremities: no oedema in the lower extremities, peripheral pulses preserved and symmetrical, no signs of phlebitis An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed in less than 10 minutes, which showed the presence of subepicardial lesion current in the inferior face, so a haemodynamic alert was activated.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on arrival at the emergency department: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm. Normal PR. QRS 90 ms. qS in V1. ST-segment elevation up to 3 mm in DII, DIII and aVF with specular decrease in DI and aVL. Portable chest X-ray: slightly increased cardiothoracic index in this anteroposterior projection. No pleural effusion, no signs of vascular redistribution. No condensation. Emergent coronary angiography: right dominance. Left main coronary artery (LMCA) without lesions. Anterior descending artery (AD) with severe lesion of 90% in the middle segment. Circumflex with 40% lesion in distal segment. Right coronary artery (RCA) with 90% long lesion that starts in the proximal segment and extends to the middle segment. Good distal bed. It was decided to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the DC lesion. After predilating with a 2.5 x 20 mm semi-compliant balloon, a 2.75 x 30 mm sirolimus-eluting drug-eluting stent was implanted with a good final angiographic result. Echocardiogram in the coronary unit: mild left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, with preserved diameters and slightly depressed LVEF (Simpson BP 50%) secondary to inferolateral and inferior mediobasal hypokinesia. Absence of significant valvular heart disease. Normal transmitral filling, estimated normal LV end-diastolic pressure (E/E' = 7). RV with normal diameters and preserved function. Absence of tricuspid insufficiency (TI) allowing estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PSAP). Normal inferior vena cava (IVC). Absence of pericardial effusion.  Ordinary laboratory tests: Blood count: haemoglobin 13.9 g/dl, without leukocytosis or left shift. Platelets 241 x 10^9/l. Haemostasis: INR 0.99, TTPa 29.3 sec. Biochemistry: fasting glucose 118 mg/dl, sodium 139 mEq/l, potassium 4 mEq/l, creatinine 0.49 mg/dl (GFR > 90 ml/min/1.72 m2), NT-proBNP 266 pg/ml, C-reactive protein 0.7 mg/dl, HbA1c 6.8%, total cholesterol 176 mg/dl, triglycerides 102 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 37 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 119 mg/dl. Myocardial damage biomarker curve (hsTnI, normal < 19.8 ng/l): 53 - 24,900 (above detection limit) - 15,000 - 4,408 - 2,977 ng/l. ECG at discharge (image 3): sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Normal PR. QRS 90 ms with axis at 60o. Negative T wave in DII, DIII and aVF. Elective coronary angiography (video 4): good result of stent implanted in CD. PCI on LAD: lesion is predilated with SC balloon 2.5 x 20 mm and NC 3 x 20 mm, implanting a 3 x 26 mm zotarolimus-eluting drug-eluting stent, with a good final angiographic result.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After finding ST-segment elevation in the inferior face in a patient with anginal chest pain, a loading dose of prasugrel was administered (the patient was already receiving chronic treatment with ASA 100 mg) and the infarction code was activated. Emergent coronary angiography showed three-vessel disease, with two severe lesions (in the MD and DCM) and a moderate lesion in the distal circumflex (DC). A decision was made to perform constant pharmacoactive PCI on the middle DC, the artery responsible for the infarction (ARI), which was performed without incident. After angioplasty, he was admitted to the coronary unit, where beta-blocker and lipid-lowering treatment was started, and he remained asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable. After 48 hours without arrhythmic events, it was decided to discharge him to the cardiology ward and, after mobilisation without incident, to his home. Medical treatment at discharge was: Acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, 1 tablet per day. Prasugrel 10 mg, 1 tablet per day. Rosuvastatin 20 mg, 1 tablet at night. Dapagliflozin + metformin 5/1000 mg, 1 tablet every 12 hours. Nebivolol 2.5 mg, 1 tablet per day. Omeprazole 20 mg, 1 capsule per day. Valsartan + amlodipine 40/10 mg, 1 tablet per day. After discharge, the patient was scheduled 3 weeks later for elective outpatient angioplasty on the severe lesion of the middle anterior descending artery, which was performed without complications. After this second procedure, the patient was included in the cardiovascular rehabilitation programme of our centre.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation of inferior location. Killip I. Three-vessel coronary artery disease: Mid CD (ARI) 90%, mid DA 90%, distal Cx 40%. Primary PCI with drug-eluting stentliberator over mid-CD. Second outpatient elective PCI on severe mid LAD lesion. Mild left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 50%). Peripheral arterial disease. Type 2 diabetes mellitus with good metabolic control. LDL cholesterol above target (< 50 mg/dl). Arterial hypertension. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 57-year-old male with a personal history of arterial hypertension (AHT), no other known cardiovascular risk factors and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) with no invasive treatment to date. On treatment only with atenolol 100 mg per day. On waking up on the morning of admission at 8:00 a.m., he felt dizzy and unstable and fell to the floor. He was rushed to the emergency department for assessment. Haemodynamic stability was observed, with elevated blood pressure 190/117 mmHg, heart rate 59 bpm, afebrile state and baseline oxygen saturation of 92%. The neurological examination showed a NIHSS 7: dysarthric speech, left central facial paresis, striking horizontal-rotatory nystagmus with rapid leftward movement, claudication of the lower limbs and mild hypoaesthesia of algesic predominance in the right hemibody including the face. The rest of the physical examination showed cardiac auscultation without murmurs or extratonos and respiratory auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur without added noises. An electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm was requested, and blood tests showed platelets and normal coagulation, with only an elevated D-dimer. An emergency multimodal computed tomography (CT) scan (without perfusion) was performed, showing occlusion of the left vertebral artery along segment V3-4, compatible with acute thrombus, as well as chronic ischaemic lesions in the basal ganglia, left thalamus and cerebellar hemispheres.  Given the acute nature of the picture, the clear neurological deficit, the evidence of thrombus, a good baseline situation assessed on the Ratkin Scale and the absence of contraindications for the same, a pharmacoinvasive strategy was decided, so r-TPA was administered and the patient was transferred to the referral hospital for clinical monitoring in the Stroke Unit due to the possibility of progression to the basilar artery and the need for surgical treatment.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 78 bpm, short PR with initial QRS flattening compatible with a delta wave, repolarisation disturbance consisting of non-significant ST segment underleveling in left precordial leads and lateral face with negative T wave, probably secondary to WPW. ED CBC: leukocytes 8,500/μl, segmented 45.4% (3,800/μ)l, lymphocytes 40.3% (3,400/μl), red blood cells 5.790 million/μl, haemoglobin 15.1 g/dl, haematocrit 47.5%, MCV 82 fl, platelets 163 thousands/μl, prothrombin time 11.4 seconds, prothrombin activity 94%, aTTP 28.2 seconds, fibrinogen 484 mg/dl, urgent D-dimer 2,099 ng/ml, INR 1.04, serum glucose 109 mg/dl, urea 26 mg/dl, creatinine 0.88 mg/dl. Urgent cranial CT and perfusion CT: subcortical hypodensity of about 5 mm in the right cerebellar hemisphere suggestive of chronic ischaemic lesion. Hypodensities in the anterior arm of the internal capsule, in the lenticular nucleus and in the thalamic region of the left hemisphere, with attenuation similar to CSF, suggestive of chronic lacunar infarcts. Fourth ventricle of normal size and morphology, centred in the midline. Basal cisterns free and symmetrical. No densitometric alterations were observed in the brainstem. No intra- or extra-axial bleeding or midline deviation. Hyperdensity of the V4 segment of the left vertebral artery in probable relation to acute thrombus. The perfusion study is not valid in the study performed to assess the vertebrobasilar axis. Retention cysts in maxillary and left sphenoidal sinuses. Angio-CT of TSA and urgent cerebral arteries: carotid axes of normal morphology and paths up to the bifurcation, with non-obstructive flat calcified atheroma plaque at the origin of the left internal carotid artery. Both internal carotid arteries are patent and of normal calibre. Right vertebral artery patent up to the basilar trunk. Repletion defect along V3 and V4 of the left vertebral artery, compatible with acute thrombus. No associated collaterals were seen in this segment. Intracranially, the vascular structures of the polygon of Willis are permeable and of normal calibre with no repletion defects or aneurysms. Conclusion: findings compatible with acute thrombus in V3 and V4 of the left vertebral artery. Chronic ischaemic lesions in the left basal ganglia and thalamus and in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Routine laboratory tests on the neurology ward: glucose 111 mg/dl. Urea 20 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.69 mg/dl. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) > 90 ml/min/1.73 m . Uric acid 3.2 mg/dl. Sodium 140.4 mEq/l. Potassium 3,71 mEq/l. Chlorine 104,4 mEq/l. Calcium 9 mg/dl. Phosphorus 2,6 mg/dl. Total proteins 6,85 g/dl. Albumin 4.1 g/dl. Cholesterol 205 mg/dl. HDL cholesterol 55 mg/dl. Calculated LDL cholesterol 117 mg/dl. Triglycerides 166 mg/dl. GOT(AST) 17 U/l. GPT(ALT) 16 U/l. GGT 21 U/l. Total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl. Alkaline phosphatase 38 U/l. Glycosylated haemoglobin 5.7%. Thrombophilia study: normal results. Antithrombin III 84%, protein C 145%, resistance to activated protein C 3.1, antigenic free protein S 108%, prothrombin factor 20210 A gene negative, momocysteine 8 MicroMol/l. Chest CT with VSD (PET protocol): multiple entral repletion defects are observed at the level of: lobar artery for LID with extension to segmental and subsegmental branches, segmental arteries for LM, LSD and LII, some with extension to subsegmental branches. Findings in relation to bilateral acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Increased calibre of the pulmonary artery trunk (35 mm) and its main branches (APD of 25 mm, API of 25 mm), in relation to PTE. No signs suggestive of right heart cavity overload. No pericardial effusion is observed. No significant supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Accessory fissure of the azygos as an anatomical variant of normality. Laminar bibasal atelectasis. Small calcified granuloma in LSD. Rest of the lung parenchyma without pathological findings. No pleural effusion. Mild dorsal spondyloarthrosis. Hiatal hernia. Diagnostic impression: findings compatible with bilateral acute PTE and PHT. Post-fibrinolysis control CT scan: evolving ischaemic lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere in the territory of the PICA. No signs suggesting haemorrhagic transformation. Echo Doppler of the lower extremities: no evidence of DVT. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed in the stroke unit: non-dilated left ventricle, mild septal hypertrophy with preserved systolic function (LVEF 60%) without alterations in segmental contractility. Right ventricle not dilated, normofunctioning (TAPSE 24 mm, S wave 0.21m/s). Diastolic flattening of the IVS suggestive of volume overload in the right chambers; no other signs suggestive of right chamber involvement. Degenerative aortic valve disease resulting in mild aortic insufficiency (VC 3 mm). Mitral filling pattern not assessable by wave fusion. Mild tricuspid insufficiency allowing estimation of PSAP 33 mmHg. Absence of pericardial effusion. IVC at the upper limit of normality with respirophasic variations in its calibre. Aneurysm of the interatrial septum with redundant movement, without intracavitary claroshunt. It is recommended to complete the study with bubble echocardiogram to rule out shunt from right to left cavities. Transthoracic echocardiogram with bubbles: very positive bubble test, with passage of abundant bubbles (> 30) in first beats without Valsalva. Transesophageal echocardiogram: a study was performed to assess the interatrial septum due to stroke, PTE and positive bubble test. The presence of PFO of the tunneled type with significant passage of bubbles to the left cavities at baseline was confirmed. The edges of the septum secundum are thick, 18 mm long inferiorly and 26 mm posteriorly, the distance between the two edges being about 25 mm. Left atrial appendage without thrombus and with normal flow. Conclusions: patent foramen ovale tunnel type. Electrophysiological study: baseline findings: HV 0 ms. Concentric and decremental retrograde conduction (therefore absence of retrograde conduction through the pathway) 1:1 up to 400 ms. Preexcitation with 1:1 accessory pathway conduction only up to 560 ms. Anterograde PW 450 ms, PRENAV 600/350 ms. An area with AV continuity and ventriculogram with precocity with respect to the onset of delta is identified. Anterograde conduction via the accessory pathway is transiently interrupted very easily in relation to the manipulation of the catheter in the area. A 35 W RF application is performed, with interruption of the pre-excitation at the start of the application. A total of 7 applications are performed, with a total RF time of 154 ms. After the waiting period, the absence of bidirectional conduction in the pathway was verified. Complete atrial and ventricular pacing protocols were repeated after the ablation, confirming 1:1 concentric and decremental VA conduction up to 380 ms, a PW of 133 bpm, with an anterograde nodal curve without AH jump and without inducing echoes or tachycardia. After the wait, two additional safety applications were performed with the same parameters (duration 58 s). A subcutaneous Holter was implanted in the left parasternal position.  Post-ablation ECG: sinus rhythm at 68 bpm. No signs of pre-excitation. No alteration in repolarisation or intraventricular conduction. Percutaneous closure of PFO: a 30 mm cribriform closure device was implanted. By means of the depush and pull manoeuvre and angiography, its correct position is verified.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his stay in the stroke unit, haemodynamic support, cardiorespiratory monitoring and strict control of cardiovascular risk factors were carried out. On arrival on the ward, a blood test was drawn with a coagulation study that included a D-dimer determination, as the first determination carried out in the emergency department was elevated, the new result being even higher. For this reason, together with the presence of slight dyspnoea, it was decided to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). After an angio-CT scan of the pulmonary arteries revealed the existence of acute bilateral PTE, a control cranial CT scan was performed to rule out haemorrhagic transformation after fibrinolysis. Therefore, after a risk-benefit assessment, it was decided to start anticoagulation with IV sodium heparin, with subsequent transition to LMWH. A Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs was performed, which ruled out the existence of deep vein thrombosis, and a transthoracic echocardiogram ruled out right ventricular dysfunction but revealed the existence of an aneurysm of the interatrial septum, which was studied by means of a bubble echocardiogram and a transesophageal echocardiogram, revealing the existence of a PFO, unknown until then. The most likely cause of the stroke + PTE was considered to be paradoxical embolism due to PFO in a patient with WPW and possible associated arrhythmia (the most plausible being atrial fibrillation associated with WPW). It was then decided to study and ablate the accessory pathway, implanting a subcutaneous Holter at the same time to study subsequent arrhythmias, whether unrelated to WPW syndrome or due to recurrence. The evolution from the neurological point of view was very favourable, with practically complete resolution of the clinical manifestations, although instability persisted, so it was decided to discharge the patient. In a second stage, after one month, percutaneous closure of the tunneled PFO is performed, given that it has anatomical risk criteria. After this last intervention, the patient is recommended hygienic-dietary measures, gradually introducing light physical activity, as well as a varied diet, without excess salt, and with sugar control given his pre-diabetes stage. Endocarditis prophylaxis for the next 6 months, if invasive dental procedures are performed. Regarding medication: rivaroxaban 20 mg/24 hours, clopidogrel 75 mg/24 hours for 6 months, candersartan/hydrochlorothiazide 16/12.5 mg/24 hours, atorvastatin 80 mg/24 hours. Regarding the maintenance of anticoagulation, a new control angio-CT scan could be considered to rule out thrombotic remnants of the PTE and in that case its withdrawal could be considered, also subject to the possible detection of atrial fibrillation with the subcutaneous Holter.  DIAGNOSIS Acute ischaemic stroke in vertebrobasilar territory, acute occlusion segment V3-4 of the left vertebral artery with involvement of the ipsilateral posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and bilateral acute pulmonary thromboembolism on admission with fibrinolysis. Permeable tunnelled foramen ovale closed percutaneously. WPW accessory pathway ablation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION History 80-year-old male. No known drug allergies. Ex-smoker for 20 years (AE 15 packs/year). Cardiovascular risk factors include arterial hypertension (AHT) on treatment with candesartan 32 mg per day and type 2 diabetes mellitus on treatment with empagliflozin/metformin 5/1,000 mg per day. No known cardiological history. History only includes benign prostatic hyperplasia and cataract surgery in both eyes. Independent for all basic activities of daily living, including advanced activities (Rankin 0).  Present illness The patient was brought to the emergency department of our centre by basic life support after being found by his sister on the floor of her home at 15:00 hours with clinical symptoms consisting of deviation of the right corner of the mouth, ocular deviation to the left and speech impairment. He had a scalp injury suggestive of cranioencephalic trauma. The last time he was seen asymptomatic was the previous day at around 11:00 am.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 187/98 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 98 bpm, basal oxygen saturation 94%. Mixed aphasia: language not very fluent, although communication is possible. Understands some simple commands. Altered naming. Left visual preference. Right homonymous hemianopsia on confrontational campimetry. Left supranuclear facial paresis. Rest of cranial nerves preserved. Claudication of the right lower limb (NIHSS of 8 points). Cardiac auscultation: regular sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, without pathological sounds. Abdomen was normal. Normal and symmetrical pulses.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 95 bpm. PR 140 ms. Narrow QRS with normal axis. Embryonic R in precordials up to V4 with negative T in I, aVL, V5-V6. CBC: glucose 138 mg/dl. Urea 39 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.91 mg/dl. Sodium 141 mmol/l. Potassium 4.4 mmol/l. CPK 98 U/l. CRP 7.0 mg/l. Hb 15.7 g/dl. MCV 92 fl. Leukocytes 4,6x10^9/l. Platelets 165 x10^9/l. INR 1.07. Troponin T ultrasensitive 76 pg/ml -> 68.3 at 6 hours (normal < 14). Chest X-ray: no consolidation or pleural effusion. Vacuum cranial computed tomography (CT): discrete cerebral corticosubcortical atrophy. Left occipital and left thalamus hypodensities of acute ischaemic origin of new onset, not present in previous CT (2015). Hypodensity in left insula of probable chronic ischaemic origin already present in previous CT scan. Angio-CT of supra-aortic trunks and Willis polygon after administration of intravenous contrast (image 2): repletion defect in P2A segment of left posterior cerebral artery. The rest of the arteries of the polygon of Willis are patent, with no aneurysmal dilatations or significant stenosis or images suggestive of thrombosis/occlusion. Perfusion CT scan after administration of IVC: penumbra area in the left posterior cerebral artery territory, with mismatch greater than 20%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with angio-MRI: extensive acute ischaemic infarction in the left temporo-occipital and left thalamic territory (the latter with haemorrhagic transformation). Angiographic sequences identify supra-aortic trunks with no evidence of significant stenosis. The arterial structures of the polygon of Willis show a normal carotid system and basilar system with no evidence of vascular malformations or significant stenosis. Transthoracic echocardiography: cardiac cavities of normal size, with moderate hypertrophy, predominantly septal. Slightly depressed LVEF (48% by Simpson) at the expense of akinesia of the septum and anterior wall in its apical segments and strict apex akinesia. Normal TAPSE. No significant valvulopathy. There was a mass attached to the septoapical wall, protruding and mobile, measuring 20x17 mm, compatible with left intraventricular thrombus. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Late enhancement sequence: rounded thrombus of 11x16x15 mm adhered to septoapical wall. Lateral hypokinesia, apical segments and strict apex. Absence of myocardial oedema. Non-transmural subendocardial necrosis on the lateral aspect. Absence of necrosis in the apical segments. Transthoracic echocardiography two months after discharge: resolution of the thrombus observed in the previous echography with persistence of the contractility alterations described in previous echocardiographies.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was 80 years of age, with a good functional level, who presented with clinical symptoms compatible with ischaemic stroke in the left posterior cerebral artery territory with NISS > 6. The emergency department activated the stroke code, observing P2 segment occlusion in the CT angiography. Fibrinolytic treatment was ruled out due to the uncertain evolution time and interventional radiology was contacted for evaluation of endovascular treatment, which was also ruled out due to hypodensity established in the vacuum CT scan and occlusion distal to P1. Subsequently, ischaemia was observed in different arterial territories in cerebral MRI. Angiography showed a normal carotid and basilar system with no evidence of vascular malformations or significant stenosis. As part of the aetiological study of the stroke, a regular transthoracic echocardiography was requested, showing intraventricular thrombus adhered to the septoapical wall. The cardiology department was consulted and the study was completed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which also showed lateral hypokinesia of the apical segments and strict apex and non-transmural subendocardial necrosis on the lateral aspect compatible with old infarction. In the directed anamnesis, the patient had no previous symptoms of chest pain, dyspnoea or other cardiological symptoms. Given the characteristics of the patient; elderly and with a recent stroke with haemorrhagic transformation in some of the affected brain territories, anticoagulation with rivaroxaban 20 mg per day was agreed with the neurology department. Given that the patient had not previously experienced chest pain, LVEF was not severely compromised and given the acute situation of stroke with haemorrhagic transformation, it was decided not to perform coronary catheterisation for the time being and to assess after resolution of the apical thrombus. On discharge, the patient's language was not very fluent, but he understood orders, named correctly and repeated. Persistence of campimetric deficit consisting of right homonymous hemianopsia. No motor deficit (NIHSS of 3 points). The control echocardiography at one month on an outpatient basis showed a decrease in the size of the thrombus and in the control echocardiography at two months, resolution of the thrombus with persistence of the contractility alterations described in previous echocardiographies.  DIAGNOSIS Ischaemic stroke in the left posterior cerebral artery territory of embolic aetiology. Intraventricular thrombus. Old myocardial infarction in lateral face and apical segments. Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Arterial hypertension. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

During the previous two months she had presented episodes of chest pain with moderate exertion (climbing stairs), which resolved with rest or taking nitroglycerine, which is why ranolazine had been associated with her last visit. She denied other symptoms, such as dyspnoea, oedema of the lower limbs, palpitations or infectious symptoms.  Physical examination Vital signs: blood pressure 182/132 mmHg. Heart rate 69 bpm. Oxygen saturation 98% basal. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented, cooperative, normohydrated and normoperfused. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no extra sounds. Abdomen: hydro-aerial sounds preserved, soft and depressible, not painful on palpation. Lower limbs: no oedema, distal pulses preserved.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests on admission: glucose 83 mg/dl, creatinine 1.46 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate 47.30 ml/min, sodium 139 mmol/l, potassium 3.9 mmol/l, chlorine 106 mmol/l, C-reactive protein 2.6 mg/l (0 - 5), two troponin I determinations 0.0 ng/ml, natriuretic peptide (BNP) 83.8 pg/ml. Analysis of cardiovascular risk factors: HbA1c 7.6%, LDL 73 mg/dl, triglycerides 110 mg/dl. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with chest pain: sinus rhythm at 78 bpm. ST-segment elevation downward sloping by 1 mm, especially in precordial leads, I and aVL. Pain-free ECG (image 2): sinus rhythm at 72 bpm. Correction of dynamic repolarisation changes. Coronary angiography: LMCA with a mild calcified plaque in the distal segment of 30%. Calcified LAD with total occlusion in the middle segment, with retrograde distal collateral filling. Cx of good calibre and development with a stent in the middle segment permeable and without restenosis, and another stent in the first marginal branch permeable and without restenosis. Distally in the obtuse marginal branch he has a significant lesion of 70%, evaluated with pressure guide and intracoronary adenosine with a result of 0.77 (significant). Dominant DC of good calibre and development with a moderate plaque in the proximal segment of 60% evaluated with pressure guide and intracoronary adenosine with FFR = 0.87 (not significant), distally with diffuse irregularities and an under-occlusion of the PL branch of chronic aspect. Echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle with preserved ejection fraction, without gross alterations of segmental contractility. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricle of normal size and function. No significant valvulopathies.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to cardiology and, given the progression of his symptoms over the last few months despite the adjustment of anti-anginal medication, it was decided to perform coronary angiography, where a significant lesion was found in the first MVO (assessed by pressure guidewire), which was revascularised with a drug-eluting stent. During hospitalisation, the patient had no new episodes of chest pain and was discharged early. Despite being a patient widely known to cardiology, cardiovascular risk factors are not controlled, so special emphasis is placed on this aspect. It seems particularly important to optimise glycaemic control and, given that the patient is obese, it is decided to associate a GLP1 agonist (semaglutide 0.25 mg once a week), with a target HbA1c of less than 7%. In addition, ezetimibe was added to his treatment, with a target LDL of less than 55 mg/dl. At the follow-up consultation after completion of the cardiac rehabilitation programme, the patient had achieved weight loss of 8 kg, smoking cessation and better laboratory control (HbA1c 6.8%, LDL 54 mg/dl).  DIAGNOSIS NSTEACS type unstable angina. Significant lesion of 70% in the first OM assessed by pressure guidewire (FFR 0.77) revascularised percutaneously by means of a pharmacoactive destenting implant. Chronic total occlusion of the middle anterior descending artery. Complex chronic ischaemic heart disease, revascularised in a mixed form on multiple occasions. Type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor glycaemic control. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History The patient is an 18-year-old male, with no known drug allergies or toxic habits. He had presented in childhood with some episodes of bronchospasm related to mite and pollen allergy that improved with beta-2 mimetic inhalers, but he had been crisis-free since the age of 14 years, and he regularly played sports with good tolerance. He first consulted the emergency department of our hospital in 2004 for self-limited abdominal pain, and the following findings were noted in the complementary tests performed: The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 55 bpm, with a right QRS axis and morphology of complete right bundle branch block (RBBB), criteria for right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and repolarisation abnormalities in V1-V4. Laboratory tests showed discrete polyglobulia (17.3 gn/dl). The chest X-ray showed prominence of the pulmonary arteries and the arch of the azygos. In view of these findings, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which revealed indirect evidence of severe pulmonary hypertension, with moderate hypertrophy and mild dilatation of the right ventricle (RV), as well as a hitherto unknown patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Subsequently, a right heart catheterisation confirmed the presence of severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT) (high mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and normal pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP). In May 2004, the patient underwent surgery at a private centre, with section and closure of both ductal stumps by left thoracotomy. He had the following complications from the procedure: a resolved left recurrent nerve palsy and a left pneumothorax. In the following years, fibrosing mediastinitis was also discovered, requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. In September 2005, a post-surgery right heart catheterisation was performed, which revealed persistent severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (PAPm 73 mmHg, PCP 7 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 13.75 UW, cardiac output (CO) 4.8 l/min). In addition, there was evidence of reopening of the PDA with residual flow. In view of these findings, the patient began follow-up in the monographic pulmonary hypertension clinic at our hospital. He had normal respiratory function tests, NT-proBNP 22 ng/ml and persistent polyglobulia (20 g/dl), no nocturnal desaturation in pulse oximetry and in the 6-minute walk test he covered 705 m with maintained constants. In 2008 he was referred to a pulmonary hypertension unit of a reference hospital for pulmonary hypertension. At that time the patient was in functional class I, without cyanosis or signs of right heart failure (HF). Discrete polyglobulia persists, and on TTE the PAWD is seen with a right-to-left flow and a hypertrophic RV with moderate dysfunction. Ergospirometry shows functional class I with moderately reduced functional capacity and normal blood pressure (BP). Given the patient's good functional class, re-evaluation in 9 months is recommended before starting specific treatment for PAH. Finally, given the persistence of severe PAH in a new catheterisation (PAPm 90 mmHg, PCP 10 mmHg, PVR 14 UW, GC 5.6 l/min), it was decided to start specific treatment for PAH, initially with sitaxentan, which was suspended due to its withdrawal from the market and replaced by ambrisentan 5 mg/24 hours, later adding tadalafil 40 mg/24 hours. In November 2018, he was referred for the first time to the adult congenital heart disease clinic at our hospital. At that time he was clinically stable with NYHA I-II/IV dyspnoea. NT-proBNP 279 pg/ml. TTE unchanged with respect to previous ones. On treatment with ambrisentan 10 mg/24 hours + tadalafil 40 mg/24 hours + symbicort 160/4.5 mcg 1 inhalations/12 hours. Subsequent check-ups did not show much functional change, changes in TTE or treatment. In April 2019, a cardiac MRI was performed, showing progression of RV dysfunction with RV ejection fraction (RVEF) of 37% (RVEF in May 2018 was 57%). However, it seems that the patient is reluctant to have a follow-up right heart catheterisation, even though it is suggested to him to consider adding a third drug to the treatment of his PAH.  Current disease In June 2019, the patient was admitted for an episode of frank haemoptysis (50 cc) and a gurgling sensation in the left hemithorax that required admission to the coronary unit of our hospital for close monitoring. He had previously presented another episode of haemoptysis in April of the same year, which required admission to the respiratory department and had been managed conservatively.  Physical examination On admission to the coronary unit, the patient was haemodynamically stable (blood pressure (BP) 110/58 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 98 bpm), oxygen saturation (O2) 96% with inspired O2 fraction (FiO2) 21% and no signs of right HF.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 50 bpm, normal PR, right axis, QRS with BCRDHH morphology with criteria of HVD and secondary repolarisation alterations in precordial leads. CBC: glucose 93 mg/dl, urea 32 mg/dl, creatinine 1.09 mg/dl, GPT 14 U/L, bilirubin 0.9 mg/dl, calcium 9.6 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium null, chlorine 105 mEq/l, albumin 4.4 g/dl, C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.60 mg/l, creatine kinase (CK) 104 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) null. Haemoglobin 20.9 g/dl, haematocrit 59.5%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 85.5 fL, mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) 30 pg, erythrocyte distribution amplitude (EDA) 14.8%, platelets 172000, 5170 leukocytes (35.40% lymphocytes, 52.60% neutrophils, 7.70% monocytes). Prothrombin time 66%, international normalised ratio (INR) 1.3, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 42s, fibrinogen 313 mg/dl. Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index 0.5, with prominence of the pulmonary arteries. TTE: left ventricle (LV) neither dilated nor hypertrophic with preserved global function, very marked septal flattening due to overload of right pressures, with a diastolic eccentricity index of 1.5. The mitral valve is normofunctioning and the aortic valve is bicuspid due to complete fusion of the right and left coronary sinuses, with minimal aortic insufficiency. The RV is moderately dilated and severely hypertrophic, with moderately depressed function. The tricuspid valve is thickened with poorly visualised right ventricle-right atrium (RV-RA) gradient, but at least 100 mmHg. The inferior vena cava is not dilated, with inspiratory collapse greater than 50%. Mild flow acceleration of up to 26 mmHg without diastolic tail is seen in the arch. Dilated pulmonary artery trunk (40 mm). The ductus is wide, with right-to-left systolic flow.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient remained monitored and under conservative treatment with oral codeine and morphine chloride for 24 hours in the coronary unit, haemodynamically stable at all times and with no new episodes of haemoptysis. The patient was transferred to the reference hospital for pulmonary hypertension to assess the possibility of starting a third line of treatment for PAH. At this hospital, a new right catheterisation was performed prior to starting intravenous prostacyclin (PAPm 87 mmHg, PCP 6 mmHg, PVR 17.34 UW, GC by thermodilution 4.67 l/min). Initially, epoprostenol was prescribed, but it required several changes of venous line due to phlebitis, so finally, titration with subcutaneous treprostinil was started with good tolerance, reaching a dose of 24 ng/kg/min at discharge. After implantation of the subcutaneous pump, treprostinil can be progressively increased. Since the start of the drug, the patient reports clinical improvement, no alarm symptoms and no new episodes of haemoptysis. In addition, the control echocardiogram performed showed an improvement in RV function, which was currently at the lower limit of normality.  DIAGNOSIS Severe residual pulmonary arterial hypertension after surgery. Intervened patent ductus arteriosus. Right ventricular function at the lower limit of normal. Fibrosing mediastinitis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 32-year-old male with no known drug allergies, moderate drinker with no other cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF), no personal medical or surgical history of interest and not under chronic medical treatment. His family history includes three maternal uncles who died of sudden death at a young age (specify the years, if you have them), the aetiology of which is unknown. Father and mother without heart disease or sudden death events. They lead an active life appropriate to their age.  Current illness The patient reports recurrent and intermittent symptoms characterised by palpitations, since adolescence. The symptoms have worsened in recent months with syncopal episodes with loss of postural position and level of consciousness, for which he consulted as an outpatient.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 120/80 mmHG, heart rate (HR) 70 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) 20 rpm, oxygen saturation (O2 Sat) 95%. Normal colour and normohydrated. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, non-painful, no masses or megaliths. Lower extremities: no oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory: haemogram: leucocytes 7x10*9/l, Hb 13 g/dl, platelets 310x10*9/l. Biochemistry: glucose 181 mg/dl [70-110], urea 59 mg/dl [10-50], creatinine 1.53 mg/dl [.40-1.20] total bilirubin 1.47 mg/dl [0-1.2], GPT 154 U/L [5-41]. Electrocardiogram (ECG): regular sinus rhythm with a frequency of 70 bpm, rSr ́ in V1 and V2, with ST segment elevation of 5 mm and inverted T in these leads, Brugada type I pattern. Colour Doppler echocardiogram: DDVI/DSVI 50/30, SIVD/PPD 11/11, EF 68%, RV 20, free wall thickness 10 mm. Left atrium area 23 cm2 without ventricular motility disorders, no alterations in transvalvular flow, PSAP 20. 24-hour Holter ECG: detection of monomorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) tracing of short duration up to 200 bpm that correlates with the patient's symptoms. Chest X-ray after ICD implantation: cardiothoracic index less than 0.5 with presence of generator in left hemithorax and lead to RV. ICD telemetry at follow-up (1 or 6 months): evidence in evolutionary controls of appropriate ICD discharges in the event of arrhythmic events in the form of rapid ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Patient with clinical syncopal episodes and cardiovascular history of sudden death in relatives (without genetic study), with morphological studies with echocardiogram without pathological findings. Taking into account her baseline ECG with Brugada type I pattern, her family history, repeated syncopal clinical events and evidence of symptomatic arrhythmic events (NSVT) on 24-hour Holter, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was established and implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was decided as primary prevention in a patient with Brugada syndrome at very high risk of sudden death. The implantation was uneventful and the patient reported being in GF I in subsequent check-ups (6 months post-implantation), and had had a few very isolated syncopal episodes. On review of the device (ICD), VT episodes were observed in VT2 (180 bpm) and VF (200 bpm) with antitachycardia ventricular pacing therapy (ATP) and appropriate ICD shocks.  DIAGNOSIS Brugada syndrome. Implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). No structural heart disease (normal LVEF). GF I. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 53-year-old woman with no known allergic reactions to medications.  History Family history: sudden death during sleep of maternal grandfather at 70 years of age and of a maternal uncle at 50 years of age, also during sleep. Daughter with long QT on baseline ECG and son with incipient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype.  Personal history: No toxic habits, no arterial hypertension (AHT), no diabetes, no dyslipidaemia. Non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: accidental diagnosis in another centre after starting a study due to palpitations. Phenotype with asymmetric septal hypertrophy, with a maximum thickness of 18 mm in the basal anterior septum, maximum gradient of 15 mmHg, LVEF 65% and faint mesocardial fibrosis in areas of hypertrophy and at the lower insertion point of the RV in cardiac MRI. Holter: sinus rhythm with an average heart rate of 60 bpm, anecdotal supraventricular extrasystoles with a SVT salvo of 4 beats, anecdotal ventricular extrasystoles with a nocturnal triplet at 90 bpm, with no other events. Ergometry with 8.8 METS, clinically negative, electrocardiographically positive from minute 5 (upward sloping ST-segment depression in II, III, aVF, V5 and V6 of up to 1.5 mm, which persists at minute 2 of recovery, subsiding spontaneously), with a drop in blood pressure at maximum effort, although asymptomatic. Overlap with long QT syndrome (LQTS). Genetic study: no pathogenic/probably pathogenic variant related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is identified. A probably pathogenic variant in KCNQ1 compatible with LQTS type 1 is identified, also confirmed in his daughter. Other: fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain. Surgical interventions: hysterectomy and double adnexectomy due to metrorrhagia. Usual treatment: propanolol 10 mg every 8 hours, duloxetine 60 mg every 24 hours.  Present illness The patient was referred from another centre for an episode of loss of consciousness the previous night in bed, witnessed by her husband, who reported snoring, ocular eversion and tonic spasm lasting a few seconds, for which she did not consult. The following morning she presented with precordial pressure and went to the emergency department, where atrial fibrillation with controlled response was observed, which spontaneously reverted to sinus bradycardia with complete cessation of the precordial pressure. He reported almost daily palpitations lasting a few minutes, unrelated to exertion, for the last 2 years, as well as dyspnoea on moderate exertion.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 120/80 mmHg; heart rate (HR) 55 bpm. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented, eupneic, well perfused. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs at rest or with Valsalva manoeuvres. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur with no added sounds. Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis, pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Baseline ECG: sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS with normal axis, biphasic T wave (with predominance of the negative component) in III, aVF, V4 and V5, notched in V2 and V3. QTc 511 ms. Laboratory tests: haemoglobin 12.9 g/dl, leukocytes 6,370/μl, platelets 191.000 /μl, HbA1C 5.5%, total cholesterol 190 mg/dl, HDL 40 mg/dl, LDL 110 mg/dl, triglycerides 130 mg/dl, creatinine 0.63 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate > 90 ml/min, sodium 142 mmol/l, potassium 4.8 mmol/l, CRP 1.1 mg/l, TSH 2.13 μIU/ml, troponin I (hs-TnI) 10, CK 50 U/l. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal size with severe asymmetric septal hypertrophy (IVSd 18 mm; PPd 13 mm) generating acceleration in the LV outflow tract without significant obstruction either at baseline or with Valsalva (maximum gradient 15 mmHg). Preserved global systolic function without segmental alterations of contractility (LVEF 65%). Diastolic pattern compatible with impaired relaxation. Moderately dilated left atrium (area 30 cm2). Preserved RVEF. Mitral valve with good opening and mild mitral insufficiency (MI). No SAM is seen. Poorly visualised aortic valve with trivalve impression and no pathological flow. Poorly visualised tricuspid valve that appears normal without tricuspid insufficiency (TI) that would allow estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PSAP). No indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Inferior vena cava not dilated with adequate inspiratory collapse. Aortic root of normal size with slight dilatation of tubular ascending aorta (40 mm), with non-dilated aortic arch. No pericardial effusion. Post-implantation chest X-ray: bicameral implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) (normo-inserted AD and RV electrodes), surgical clamps, cardiothoracic index within normal, lung parenchyma without alterations, no signs of pneumothorax. Electrocardiogram (ECG) at discharge: atrial activity stimulated by pacemaker at 60 bpm, narrow QRS with normal axis, biphasic T wave in III, aVF, V4 and V5, notched in V2. QTc 480 ms.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION This is a patient with a previous diagnosis of non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with overlapping long QT syndrome type 1 who presented with syncope of cardiogenic profile under beta-blocker treatment. Given the patient's HCM Risk-SCD of 3.52% (low 5-year risk), the nocturnal profile of syncope and family history of nocturnal sudden death (SD), it seems likely that the syncopal event is related to long QT syndrome type 1 rather than to her hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the presence of cardiogenic syncope under beta-blocker treatment, ICD implantation was decided. Given the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the finding of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not previously documented, anticoagulant treatment was started. Bicameral ICD implantation was performed without incident, being programmed in DDDR ICD mode, at a pacing rate of 60 bpm.  DIAGNOSIS Syncope with cardiogenic profile. Non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with overlapping long QT syndrome type 1 (probably pathogenic variant in KCNQ1). Symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (haemodynamic angina in relation to rapid ventricular response). Implantation of bicameral ICD. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Haemogram: haemoglobin 13.5 g/dl, platelets 252,000 per microlitre, 7,790 leukocytes per microlitre with 91% neutrophils and 5.4% lymphocytes. Haemostasis: aPTT 33 sec, prothrombin time 92%, INR 1.1, fibrinogen 652 mg/dl. Knee X-ray: bilateral condocalcinosis, more striking in the right knee. ECG performed with magnesium correction and potassium 3.1 mEq/l: sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute. Normal PR. Narrow QRS. Negative T waves in V1-V2 with Rsr' morphology in V2. Normal QTc. ECG performed with magnesium and potassium correction: sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute. Normal PR. Narrow QRS. No acute repolarisation alterations. Normal QTc. Transthoracic echocardiography: mild ventricular hypertrophy. Preserved LVEF. Flecainide test: after infusion of flecainide at a dose of 2 mg/kg, the patient develops a Brugada type 1 pattern. Genetic test for Brugada syndrome: negative.  CLINICAL COURSE The gonalgia was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with suspicion of a pseudogout crisis due to probable chondrocalcinosis, with complete resolution of the symptoms within several days. In view of the ECG findings described above, the ionic alterations were corrected and the ECG pattern evolved as shown in the images. The patient remained completely asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view, and was discharged with subsequent controls in outpatient electrophysiology consultations, with suspicion of Brugada pattern phenocopy in the context of ionic alterations. A flecainide test was performed on an outpatient basis with intravenous administration of this drug at a dose of 2 mg/kg in 10 minutes, obtaining a Brugada type 1 pattern. He remained in the hospital for several hours with telemetry without observing arrhythmic events. Subsequently, echocardiography was performed without showing notable alterations (preserved LVEF, without significant valvular heart disease). A genetic study of p channelopathies/myocardiopathy was performed, which was negative. The patient has remained asymptomatic in his 73 years of life from the cardiovascular point of view, with no notable family history or sudden deaths. An echocardiogram was also performed without showing any notable alterations (preserved LVEF, no significant valvular heart disease). Therefore, what initially appeared to be only a Brugada pattern phenocopy turned out to be true Brugada syndrome. He was informed of the current process and of the prohibited drugs, prohibition of alcohol and the rapid treatment of fever with antipyretics, which is also reflected in his history. At present, she has also started the family study for the control of her relatives.  DIAGNOSIS Brugada syndrome. No structural heart disease (preserved LVEF). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known allergic drug reactions. Active smoking: 30 cigarettes a day. Morbid obesity. Arterial hypertension. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Dyslipidaemia. Hyperuricaemia. Hypothyroidism. Stage 3B chronic kidney disease (basal glomerular filtration rate 30-35 ml/min). Peripheral arterial disease: intermittent claudication Fontaine grade IIa. Ischaemic heart disease: admitted for unstable angina in 2008. Catheterisation revealed severe damage to three vessels (anterior descending [DA], right coronary [CD], first obtuse marginal [OM]). Only the LAD was surgically revascularised with a left internal mammary artery graft. Usual treatment: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg per day, enalapril 20 mg per day, atenolol 12.5 mg per day, furosemide 40 mg at breakfast and lunch, metformin 850 mg every 12 hours, mixed insulin (regular 30%, isophane 70%) 30 units in the morning and 20 units in the evening, simvastatin 40 mg per day, allopurinol 100 mg per day, eutirox 50 mcg per day, omeprazole 20 mg per day.  Present illness An 84-year-old woman came to the emergency department for an episode of non-radiating central thoracic pain that appeared with minimal effort, lasting minutes and ceased spontaneously, with similar characteristics to her previous angina, although of lesser intensity. While in the emergency department, she presented another episode, during which dynamic electrocardiographic changes were observed, which subsided with the administration of sublingual nitroglycerine. The patient had been asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view since her previous admission in 2008.  Physical examination Vital signs: blood pressure in left arm 125/63 mmHg, in right arm 143/75 mmHg. Heart rate 63 bpm. Oxygen saturation 97% basal. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented, cooperative, normohydrated and normoperfused. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, systolic murmur II/VI predominantly in aortic focus, with second noise present. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, with no added sounds. Abdomen: hydro-aerial sounds preserved, soft and depressible, not painful on palpation. Lower limbs: no oedema, weak distal pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC on admission: haemoglobin 16.6 g/dL without alterations, no leukocytosis. Normal haemostasis. Glucose 152 mg/dl, creatinine 1.44 mg/dl, glomerular filtration 35.20 ml/min, sodium 143 mmol/l, potassium 4.1 mmol/l, chlorine 106 mmol/l, C-reactive protein 3.8 mg/l, two determinations of troponin I 0.0 ng/ml. LDL 119 mg/dl. HbA1c 8.6%. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with chest pain: atrial fibrillation at 95 bpm. Narrow QRS. Low voltages. Infradevelation of 1 mm and ST rectification from V2 to V6, DI and aVL. Painless ECG: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Correction of repolarisation alterations. Coronary angiography: 90% lesion in the mid-segment of the LAD. Mammary bridge to mid-distal LAD is observed, which fills retrograde from the LAD. Dominant circumflex (Cx) chronically occluded from the proximal segment, with poor filling by homocoronary collaterals distally. Poorly developed DC with chronic occlusion in the middle segment, distally filled by homocoronary collateral circulation. The bridge from the mammary to the LAD is patent and without lesions. Significant stenosis is observed at the origin of the left subclavian artery with a pressure gradient across it of 60 mmHg. Angio-CT scan: chronic stenosis of the proximal left subclavian artery about 32 mm from its origin, conditioned by a mixed plaque. The origin of the left internal mammary artery is 11 mm from the plaque. Echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle with preserved ejection fraction. Alterations of segmental contractility in inferior and inferolateral segments. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Biauricular dilatation. No significant valvulopathies.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After finding significant stenosis of the left subclavian artery with compromised flow towards the mammary bypass to the anterior descending artery, CT angiography was performed to evaluate the three-dimensional anatomy of the stenosis. Given the patient's profile and her high surgical risk, percutaneous revascularisation was chosen, with angioplasty and destent implantation in the left subclavian artery, which proceeded without complications. During admission, deterioration of renal function was observed in relation to contrast administration and insufficient fluid intake, which improved with serum therapy, returning to baseline creatinine and glomerular filtration rates. The patient was discharged with special emphasis on the control of cardiovascular risk factors: smoking cessation, heart-healthy diet, weight loss, physical exercise... As for pharmacological treatment of risk factors, liraglutide was added to improve glycaemic control and promote weight loss, and simvastatin 40 mg was replaced by atorvastatin 80 mg to achieve LDL target of less than 55 mg/dl. Regarding the antithrombotic regimen, at discharge, double therapy was prescribed with rivaroxaban 10 mg per day and clopidogrel 75 mg per day, suspending the ASA previously taken by the patient. After the intervention, the patient remained asymptomatic, with no new episodes of chest pain during admission and subsequent follow-up in outpatient clinics.  DIAGNOSIS Unstable angina due to subclavian-coronary steal syndrome. In a patient with severe three-vessel coronary artery disease and partial surgical revascularisation with left internal mammary bypass to anterior descending artery in 2008. Preserved LV systolic function. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in this context. Acute renal failure AKIN III on chronic kidney disease, prerenal origin and iodinated contrast nephrotoxicity. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: smoking and occasional alcohol consumption (very low burden). No other drug use. No arterial hypertension (AHT), no dyslipidaemia, no diabetes mellitus. Cardiological history: no known cardiological history, no family history of heart disease or sudden death in the family. Surgical interventions: tonsillectomy. No usual treatment.  Present illness A 36-year-old male patient came to the emergency department referred from his health centre for palpitations and syncope, with an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing irregular tachycardia with wide QRS. After getting up quickly from the sofa, the patient reported sudden onset of palpitations, without initial dizziness. Subsequently, after approximately one minute, he went to the bathroom to urinate and after urinating, he reported a rapid sensation of dizziness and fell to the floor, with spontaneous recovery of consciousness (he reported approximately 10 minutes of loss of consciousness, he was alone at home, with no witnesses). After the episode, he reported only palpitations, denying chest pain, dyspnoea or other symptoms. Given the persistence of the palpitations and after recovering from the syncope, he decided to consult his health centre and was referred to our centre. The patient denies the use of toxic substances. He reported 4 similar episodes of palpitations related to physical effort for which he had never consulted before, self-limited, without syncope.  Physical examination On arrival at the emergency department, good general condition, normal colour, normohydrated, eupneic at rest. Blood pressure (BP) 147/68 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 180-210 bpm. SpO2 (FiO2 21%) 99%. Neurological examination: conscious and oriented, alert, cooperative. No neurological focality. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation: irregular tachycardic sounds, no murmurs. Preserved vesicular murmur (VCM), without added noises. Abdomen soft, depressible, without masses or megaliths. No pain on palpation. No signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower limbs: no oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS  ECG: Initial ECG on arrival at the ED: wide QRS irregular tachycardia with approximate ventricular response between 180-210 bpm. Occasionally there are narrow QRS beats. ECG after CVE: sinus rhythm at 95 bpm, PR 100 ms, 60o axis, QRS 120 ms with positive delta wave in inferior aspect and from V3 to V5. No repolarisation abnormalities. ECG at discharge: sinus rhythm 80 bpm. PR 150 msg. Narrow QRS without repolarisation alterations.  Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index (CTI) within normal, no condensation or pleural effusion, no signs of pneumothorax.  Laboratory tests: CBC: red blood cells 5.08 10*12/l, haemoglobin 15.6 g/dl, haematocrit 47%, leukocytes * 11.6 10*9/l, neutrophils 50.5%, lymphocytes 38.3%, platelets 295 10*9/l. Biochemistry: glucose * 111 mg/dl, sodium 139 mEq/l, potassium 3.6 mEq/l, chlorine 102 mEq/l, GPT 39 U/l, urea 23.1 mg/dl, creatinine 0.87 mg/dl, C-reactive protein 0.06 mg/dl. Baseline haemostasis: prothrombin time 10.3 sec; I. Quick 99; INR 1.02; aPTT 25.9 sec. Echocardiogram: left ventricle with preserved diameters and global systolic function. Absence of alterations in segmental contractility at rest. Trivial mitral insufficiency. Aortic root 36 mm, without valvulopathies. Right ventricle of preserved size and function. Minimal tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating PAPs of approximately 30 mmHg. Normal inferior vena cava. Electrophysiological study (EEF): on ECG suspicion of a possible left lateral accessory pathway, access was gained via the retrograde aortic route and an ablation catheter was located in the lateral mitral annulus, obtaining precocities of up to -10 ms with respect to delta wave and QS in unipolar, performing 3 applications of RF reaching up to 56 oC temperature with cessation of anterograde and retrograde conduction of the pathway. With programmed st. A programmed (600/260), orthodromic tachycardia is induced by another left posterior accessory pathway and ablation is performed during tachycardia, observing cessation of tachycardia with a V without rising to A. After this, no eccentric retrograde conduction is observed and tachycardia is not induced. The result was maintained after 20 min of waiting and the procedure was terminated.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the emergency department of our centre, given the clinical and ECG findings at the health centre, the patient was transferred directly to the critical care unit. An ECG was performed with persistent wide QRS irregular tachycardia and, given haemodynamic stability and good clinical tolerance to the tachycardia, pharmacological cardioversion was decided with procainamide 200 mg i.v. without cessation of tachycardia. Subsequently, the patient was sedated with 2 mg of midazolam and 6 mg of etomidate, and electrical cardioversion (ECV) was performed with a 200 J shock, and the patient went into sinus rhythm at 75 bpm. The post-CVE ECG showed sinus rhythm with short PR with delta wave + in inferior and lateral leads. In light of the ECGs, the patient was labelled as having syncopal pre-excited atrial fibrillation and was admitted to cardiology with continuous monitoring to complete the study and treatment. During his stay in cardiology the patient remained asymptomatic and without arrhythmic events on monitoring. Morphological studies were completed with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which showed no significant alterations. The convenience of performing accessory pathway ablation was explained to the patient, as well as the risks of not doing so, and the patient accepted the procedure. In the EPS, 2 accessory pathways were located (left lateral and left posterior) and both were effectively ablated. In the absence of complications 24 hours after the procedure, the patient was discharged home with ECG with no signs of pre-excitation.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Male, 41 years old, from Romania. Hypertensive and smoker. History of syncope: 1999 in Romania: attributed according to the patient to a first CHF episode (no reports available). 2012: non-specific symptoms with suspected vasovagal aetiology. 2015: new episode with prodromes and post-critical period, leading to a neurological study with cranial computed tomography (CT), which was found to be normal. 2016: two episodes, with a cardiogenic profile. Admission to the cardiology ward. She came to the emergency department for two consecutive syncopal episodes, the first of which was not witnessed, while walking, without prodromes, with a fall to the ground and trauma to the jaw and mouth. While recovering from this (he got up and went to drink water), he had another episode, this time preceded by intense heat and dizziness, with loss of consciousness lasting seconds. Subsequent full recovery. No tonic-clonic movements or sphincter relaxation. Subsequently asymptomatic. No clinical chest pain or palpitations. No dyspnoea or signs of heart failure.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 144/91 mmHg, Spo2 99%, heart rate (HR) 72 bpm. Conscious and oriented. Eupneic. Cardiopulmonary auscultation normal. Lower limbs: no oedema. Palpable and symmetrical pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 52 bpm, 90o axis, narrow QRS, asymmetric negative T in III and up to V2, biphasic in V3. Notched QRS in V3. Early repolarisation in V6. Chest X-ray: cardiac shift to the left. Erasure of the right cardiac border (overlapping of the spinal column). Pectus excavatum. CBC: ultrasensitive troponin T 4 pg/ml. Glucose 85 mg/dl, urea 35 mg/dl, creatinine 0.95 mg/dl. Sodium 137 mmol/l. Potassium 4.2 mmol/l. CK 279 U/l. Haemoglobin 14.5 x10^3/mcl, platelets 304x10^3/mcl, leucocytes 13.29x10^3/mcl (N 86%). D-dimer 198 μg/ml. PET scan protocol: no repletion defects in main, lobar or segmental pulmonary arteries. No mediastinal or hilar adenopathies of significant size. No images compatible with infiltrates, nodules or pleural effusion. Echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) not dilated or hypertrophic with preserved LVEF and no alterations in segmental contractility except septal flattening and anomalous movement in relation to right ventricular dilatation. Non-dilated left atrium (LA) with an AP diameter of 26 mm and area of 14 cm. Dilated right ventricle (RV) with diameters of 45 mm basally, 40 mm medially and 59 mm longitudinally with borderline RVEF (TAPSE 16, S DTI 14) with free wall hypokinesia and akinesia-dyskinesia at the apex. Aortic root and ascending aorta not dilated. Tricommissural aortic valve with preserved opening. Mitral and tricuspid of normal morphology. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated. Aneurysm of the interatrial septum (AIS) that appears to be intact. No pericardial effusion is visualised. Normal diastolic function. Trivial mitral regurgitation (MR). Mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Signal-averaged ECG: filtered QRS duration: 108 ms, RMS40: 37 mcV, SAB: 23 ms. No positive criteria. Negative signal averaging study. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): morphological and functional sequences show non-dilated LV with normal wall thickness and normal global and regional EF. Normal LA. RA not dilated. RV not dilated, with estimated RVEF 47%. At the level of the RV outflow tract, a very localised hypokinetic area, with no other significant alterations in segmental contractility or aneurysmal areas. Cardiac displacement towards the left hemithorax, with significant horizontalisation of the cardiac axis. No oedema is seen in T2 sequences. Perfusion sequences do not show any first-pass defects. No enhancement indicating pathological substrate was observed in the viability sequences. Extracardiac findings: lungs with normal vascularisation, although there is volume loss in lingular segments associated with cardiac displacement.  Conclusion: Normal LV. RV not dilated, with borderline EF (47%), without conclusive data for diagnosis of dysplasia. Electrophysiological study: negative study, no data of channelopathy. At the end of the study and to complete the study, a SJM model Confirm DM2100 subcutaneous Holter was implanted. Coronary CAT scan (image 4): normal cardiac cavities. Atria not dilated. Aortic valve: tricuspid, morphologically normal. Mitral valve: morphologically normal. Coronary tree: Agatston 0. Dominance: right. Normal coronary anatomy. No abnormalities or stenosis. Rotation of the cardiac silhouette to the left and posterior and virtual absence of the pericardium, with some residual tracts in the anterior margin of the right ventricle.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward for further investigation. In the emergency department, angio-CT ruled out PTE. Initially, right ventricular dysplasia was suspected (ECG with negative T1-V2, echocardiogram with a doubtful aneurysmal image in the right ventricle), so the study was completed with MRI and a new echocardiogram was repeated: the right ventricle was of normal size, without dilatation or clear criteria of dysplasia. During admission, he remained asymptomatic and stable, without dizziness or syncope and with telemetry that did not record any event (no ventricular or supraventricular extrasystoles or arrhythmias of any kind). The syncope study was completed with signal-averaged ECG, flecainide test and electrophysiological study with no inducibility of ventricular tachycardia or findings justifying an arrhythmic mechanism. A subcutaneous Holter was implanted. A coronary CAT scan was also performed which ruled out coronary anomalies, with probable almost total agenesis of the left pericardium (chest X-ray also compatible with this diagnosis), which does not justify the current clinical picture.  DIAGNOSIS Repeated syncope of non-filarial origin (probably neuromediated). Negative electrophysiological study. Implantable Holter. Coronary CAT scan with no coronary lesions or anomalies. Almost total pericardial agenesis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Deep negative T waves from V2 to V6, less pronounced negative T waves in DI, aVL and DII.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Woman with angina at rest, ECG without repolarisation alterations, ultrasensitive troponin T elevation and apical akinesia. Given the suspicion of tako-tsubo syndrome versus previous high-risk NSTEACS, it was decided to admit her to the coronary unit for monitoring and clinical surveillance. Pending invasive coronary angiography, treatment was started with double antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation with enoxaparin (INR below 2). During the first 24 hours the patient remained asymptomatic, without new episodes of pain, haemodynamically and respiratory stable, with no arrhythmic events on telemetry. Given her clinical stability, it was decided to transfer her to the hospital ward with telemetry the day after her admission, pending catheterisation. However, a few hours after his admission to the ward, he started again with chest pain of similar characteristics to the previous one, this time presenting ST segment elevation from V3 to V5, so emergent catheterisation was performed. The catheterisation showed spontaneous dissection at the level of the distal LAD, with very distal occlusion that was not considered susceptible to percutaneous treatment, and it was decided to implant an intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation device to improve coronary perfusion. The patient was readmitted to the coronary unit, maintaining the previously established treatment with double antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel + ASA) and anticoagulation with enoxaparin. While stable, 12 hours after the catheterisation, she suddenly began to feel unwell, with sinus tachycardia and hypotension up to 50/30 mmHg, with rapid worsening and deterioration of the level of consciousness. Echocardioscopy showed severe hyperechogenic pericardial effusion not previously present, with involvement of the right chambers. Suspicion of cardiac tamponade secondary to cardiac rupture led to orotracheal intubation, emergency pericardiocentesis with scant haemorrhagic fluid output, and the cardiac surgery team was notified for emergency surgery. Noradrenaline perfusion is started at increasing doses, intensive serum therapy and several red blood cell concentrates are transfused. On arrival of the cardiac surgeons, an urgent sternotomy was performed in the coronary unit box with extraction of abundant clots and visualisation of active bleeding in the apical infarcted region, making it difficult to contain the bleeding. He presented with brief CRA due to AESP which returned after direct cardiac massage and digital tamponade of the bleeding point. After obtaining systolic blood pressure (SBP) figures of around 70-100 mmHg, the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery operating theatre and the apical defect was repaired with direct suture and BioGlue, which proved difficult due to the extensive friable area, with the need for resternotomy after further bleeding on the first attempt to transfer him to the coronary unit. After surgery, she was admitted to the coronary unit sedated, well adapted to the ventilator in "Pressure Controlled Volume" mode with standard parameters, with continuous perfusion of dobutamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline for mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 100 mmHg, with 1:1 balloon counterpulsation. In the days following this event, she remained sedated and intubated, requiring inotropic and vasoactive drugs, although progressively at lower doses. Persistent anuria, so on the third day of admission she consulted the nephrology department, which started haemofiltration. On the fourth day and again suddenly, he presented a new episode of severe hypotension up to 40-50 mmHg with 500 ml of rapid haematic output in the thoracic drainage tubes. Echocardioscopy was performed and showed cardiac tamponade secondary to effusion and the presence of clots in the right chambers. In view of the findings, cardiac surgery was immediately notified and the sternotomy was opened in the same room, extracting abundant clots from the pericardial sac, again visualising apical tearing with abundant active bleeding. They proceeded to perform multiple stitches with Teflon support. During the procedure, he presented severe arterial hypotension requiring high doses of catecholamines (noradrenaline and adrenaline, as well as repeated boluses of phenylephrine). Sternotomy was left open with a Bogotá bag until 48 hours later, when sternal closure was performed as scheduled, which passed without incident. The patient was subsequently admitted to the coronary unit for a further 21 days, with a slow but favourable clinical evolution. In the control echocardiogram prior to discharge to the ward, a progressive improvement in biventricular function was observed, with LVEF of 48%, due to the presence of a patch in the apex, drawing attention to the existence of a 1 cm pseudoaneurysm in the junctions of the middle segment with the apical segment of the inferior face. After improvement in renal function, a CT angiography of the coronary arteries was requested on the ward, showing an aneurysm and apical and lower apical polylobulated pseudoaneurysm. After discussing the case with cardiac surgery, given the high risk of reoperation, conservative medical treatment was decided. After a total of 74 days in hospital, the patient was discharged home with haemodialysis sessions scheduled every other day, and is currently progressively recovering renal function, asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view, pending an outpatient echocardiogram. Medication at discharge: omeprazole 20 mg at breakfast, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg at lunch, enoxaparin 40 mg intra-dialysis circuit on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays and subcutaneous the rest of the days, carvedilol 6.25 mg 1 every 12 hours, atorvastatin 20 mg at dinner.  DIAGNOSIS Main diagnosis: Killip I anterior STEMI. Spontaneous distal LAD dissection with distal vessel occlusion, not amenable to coronary intervention. CRA by pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in the context of cardiac tamponade due to rupture of the free wall of the left ventricle, on two occasions.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  50-year-old male, no known drug allergies. No toxic habits. No cardiovascular risk factors. No relevant family history. No medical or surgical history. No chronic treatments.  First consultation: Referred to cardiology consultation from the emergency department. He had consulted for an episode of palpitations and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) was identified, which slowed with vagal manoeuvres but was reversed with IV atenolol. Physical examination was unaltered. At the consultation, the diagnosis of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia was established and it was decided to start treatment with beta-blockers (bisoprolol 2.5 mg at breakfast), request 24-hour Holter and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).  Second consultation (at 5 months): In the time between consultations, he attended the emergency department three times for palpitations related to SVT episodes that sometimes reverted with vagal manoeuvres. Several medication changes due to intolerance or ineffectiveness. At the time of the second assessment she was on atenolol 50 mg c/24 hours. Prior to the consultation, a TTE was performed which showed dilatation of the right chambers with normal RV systolic function and PSAP 26 + PVC. An agitated saline test was performed with no evidence of bubble passage between cavities, which was interpreted as an improbable sign of shunt. 24-hour Holter in sinus rhythm with adequate heart rate (HR) and one episode of non-sustained SVT (< 30 seconds).  Given the frequency of tachyarrhythmic episodes, the patient was referred to the electrophysiology department for evaluation of ablation. In view of the echocardiographic findings, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested in order to try to identify the aetiology of the dilatation of the right chambers. Electrophysiology consultation: It was decided to request an electrophysiological study and ablation in the face of symptomatic and recurrent TPSV of one year's evolution, despite beta-blockers and which were suppressed by vagal manoeuvres.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) in the emergency department: supraventricular rhythm at 120 bpm, one sinus beat and in the rest with variable RP-PR intervals and RP > 70ms. Narrow QRS with 60o axis. ST-segment depression of 1mm from V3-V5. Baseline ECG: sinus rhythm. No data of pre-excitation. No other specific alterations. CBC: glucose 108 mg/dl, urea 48 mg/dl, creatinine 0.86 mg/dl, sodium 137 mEq/l, potassium 4.2 mEq/l, TSH 1.83 mU/l, haemoglobin 16.6 g/dl, leucocytes 9250/microL, platelets 331000/microL. 24-hour Holter: 24-hour electrocardiographic recording. Sinus rhythm throughout the tracing, mean HR 85 bpm. No significant block or pauses. Streak of non-sustained supraventricular tachycardia. TTE: right ventricular dilatation (RV/LV ratio 1.1, baseline DTD 55 mm and RV outflow tract 43 mm), with preserved systolic function. Mild functional tricuspid regurgitation. Estimated PSAP of 26 mmHg (+PVC). Non-dilated left ventricle with normal wall thickness. Preserved systolic function. Prolonged relaxation. No significant valvulopathies. TTE with agitated saline: injection of agitated saline without bubbles passing into the left cavities either at baseline or after the Valsalva manoeuvre. The existence of intra- or extracardiac shunt is unlikely.  MRI of the heart: Conclusion: LV of normal size and systolic function. No areas of hypertrophy, no compaction or late enhancement. Dilated RV with normal systolic function. Extracardiac left-right shunt due to anomalous venous drainage from the right superior pulmonary vein to the superior vena cava with Qp/Qs of 1.7.  Most relevant data: RV: dilated, without morphological alterations, with VTD of 125 ml/m2 (range 55-105 ml/m2) and STV of 51 ml/m2 (range 15-43 ml/m2). EF 59%, cardiac output 7.9 l/min and stroke volume/beat 149 ml. Normal contractility. Anomalous venous drainage from the right superior pulmonary vein to the superior vena cava. LA: area 21 cm2, slightly dilated. RA: area of 29 cm2, slightly dilated. Flow quantification in aortic root (phase contrast velocity coding). Anterograde volume 80 ml and retrograde volume 4.7 ml. Regurgitation fraction: 5.9%. Quantification of flow in main pulmonary artery (phase contrast velocity coding). Anterograde volume 139 ml and retrograde volume 4 ml. Regurgitation fraction: 3%. Qp/Qs: 1.7.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In the time until the next consultation, an electrophysiological study was carried out with the finding of focal atrial tachycardia, with greater precocities at the level of the superior vena cava to the RA. Radiofrequency ablation of the focus was performed and proved effective. As can be seen in the results of the cardiac MRI, an anomalous pulmonary venous connection (APVC) was found due to drainage of the right superior pulmonary vein to the superior vena cava, which caused a volume overload of the right cavities that explained the dilatation, with a significant left-right conshunt (Qp/Qs 1.7). No evidence of other associated defects. After ablation, the episodes of supraventricular tachycardia ceased and the patient was in very good functional class. At this time, according to the adult congenital heart disease guidelines (AHA/ACC 2018), we find that surgical repair in our patient has a grade IIA recommendation: "surgery may be useful for partial anomalous connections of both left and right pulmonary veins, in asymptomatic adults with RV volume overload, left-right shunt large enough to cause physiological sequelae (e.g., QP/QS > or = 1.7), and in those with a left-right shunt large enough to cause physiological sequelae (e.g., QP/QS > or = 1.7), and in those with a left-right shunt large enough to cause physiological sequelae (e.g., QP/QS > or = 1.7)". QP/QS >or= 1.5), in the presence of pulmonary pressures that are 50% lower than systemic pressures and pulmonary resistances less than one third of systemic pressures". It was decided to refer the patient to the adult congenital heart disease clinic where the need to request a right heart catheterisation to complete the haemodynamic study will be assessed before referring to cardiac surgery for repair.  DIAGNOSIS Anomalous pulmonary venous connection: drainage from right superior pulmonary vein to superior vena cava. Significant left-right shunt with right ventricular volume overload. Normal RV systolic function. Focal atrial tachycardia. Radiofrequency ablation effective. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 59-year-old man, hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic, with a history of Bentall surgery with implantation of a mechanical aortic prosthesis and a valved tube, as well as coronary revascularisation in the same procedure by means of a bypass of the left internal mammary artery to the anterior descending artery, in its middle segment. This intervention took place 4 years ago. She has no other personal history of interest. On treatment with acenocoumarol, atorvastatin 40 mg/day, enalapril 10 mg/day and bisoprolol 2.5 mg/day. At the present time, she presented to the emergency department with fever, shivering and marked asthenia of 24 hours' evolution, with no other associated clinical manifestations or epidemiological history of interest. On arrival, he presented with fever (temperature 39°C) and hypotension (BP 85/45 mmHg), as well as sinus tachycardia (110 bpm). SatO2 90% on room air. Poor peripheral perfusion with coldness of acral parts. High jugular venous pressure. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, prosthetic sounds. Pulmonary auscultation: crackles in both bases. Lower extremities without oedema. The initial examinations and complementary tests revealed a situation of hyperlactacidemic metabolic acidosis, which appeared serious, with haemoglobin levels of 12.7 g/dl and leukocytes of 11,500 with neutrophilia (80%), and blood cultures were taken a few minutes after arrival.  In this context, volume expansion, empirical antibiotic therapy with cloxacillin, ampicillin and gentamicin was started, as well as administration of vasoactive drugs, and he was admitted to the intensive care unit. Initially, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, with no data suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Two days after admission, the patient developed marked right hemiparesis, and an emergency CT scan and cranial MRI scan were performed, showing the presence of a 2 x 2 cm intraparenchymal cerebral haemorrhage at the level of the left prerirolandic cortex, interrupting his anticoagulant treatment (prescribed by his mechanical prosthesis). At this point in his evolution, the results of the blood cultures taken were positive for Staphylococcus aureus, and given the high suspicion of infective endocarditis, a cerebral angiography was performed which ruled out the presence of mycotic aneurysms. Given the existence of a transesophageal echocardiogram 3 days earlier with no signs of endocarditis, a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) was performed, which revealed abnormal uptake in the aortic valve prosthesis and in the aortic peritubular area. CT reconstruction showed periaortic thickening, with irregular contour and peripheral late enhancement, compatible with the existence of a periaortic abscess. No abnormal uptake of 18F-FDG was observed in extracardiac locations. At this point, the patient already met the criteria for infective endocarditis (1 major and 3 minor criteria) due to S. aureus on the prosthetic aortic valve and valved tube. Three days later, a new transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which documented the presence of a large aortic vegetation of 11 mm in greatest diameter. At this point, one of the first debates in the patient's evolution arose, with the complex decision to choose the optimal time for surgery, which was postponed due to intracranial bleeding. As for the clinical situation at this time, the patient remained afebrile and progressively experienced an ad integrum recovery of his neurological deficits. 18 days after his admission, after an apparent good evolution, 6 days before his scheduled surgery, he presented with sudden abdominal pain, arterial hypotension and a syncopal episode, and an urgent venous blood gas analysis showed acute anaemisation with Hb of 6 g/dl. Intravenous crystalloids and red cell concentrates were administered. An emergency abdominal ultrasound showed the presence of free intra-abdominal fluid compatible with haemoperitoneum, and a large splenic haematoma, and he was readmitted to the intensive care unit. Thus, with the diagnosis of acute abdomen, urgent abdominal surgery was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of haemoperitoneum and acute splenic rupture, making it necessary to proceed with a splenectomy to contain the bleeding, with subsequent anatomopathological analysis confirming the aetiology of the aforementioned splenic rupture as secondary to septic embolism. Five days later, when the patient was once again on the hospital ward, he presented with severe rectorrhagia with anaemia and haemodynamic instability, requiring transfusion of haemoconcentrates. Initially, endoscopic management was performed and a diagnosis was made of stress gastropathy with multiple duodenal ulcers, treated by implantation of haemoclips. Despite all this, the bleeding recurred on two occasions, so that emergency surgery was finally necessary, and a partial duodenectomy was performed, removing the affected segment.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Finally, one month after the initial admission, his cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis was performed and the infected material was replaced by a new mechanical aortic prosthesis and a valved tube. S. aureus growth was confirmed in the removed prosthetic material. On the fifth day post-surgery, the patient presented with dizziness and severe arterial hypotension and tachycardia, and a transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, and he underwent urgent pericardiectomy, with an apparent good result. After his return to the hospital ward, a control echocardiogram was performed to rule out further complications, which revealed the presence of a pericardial haematoma measuring 6 x 7 x 9 cm, involving the right atrium, which had to be evacuated again in the operating theatre. Finally, the patient managed to complete the 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy, without presenting new complications, and was discharged after 7 weeks of hospitalisation. Currently, 2 years after his infective endocarditis due to S. aureus, he is asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view.  DIAGNOSIS Late prosthetic infective endocarditis due to S. aureus. Aortic valve and tube replacement in ascending aorta. Complicated with: Intraparenchymal cerebral haemorrhage secondary to septic embolism. Acute abdomen due to splenic rupture due to septic embolism. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to duodenal stress ulcers. Partial duodenectomy. Post-surgical cardiac tamponade. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

In the first 24 hours, cardiac catheterisation showed a suboccluded circumflex artery with anomalous origin from the right coronary sinus adjacent to the ostium of the right coronary artery, with a retroaortic trajectory, which received collateral circulation from the right coronary artery. Given the favourable coronary anatomy, two overlapping drug-eluting stents were implanted over the circumflex artery and one drug-eluting stent over the significant lesion in the posterior descending artery. The patient had a good clinical evolution during his admission, with no heart failure or arrhythmic events. No clinical events occurred after three months of outpatient follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation of lateral location. Evolution to non-Q AMI. Killip I. Anomalous origin of circumflex coronary artery from right coronary sinus with retroaortic course. Two-vessel coronary artery disease: circumflex artery suboccluded at the origin, significant stenosis in the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery. Complete percutaneous revascularisation with drug-eluting stents. Preserved left ventricular systolic function. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

After standing: HR 70 bpm, QT 500 ms, QTc 559 ms. Genetic test (channelopathy panel): negative.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was referred by her primary care physician due to a routine ECG finding of LBBB. The ECG at the consultation confirmed this finding together with the presence of secondary repolarisation alterations, a QT of 480 ms and a QTc of 470 ms. The patient denied at all times having presented any symptoms, denying syncopal episodes, palpitations or chest pain on exertion. Given the electrical alterations, it was decided to complete the study with an echocardiogram, which showed a left ventricle with mild concentric hypertrophy of its walls with normal function and mild degenerative aortic insufficiency, with the rest of the study compatible with normality. Myocardial SPECT was also requested, which ruled out the presence of ischaemia. To complete the study of the suspected long QT syndrome, the Viskin standing test was performed, which showed a lengthening of the QTc interval, from 480 ms in the supine position after 10 minutes of rest to 559 ms after standing. An ergometry test was also performed with baseline QTc and at maximum exercise, presence of isolated ventricular extrasystoles and QTc in recovery of 490 ms. Finally, a 24-hour Holter is requested without observing arrhythmic events or T wave alternation. Based on these tests, the patient was diagnosed with asymptomatic long QT syndrome (LQTS) and treatment was started with beta-blockers (bisoprolol 2.5 mg per day). In addition, a genetic study was requested, but it was negative. Subsequently, the patient explained to us that her two maternal cousins had been diagnosed with LQTS but both had a negative genetic study. Currently the patient remains asymptomatic, with no cardiac events during follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Long QT syndrome (negative genetics). Mild aortic insufficiency. Normal systolic function. Complete left bundle branch block. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 65-year-old male referred preferentially from primary care to cardiology outpatient clinics due to chest pain.

No family history of heart disease. Other history: glaucoma, peptic ulcus. Treatment: omeprazole 20 mg: 1 tablet per day. Latanoprost, dorzolamide and timolol eye drops.  Present illness He reported chest pain in the left hemithorax with oppressive characteristics, without irradiation, sometimes accompanied by cold sweating, generally triggered by exertion, although there were also some episodes at rest, and progressive improvement of the pain in about 30 minutes after cessation of exertion. The patient denied changes in the threshold of exertion or progression of the symptoms in recent weeks. He reported no symptoms suggestive of heart failure, palpitations or episodes of loss of consciousness.  Physical examination Good general condition, normal colour and normohydrated, eupneic at rest and conscious, oriented and cooperative. Blood pressure (BP) 124/73 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 55 bpm, SatO2 98% on room air. No murmurs were detected on cardiac auscultation and pulmonary auscultation showed a preserved vesicular murmur with no added noises except for some isolated tele-expiratory wheezing. Radial and pedial pulses were palpable, rhythmic and symmetrical.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Basal electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 55 beats per minute. Axis 60o. PR 0.16s. Narrow QRS. No repolarisation alterations. Laboratory tests: glucose 91 mg/dl, creatinine 0.78 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) over 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, total cholesterol 172 mg/dl, triglycerides 71 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 54 mg/dl, calculated LDL cholesterol 113 mg/dl. Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle of normal diameter and wall thickness with preserved LVEF (67%). No segmental alterations in contractility were observed. Normal transmitral filling pattern. Mean E/e" of 9.5 (LVEDP globally estimated as normal). Non-dilated right ventricle with good contractility (TAPSE 21 mm, s" tricuspid annulus 13.2 cm/s). Atria of normal size. No relevant valvulopathies. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with adequate inspiratory collapse. Absence of pericardial effusion. Ergometry on treadmill: maximum ergometry with Bruce protocol on a moving treadmill, the test was stopped due to oppressive, non-limiting precordial pain, similar to that which motivated the request, and maximum horizontal ST depression of 2 mm in 5 leads (II, III, aVF, V4 and V5); both the clinical and ECG changes persisted for about 5 minutes after the end of the effort. Correct adaptation of HR and BP. Normal functional capacity (reaches 12.6 METS). No significant arrhythmias detected. Coronary angiography (video 2): left dominance. Left coronary trunk, anterior descending artery and circumflex artery without significant angiographic lesions. Right coronary artery with anomalous origin from left coronary sinus and probable interarterial trajectory, of scarce development and without significant angiographic lesions. CT of the coronary arteries with cardiac synchronisation and prospective acquisition: coronary anatomy: left dominance. Intermediate branch as an anatomical variant of normality. Anomalous right coronary outflow from left coronary sinus with high interarterial course. Left main coronary artery: long, without lesions. Anterior descending: no lesions. Circumflex: no lesions. Right coronary artery: outflow from contralateral coronary sinus with high interarterial course, without lesions. Other cardiac findings: small diverticulum in the left inferoposterior wall of the left atrium. No intra-atrial thrombus. Extracardiac findings: hiatal hernia. Stress cardiac MRI with dipyridamole: left ventricle with wall thickness, volumes and segmental and global systolic function within normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricle volume and systolic function within normal (LVEF 64%). Atria and great vessels of normal size. Provocation of ischaemia with i.v. dipyridamole (0.84 mg/kg, well tolerated) NEGATIVE. Basal 57 bpm and 137/76 mmHg. Stress 84 bpm and 127/70 mmHg. Absence of myocardial fibrosis or necrosis. In short, absence of inducible ischaemia.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Following the echocardiographic assessment, which showed no structural heart disease, the available data, the clinical management recommendations at that time, the local availability of complementary tests and estimating an intermediate pretest probability, treadmill exercise testing was requested to assess the presence of ischaemia and confirm the diagnosis of suspected stable exertional angina. This was clinically and electrically compatible with high-load ischaemia. With this result and the patient's clinical presentation, treatment was started with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg 1 tablet per day and atorvastatin 20 mg 1 tablet per day, and coronary angiography was requested. During the technique, cannulation of the left main coronary artery showed left-dominant anterior descending and circumflex arteries without significant lesions. The right coronary artery could not be cannulated from the right coronary sinus, so the origin of the right coronary artery was sought in the left coronary sinus. After several attempts and sub-selective injections, the right coronary artery was found to have an anomalous origin in the left coronary sinus, with a probable interarterial course. The artery itself was poorly developed and practically rudimentary. To confirm the origin and especially the course of the right coronary artery, a coronary CT scan was requested, which showed, in agreement with the coronary angiography, an origin from the left sinus, as well as a high interarterial course. The patient was presented at a medical-surgical session to consider reimplantation of the right coronary artery, parietal resection or unroofing or bypass with proximal ligation. It was decided to request an imaging test to assess and locate the presence of ischaemia as additional data to indicate possible surgery. Antianginal treatment was added sequentially with nitrate patch 5 mg per day, lercanidipine 10 mg 1 tablet per day and ranolazine 500 mg 1 tablet every 12 hours. Beta-blockers were not tolerated due to a tendency to sinus bradycardia. A stress CMR with vasodilator (dipyridamole) was performed, which ruled out the presence of myocardial necrosis and also showed no evidence of ischaemia. It should be noted that the mechanism of stress induction by this technique (vasodilatation) did not produce an increase in BP, so there would have been no evidence of ischaemia if the mechanism had been compression of the coronary artery with interarterial trajectory by expansion of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, a mechanism that would have occurred if the stress induction had been due to exertion. Finally, surgery by cardiac surgery was ruled out due to the small calibre and development of the affected artery, the technical difficulties of the intervention and the good response to medical treatment. To date, the patient remains stable with a CCS (Canadian Cardiovascular Society) functional class for angina II/IV, pending full optimisation of anti-anginal treatment. He has had no cardiovascular events during follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Coronary anomaly: right coronary artery with origin in left coronary sinus and high interarterial path. Stable angina. Normal LVEF |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History This is a 73-year-old woman with arterial hypertension as a cardiovascular risk factor. She was assessed by cardiology in a private centre for mitral prolapse, with normal ventricular function and asymptomatic during follow-up. Her main comorbidity is oncological, with a history of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the descending colon stage II (pT3 pN0 cM0), which debuted with intestinal obstruction in 2014, initially treated with total colectomy in August 2014, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with Gramont scheme with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) x 12 cycles (last cycle date: February 2015). A CT scan in December 2015 revealed millimetric lung lesions, which were observed until their growth was confirmed by PET scan in June 2016, so first-line chemotherapy with FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid) was started, with oxaliplatin being discontinued after 7 cycles due to neurotoxicity. She was maintained on 5-fluorouracil until the present day, achieving stabilisation of the disease  Current disease While the patient was in the supermarket, she had an apparently sudden loss of consciousness and cardiorespiratory arrest was observed, and basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) manoeuvres were started immediately by the health personnel present. The semi-automatic external defibrillator (AED) detected a shockable rhythm and 2 shocks were administered, with recovery of pulse and consciousness, and orotracheal intubation was not required. The output electrocardiogram (ECG) showed complete right bundle branch block, with no evidence of acute ischaemia. She was transferred by the out-of-hospital emergency services to our centre, where she arrived haemodynamically stable, conscious and oriented. On initial anamnesis, the patient reported short episodes (2 minutes) of chest pain in the previous days, at rest, with no other associated symptoms.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 115/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 74 bpm. Good general condition, conscious and oriented, eupneic at rest. Normoperfused. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur with no extra sounds. Lower limbs: no oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS EGC: sinus rhythm at 80lpm. Normal PR. QRS 120 msec with BCRDHH morphology. No significant repolarisation alterations. Blood tests (on admission): normal haemogram. Normal coagulation except D-dimer 4477 ng/ml. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.38, pCO2 35 mmHg, bicarbonate 21 mEq/l, lactate 4.2 mmol/l. In the biochemistry normal renal function, without ionic alterations and with negative acute phase reactants. Cardiac markers: evolution of ultrasensitive troponin I 7.7 - 174 - 40 ng/ml, with normal CK. Nt-proBNP 457 pg/ml. Chest X-ray on admission: normal cardiothoracic index, no evidence of heart failure. Control chest X-ray after ICD implantation: subcutaneous defibrillator with pre-sternal electrode. Minimal subcutaneous emphysema. Subcutaneous reservoir with terminal at the confluence of the brachiocephalic venous trunks. Urgent coronary angiography: access via right radial artery. 177 cc of contrast. Left coronary trunk without lesions. Anterior descending artery of small calibre and development with a non-significant lesion in the distal portion (corresponding to the middle third of the theoretical trajectory) with a blurred image and with a distal vessel of small development and calibre. Coronary anomaly with middle and distal portion of the anterior descending artery with exit from the right coronary sinus, close to the exit of the right coronary artery. Circumflex and right coronary without lesions. Echocardiogram: left ventricle not dilated, with normal wall thickness. Normal global systolic function (LVEF 60-65%), hypokinesia of inferior septum and inferior face. Transmitral filling pattern of impaired relaxation. E/e' ratio 6. Left atrium not dilated. Non-dilated right atrium. Non-dilated right ventricle, with normal global systolic function. Mitral valve with calcium in the annulus and leaflets. No stenosis. Slight insufficiency. Aortic valve morphologically and functionally normal. Tricuspid valve morphologically normal. Slight insufficiency. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure not estimable. Inferior vena cava not dilated with physiological inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. Epicardial fat. Non-dilated aortic root. Cardiac magnetic resonance: study within normal limits. No areas of myocardial inflammation or ischaemic scarring. Biventricular size and systolic function within normal limits. CT coronary arteries: calcium quantification (Agatston) 410 (80th percentile for age, sex and race). CT angiography: extensive coronary atheromatosis. Anterior descending artery that exhausts at the proximal-middle level of the IV anterior sulcus. Ectopic vessel originating in the right sinus running anterior to the TAP that reaches the IV groove at mid level. It has a concentric stenosis at its origin of 30%.  Assessment by medical oncology: in the absence of further information, it appears that pulmonary metastases have an indolent behaviour, with long-lasting stabilisation, so that in the face of this complication and the current suspicion, therapeutic rest could even be considered. If this is not the case or if progression occurs, there are non-cardiotoxic alternatives to 5-fluorouracil (raltitrexed, irinotecan). It will be up to the discretion of your regular oncologist to choose the most suitable treatment depending on the clinical situation at discharge. Electrophysiology: a 6 cm incision is made in the left mid-axillary region and dissection is carried out up to the muscular plane, the serratus anterior muscle is divided to form the pocket for the generator; tunneling is carried out from the left mid-axillary line to the left parasternal region where a 3 cm incision is made at the level of the sixth intercostal space (EIC) and from the latter it is tunneled to the second EIC (left parasternal). An electrode is fixed at the level of the sixth parasternal left EIC and connected to the generator, which is fixed to the muscular plane; it is closed in planes. The procedure was concluded without complications. Induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) was performed on three occasions, which cardioverted to sinus rhythm spontaneously, for which a 10 J shock was performed to measure the impedance of the circuit, which was normal (75 Ohm); at the end of the procedure the radiological position was assessed as adequate and a low probability of defibrillation failure was estimated (PRAETORIAN SCORE). Conditional zone is programmed at 220 bpm and VF zone at 250 bpm (5 therapies of 80 J). Post-discharge pacing on. Shock impedance in normal range. Smart Pass filter on. Vector chosen primary x 1.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient arrived at our centre haemodynamically stable, without chest pain or signs of heart failure, without ionic or other alterations. In the transthoracic echocardiogram, biventricular size and function were normal, with no significant alterations. It was decided to perform emergent coronary angiography, which showed the anomaly in the anterior descending artery (LAD) described, with no images suggestive of significant disease. Analytically, there was minimal elevation of myocardial damage markers in the serialisation, with a peak of 140 of ultra-sensitive troponin I. Once the initial study had been performed, three aetiologies of the arrest were considered: Coronary anomaly, although coronary angiography did not show an inter- or intra-arterial trajectory of the LAD. Acute coronary syndrome due to plaque rupture in the distal LAD, this entity being unlikely. Vasospasm secondary to treatment with 5-fluorouracil on previous plaque. With these options, it was decided to first perform a coronary CT scan, which ruled out an intra-arterial trajectory of the anterior descending artery. The study continued with cardiac MRI as a myocardial study, with no evidence of structural heart disease or ischaemic lesions. During admission, the patient remained on cardiac monitoring, with no arrhythmic events. At this point, having ruled out all other aetiologies, the first diagnostic possibility was vasospasm due to 5-fluorouracil; however, as this could not be confirmed reliably, she was presented at an interdisciplinary medical-surgical session (clinical and interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery and medical oncology), where it was considered that the implantation of an ICD device was indicated for secondary prevention, with a subcutaneous ICD being the ICD of choice, as she was a carrier of a central venous reservoir for active use.  The procedure was performed without periprocedural complications. However, in the following 12 hours on the ward, she presented two inappropriate shocks, assessed by electrophysiology and the company's technicians, and showed evidence of retrosternal air interference visualised in the first control X-ray after the procedure. After two days of monitoring, a new X-ray was taken which showed reabsorption of the subcutaneous emphysema, with no further discharges after 48 hours of observation. In view of the good evolution, the patient was discharged from hospital with follow-up in monographic cardio-oncology consultations. During the follow-up, new administrations of 5-fluouracil were prohibited and replaced by a new chemotherapy agent, and the patient progressed favourably from both the cardiological and oncological points of view. She has not presented any new discharges since discharge.  DIAGNOSIS Out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest with immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) recovered in second shock. Possible vasospasm due to fluoropyrimidines. Subcutaneous ICD implantation in secondary prevention. Inappropriate discharge due to air interference. Anterior descending with middle and distal portion with exit from right coronary sinus. Normal biventricular function. Adenocarcinoma of the colon intervened in control with 5-FU chemotherapy. Arterial hypertension. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of a 70-year-old man with ischaemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation with indication for anticoagulation.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidaemia, ex-smoker for 12 years (smoking history 20 packs/year). Drinker of two beers per day and one glass of wine per day.  Previous cardiological history: Chronic ischaemic heart disease; debut as acute myocardial infarction in 1998. Diffuse multivessel coronary artery disease. Catheterisation (4/11/2008): atheromatous and calcified anterior descending artery in proximal and middle segments, diseased vessel not approachable. Circumflex artery with diffuse disease of the whole vessel with poor distal beds. Atheromatous right coronary artery with irregularities. Preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Other medical history: Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No surgical interventions. Current treatment: acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24 hours, nitroglycerin patch 15 mg/24 hours, carvedilol 25 mg/12 hours, ivabradine 5 mg/12 hours, candesartan 4 mg/24 hours, rosuvastatin 20 mg/24 hours, ezetimibe 10 mg/24 hours, inhaled tiotropium and budesonide.  Present illness 70-year-old man with episodes of exertional angina for the past year. When climbing hills or accelerating his pace, he experienced oppressive discomfort in the left hemithorax that sometimes radiated to the inner arm, which self-limited within 5-10 minutes after stopping the activity. It is also associated with chest pain during sexual intercourse. No episodes at rest.   Physical examination Good general condition. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Normal colour. Blood pressure (BP) 130/71 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 75 bpm. No semiology of heart failure. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: arrhythmic heart, no murmurs. Bladder murmur preserved with no added pathological noises. Lower limbs: no oedema or fovea. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation at 90 bpm. Narrow QRS, normal axis. No repolarisation alterations. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. Free costophrenic sinuses. No images of pulmonary condensation. Laboratory tests: creatinine 0.8 mg/dl. Haemoglobin 15.4 g/dl. Ultrasensitive troponin T 17 ng/l (normal < 14 ng/l). Echocardiogram: normal aortic root, trivalve aortic valve with preserved opening and closing. Left atrium not dilated. Normal mitral valve. Left ventricle of normal size, with normal myocardial thickness. Normal global and segmental systolic function. Ventricular filling with monophasic pattern. Normal right chambers. Absence of pericardial effusion. Inferior vena cava not dilated. Prognostic ergometry, treadmill, Bruce protocol, under beta-blocker treatment: clinically negative. Electrically positive with ST-segment elevation at the end of stage 2, due to ST-segment elevation in V3-V6 of 1 mm, with an accentuated decrease in recovery up to 3 mm. Slow recovery, persisting after 6 minutes with a 2-mm decline in V3 (V2-V6 decline). Exercise time 6:06 minutes, limited by leg fatigue. Functional capacity: 7.2 METS. Normal blood pressure response. HR response attenuated by beta-blockers. Normal HR recovery. Reached 86% of maximum heart rate. All tracing in atrial fibrillation. Immediate post-stress echocardiogram: physiological hypercontractility with apical akinesia. Diagnostic and therapeutic coronary angiography: right radial access. Left dominance. Left common trunk practically non-existent giving rise to 2 independent ostia of the anterior descending artery (ADA) and circumflex artery (ACx). ADA very calcified, of small calibre with diffuse atheromatosis along its entire length, causing areas of significant stenosis at mid-distal level over a small calibre, thin and diseased vessel. Dominant circumflex artery, of large calibre and course. It presents significant eccentric stenosis proximally and medially. It emits a first marginal branch of little entity and a second branch of large calibre and route where there is a short and significant stenosis in its proximal segment. Hypodeveloped right coronary artery with diffuse atheromatosis. Percutaneous coronary intervention: on marginal branch of the LMCA by means of simple angioplasty with conventional balloon (2 mm). On CAx by implanting two drug-eluting stents after dilatation with conventional balloon at mid-distal (Resolute Onyx 3 x 30 mm, post-dilated at high pressure with a 3.5 mm non-compliant balloon) and proximal (Resolute Onyx 3.5 x 22 mm at 16 atmospheres) levels. Good final angiographic result.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was evaluated in the chest pain unit where an ergometry was performed with electrical positivity with segmental alterations in immediate post-strengthening echocardiography, so it was decided to admit the patient to hospital for coronary angiography. In addition, an electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation of uncertain chronology with controlled ventricular response. After coronary angiography revealed approachable coronary lesions, given that the patient had angina despite optimal antianginal treatment and inducible ischaemia in the non-invasive ischaemia detection test, percutaneous intervention was performed on the marginal branch and on the proximal and middle circumflex artery in order to improve the patient's symptoms. On discharge, the patient required anticoagulation (atrial fibrillation with CHA2DS2-VASc 3 points) and antiplatelet therapy (coronary revascularisation), so taking into account that the bleeding risk is high (HAS-BLED 4 points) and exceeds the ischaemic risk, a PIONEER strategy was decided and the patient was discharged with clopidogrel 75 mg/24 hours and rivaroxaban 15 mg/24 hours (including acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24 hours for the first week). Clopidogrel, if there are no incidents, will be withdrawn after 6 months, to continue with rivaroxaban at a dose of 20 mg per day if the renal glomerular filtration rate remains above 50 ml/min.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease with multivessel coronary artery disease and exertional angina despite medical treatment. Preserved LV systolic function. Percutaneous revascularisation of circumflex artery and marginal branch. Atrial fibrillation of uncertain chronology (CHA2DS2-VASc 3 points; HAS-BLED 4 points). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 51-year-old male admitted for out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest.  History Allergic to rifampicin. Hypertension of short evolution. No toxic habits. No previous cardiological history, no family history of heart disease or sudden death. No other history of interest. Usual treatment: losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 mg 1 tablet per day.  Present illness Previously asymptomatic, on the day of admission he presented, while at work, a syncopal episode without previous symptoms, witnessed by a relative. No pulse was noted and basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were started for 15 minutes. On arrival of the emergency services, orotracheal intubation was performed and advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres continued for 20 minutes. AED recording showed ventricular fibrillation and after 5 defibrillation attempts and administration of 5 mg of adrenaline, 3 mg of atropine and 300 mg of amiodarone intravenously, the patient recovered a pulse, recording sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V5, DI and aVL. During transfer to the hospital, he suffered a new episode of cardiorespiratory arrest with pulseless ventricular tachycardia, this time recovering a pulse after a single electrical cardioversion.  On arrival at the hospital, an urgent haemodynamic study was performed, which revealed epicardial coronary arteries without angiographically significant stenosis. In view of the results of the catheterisation, it was decided to perform a cranial CT scan without contrast and a chest CT scan with contrast to assess the pulmonary arteries and rule out other causes of cardiorespiratory arrest, ruling out intracranial haemorrhage, pulmonary thromboembolism and acute aortic syndrome.  Physical examination Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 134 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 98 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 81 bpm. Afebrile. Intubated and connected to mechanical ventilation, SatO2 100% with FiO2 80%. No jugular ingurgitation. Negative hepatojugular reflux. Glasgow 8, under the effect of midazolam and cisatracurium used in the induction prior to orotracheal intubation. Rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Scattered rhonchi in both lung fields. Abdomen soft and depressible, not distended. Lower extremities without oedema, with femoral, popliteal, tibial and pedial pulses bilaterally present and symmetrical. Radial pulses preserved.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Semiautomatic defibrillator (AED) recording: ventricular fibrillation. After electrical cardioversion, sinus rhythm at 75 bpm, QRS of 120 ms with intraventricular conduction disturbance, ST segment elevation from V1 to V5, DI and aVL, with specular decrease in inferior face. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission to the coronary unit: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, narrow QRS with normal axis, no ST alterations, flattened T wave in limb leads. Venous blood gases (on arrival at our centre): pH 7.11, pCO2 67.9 mmHg, pO2 56.9 mmHg, HCO3 16.7 mmol/l, Sat O2 78%, lactic acid 5.4 mmol/l, pO2(a,T)/FIO2 56.9 mmHg. Biochemistry (admission): glucose 223 mg/dl, urea 49 mg/dl, creatinine 1.04 mg/dl, CKDEPI estimate 83 ml/min/1.73 m2, sodium 138 mmol/l, potassium 4.4 mEq/l, chlorine 106 mEq/l, calcium 8,2 mg/dl, magnesium 1.8 mg/dl, CK 359 IU/l, CKMB 50 U/l, ultrasensitive troponin 996.1 ng/l (normal < 15 ng/l), procalcitonin 6.45 ng/ml, C-reactive protein 8.3 mg/l. Haemogram (admission): leucocytes 23,300 /μl, 84% neutrophils, haemoglobin 17 g/dl, haematocrit 50%, platelets 302,000 /μl. Coagulation (admission): prothrombin rate 100%, INR 1, derived fibrinogen 361 mg/dl. Haemodynamic study (admission): coronary arteries without angiographically significant stenosis. Ventriculography: left ventricle with normal function, with LVEF 53% (TVD 144 ml and STV 67ml). Aortography: trivalve aorta without insufficiency or significant transvalvular gradient. Ascending aorta not dilated. No images suggestive of aortic dissection. Chest CT with contrast (admission): no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism. Pulmonary artery trunk and thoracic aorta of normal size. No pericardial or pleural effusion. Right hilar adenopathy of 1.5 cm, non-specific. Small ipsilateral ipsilateral lateroaortic and interlobar prevascular calcified adenopathies, probably residual. Lung apexes artefacted by respiratory movements. Endotracheal tube about 3 cm from the carina. The posterior segment of the LSD, part of the apical segment and posterobasal segments of the LID, as well as the apical and posterobasal segments of the LII are consolidated with air bronchogram (suggesting atelectasis), probably secondary to accumulation of secretions, decubitus or bronchoaspiration. Linear subpleural calcification in the posterior subsegment of the LSI of cicatricial or residual appearance. Secretions in proximal trachea. Marked dilatation of gastric chamber with hydro-aerial level in relation to previous CPR manoeuvres. CT scan of the brain without contrast (admission): no significant alterations.

Morphologically normal valves, with trivial mitral insufficiency. No alterations of note. Chest X-ray (admission): normal cardiothoracic index, lung parenchyma and bronchovascular tract without alterations. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring (second day of admission): sinus rhythm without repolarisation alterations. Progressive ST-segment elevation was observed in the only lead recorded, subsequently presenting sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that degenerated into ventricular fibrillation with normalisation of repolarisation alterations after administration of intravenous nitroglycerine. MRI (12th day of admission): no global or segmental alterations in myocardial contractility. Late enhancement sequences without alterations. Normal first-pass myocardial perfusion study. Cardiac cavity diameters: VITD 50 mm, VITS 34 mm, LA 23 cm2, VDTD 40 mm, VDTS 31 mm, AD 22 cm2. Left ventricular function preserved, with LVEF 62%, with values indexed by body surface area (m2): VTD 125 ml, VTS 47 ml, stroke volume 78 ml. Flow artefacts compatible with mitral insufficiency (MI) and tricuspid insufficiency (TI), not significant. Conclusion: study within normal limits.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was transferred to the emergency department of our centre due to out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest. Given that he presented electrocardiographic alterations suggestive of acute coronary syndrome, urgent coronary angiography was performed showing coronary arteries without lesions, cranial CT and thoracic CT angiography, which ruled out acute pathology justifying the arrest. The patient was admitted to the cardiac critical care unit and therapeutic hypothermia was started. Echocardioscopy was performed, showing a left ventricle with preserved ventricular function and no abnormalities of contractility, with no significant alterations. On the second day of admission he presented a sudden rise in the ST segment recorded in the single lead of the continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, with a subsequent bout of sustained ventricular tachycardia that degenerated into ventricular fibrillation without haemodynamic compromise, which resolved after treatment with intravenous nitroglycerine. Given clinical suspicion of vasospasm, an urgent blood test and arterial blood gas analysis were performed, ruling out hydroelectrolyte alterations; even so, hypothermia therapy was withdrawn. During his stay in the cardiovascular critical care unit, the patient presented a febrile peak and parameters of infection of probable respiratory origin, which was resolved with antibiotic therapy with imipenem 1 g i.v. every 8 hours and linezolid 600 mg i.v. every 12 hours for 10 days. Given the good haemodynamic, neurological and respiratory evolution, the patient was extubated without incident on the eighth day of admission.  After being discharged to the hospital ward, he made good progress. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed, which was normal, ruling out structural heart disease. Prior to discharge, it was decided to implant a single-chamber automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) as secondary prevention, and he was discharged stable and asymptomatic.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 66-year-old male, hypertensive, type 2 diabetic, dyslipidaemic and ex-smoker, with no other history of interest, attended the emergency department in April 2020 for progressive dyspnoea of several days' evolution and fever, with no other associated cardiovascular symptoms. Home treatment with enalapril 5 mg/24 hours, atorvastatin 40 mg/24 hours and metformin 850 mg/24 hours. On first examination, the patient was haemodynamically stable, although his general condition was poor. Blood pressure (BP) 130/75 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 75 bpm, RR 30 rpm, basal saturation 85%, temperature 38.3 oC. Pulmonary auscultation showed bilateral crackles in both fields, with normal cardiac auscultation and no oedema in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Arterial blood gases Hypoxaemic respiratory failure. pH 7.35, pCO2 30 mmHg, pO2 62 mmHg, HCO3- 25 mmol/l, lactic 2.3. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 75 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, normal axis, diffuse repolarisation alterations (flattened T in inferior and lateral face) not suggestive of acute ischaemia. Chest X-ray: peripheral infiltrate in the left mid-inferior field and of lesser density in the peripheral region of the midfield and right paracardiac region, compatible with SARS-CoV2 infection of moderate degree from the radiological point of view. CBC: creatinine 0.96 mg/dl, no ionic alterations, liver profile with mild elevation of transaminases, first troponin T 150 ng/dl, second troponin T 200 ng/dl, CK 100U/l, LDH 450U/l, Hb 11mg/dl, platelets 160,000/ul, leukocytes 9000/ul, neutrophils 80%, lymphocytes 1000/ul, D-dimers 900 ng/ml. Nasopharyngeal PCR for SARS-CoV2: positive.  CLINICAL COURSE In view of these findings, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral SARS-CoV2 pneumonia with associated acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, so he was admitted and treatment was started with oxygen therapy for SatO2 > 90%, reducing the patient's respiratory rate, hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/12 hours for the first 24 hours and then 200 mg/12 hours v. o.), liponavir and liponavir (400 mg/12 hours for the first 24 hours and then 200 mg/12 hours v. o.).o.), liponavir-ritonavir (200/50 mg/12 hours o.v.), azithromycin 500 mg/24 hours o.v. and ceftriaxone 2 g/24 hours i.v. When markers of myocardial damage were elevated due to suspicion of associated myocarditis, the cardiology department was consulted. In the transthoracic echocardiogram, the patient showed a non-dilated, slightly hypertrophic left ventricle, with hypokinesia of the distal middle segments of the inferior septum, and normal LVEF; a non-dilated, normofunctioning right ventricle, and absence of significant valvular heart disease or pericardial effusion (video 1). We interpreted the elevated markers of myocardial damage as justifiable by the clinical context of the patient (hypoxaemia, acute infection, possible underlying heart disease) and did not perform further tests. The patient evolved favourably and was discharged 10 days after admission.  DIAGNOSIS Bilateral SARS-CoV2 pneumonia with elevated markers of myocardial damage in this context. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Alendronic acid every 28 days.   Present illness A 76-year-old man came to the emergency department with fluctuating weakness of the left limbs after a fierce argument with his son and associated nervousness. He was assessed by neurology with no other neurological deficit and a simple CT scan of the skull was performed with no early signs or acute ischaemic lesions, and angio-CT without occlusion of a large vessel. As a result, and in view of the improvement in symptoms, the patient was discharged with recommendations on alarm data. Four days later, he returned to the emergency department due to a progressive worsening of his symptoms, and a new cranial CT scan was performed which confirmed the existence of an established infarct with a new appearance of a hypodense focal area in the right lenticular and radial crown. The patient was treated with edoxaban as anticoagulation for PAF, ensuring good compliance with treatment.  Physical examination Good general condition. Haemodynamically stable, blood pressure 128/68 mmHg and heart rate 53 bpm. Afebrile. Eupneic at rest and when speaking, with total tolerance of decubitus. Normal colour and no skin lesions. Neurological examination: good level of consciousness, he was able to name, understand and repeat without language alterations. No oculocephalic deviation or campimetric deficit. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive to light and accommodation. Preserved external ocular motors. Left gestural asymmetry. Claudica without contact with bed with left limbs (requires insistence to perform antigravity manoeuvres). Hypoalgesia in left hemibody. No dysmetria, no dysarthria, no parietal cortical data. Walking with the help of two people. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: rhythmic, without murmurs and with preserved vesicular murmur without added pathological noises. Abdomen: soft, depressible, no masses or megaliths palpable and painless on palpation. Lower limbs: no oedema, no fovea and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus bradycardia at 53 beats per minute. Normal axis. PR 240 ms. QRS 80 ms. R amputated in aVL. Elevation of the J point in the inferolateral face. CBC: glucose 105 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.84 mg/dl. Sodium 140 mEq/l. Potassium 4 mEq/l. Leukocytes 7900 (68% polymorphonuclear). Haemoglobin 12 g/dl. Platelets 183,000. INR 1.21. Troponin T ultrasensitive 15 ng/l. Creatine kinase 59 U/l. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. Prominent aortic button. Thickened hilae, with increased bronchovascular raster and redistribution to the vertex. Cranial CT scan: hypodense focal area in the right lenticular and radial crown, compatible with established focal infarction. No other relevant findings. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography: the left atrium (LA) is not dilated (36 mm). The mitral valve has normal leaflets, without insufficiency. The left ventricle (LV) is of normal dimensions (end-diastolic diameter 44 mm). Ejection fraction by Simpson biplane 60% without regional contractility alterations. Septum 10 mm. Posterior wall 8 mm. Mitral E 79 cm/s, A: 64 cm/s. Trivalve aortic valve with good opening and closing. Sinuses of Valsalva: 37 mm, ascending tubular aorta: 32 mm. Right ventricle of normal size and contractility. Normal tricuspid valve without insufficiency. Mild pulmonary insufficiency with mean pulmonary artery pressure 14 mmHg. Normal inferior vena cava. No pericardial effusion. Large mobile mass in LA with wide insertion pedicle of 21 mm, in the posterior wall of the atrial roof. In this area of the atrial wall there is a minimal pericardial fluid sheet of 1.5 mm. The mass is 6.1 cm long (maximum width 2 cm), highly mobile, polylobulated-branched, with an irregular surface and several long, mobile outgrowths. The length of the mass causes it to prolapse in diastole through the mitral orifice into the base of the LV without causing mitral obstruction. The echogenicity of the mass is hypoechoic in the area of implantation, with the rest being of higher echogenicity, with some rounded hypoechoic area in the body. Mitral valve with normal leaflets, without insufficiency. Left atrial appendage without thrombus. Normal aortic valve and proximal aorta. Descending thoracic aorta with some uncomplicated atheroma plaque. Conclusions: large mass (6.1 x 2 cm) mobile in left atrium, inserted with wide pedicle (2.1 cm) in atrial roof-posterior wall. Thoracoabdominal CT scan: LA of normal dimensions. Hypodense mass of irregular contours and with excrescences that seems to be fixed in the angle formed by the posterior wall of the LA with the inferoposterior slope of the interatrial septum (below the mouth of the right inferior pulmonary vein without affecting its drainage). Its approximate dimensions are 47 x 21 mm in the apical 4C (Ap x T) plane and a CC axis of 29 mm in the EL plane. Apart from the described anchorage, its growth is fundamentally intracavitary, with no invasiveness of adjacent cardiovascular structures. Slight overlapping of the mitral valve plane towards the LV. LV and right chambers of normal dimensions. High coronary calcium load in the proximal course of the coronary arteries. Thoracic aorta of normal calibre, slightly elongated and with calcium-predominant atheromatosis in the arch and origin of supra-aortic trunks. Pulmonary trunk of normal dimensions, as well as the branches, without repletion defects. No adenomegaly or suspicious lymph nodes. Signs of smoking can be seen in the lung parenchyma. Biapical fibrocystic tracts. No pulmonary consolidations or nodules are identified. Liver of adequate size and attenuation, without identifying LOEs. No significant findings in the gallbladder, bile duct, splenoportal axis, spleen, adrenal or pancreas. Kidneys of normal size and differentiation with several post-pelonephritic cortical scars and parapelvic and cortical cysts. No dilatation of their excretory systems. Moderately replete urinary bladder with no areas of mural thickening. Moderate prostatic hypertrophy. Stomach almost empty, not very appreciable. Small bowel loops and right colon with mural thickness caliber disruption. Moderate aortoiliac atheromatosis. No inguinal adenomegaly of suspicious appearance. Osteoporosis. Central wedging of L2 in this context AND more mildly in some dorsal bodies. Fracture of the left femur treated with nail and screw consolidated. Conclusion: irregular hypodense mass anchored in the angle between the lower wall of the LA and the posteroinferior aspect of the interatrial septum. No signs of current metastatic spread. Coronary angiography: right radial access. Coronary arteries with previously implanted stents in anterior descending artery and circumflex artery without restenosis and without other significant lesions. Right dominance. Pathological anatomy: multiple tissue fragments of gelatinous consistency, the largest of which was 2x1 cm, one of which was found adhered to the muscle wall. Conclusion: myxoma with respect of the implantation base.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On admission to the neurology ward, and in view of the suspected embolic origin of the stroke, a regular echocardiography was requested, where the culprit of the event was discovered. Initially, a transthoracic study was performed, where a normal heart was visualised, finding a large mobile mass (6.1 x 2 cm) attached to the posterior wall of the left atrium, so for a better characterisation the study was completed with transesophageal echocardiography. Despite the high suspicion of myxoma, the characteristics of the mass (wide insertion not in the interatrial septum, polylobulated-branched and with hypoechoic areas inside) do not clearly indicate this aetiology, but rather extend the differential diagnosis to other entities with a worse prognosis... such as sarcoma. A CT scan of the thorax and abdomen was performed, which provided some reassurance as no signs of metastatic dissemination were observed. After diagnosis, the patient was transferred to the cardiology ward, where the pre-surgical study was completed (coronary angiography with stability of coronary disease). After a week of hospitalisation, without complications and with greater safety from the point of view of intracranial haemorrhagic risk, surgery was performed, in which wedge resection of the floor of the left atrium was performed with the implantation base of the tumour, which the surgeons described as a brownish, gelatinous and very friable tumour. Subsequent evolution in the intensive care unit and on the cardiology ward was very favourable and without complications. The patient was discharged 7 days after the operation, and in agreement with neurology, anticoagulation was restarted with edoxaban 60 mg every 24 hours. After the anatomopathological study of the surgical specimen, it was possible to name the tumour, confirming the initial suspicion of myxoma that the echocardiography had provided. The patient is currently undergoing motor rehabilitation due to the sequelae of left lower limb hemiparesis, and from the cardiological point of view he is asymptomatic and without any complications.  DIAGNOSIS Ischaemic stroke in the right choroidal artery of embolic origin. Pedunculated atrial myxoma implanted in the roof of the left atrium. Surgical excision of left atrial myxoma without complications. Normal left ventricular function. Stable chronic coronary syndrome with two-vessel disease (Cx and LAD) with complete percutaneous revascularisation. Residual left lower limb hemiparesis as a sequel to the ischemic stroke. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Normal pericardium, no pericardial effusion. 12-lead ECG performed on the cardiology ward after cardiorespiratory arrest: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Narrow QRS. Deep negative T waves V2-V6. Negative T waves of lesser magnitude in inferior face, I and aVL. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): no evidence of space-occupying lesion, haemorrhage or recent acute or subacute infarction. CT scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast: thickening of the duodenal papilla. Adenopathies of non-specific appearance in the lesser sac, mesentery and retroperitoneum. Bilateral pleural effusion with passive collapse of posterior basal subsegments. Nonspecific micro-nodule in the right lower lobe.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION After being assessed in the emergency department with normal complementary tests, he was admitted to the cardiology ward to complete the study. A few hours after admission, he began to experience chest pain and the ECG showed ST elevation in the lower lobe. Urgent coronary angiography showed severe spasm of the left main coronary artery, right coronary artery and circumflex artery, with fine calibre of the entire coronary tree, which resolved with intracoronary nitroglycerine. After administration of intravenous nitroglycerine, no angiographically significant lesions were detected. Subsequently, he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where myocardial damage markers were normal and, after remaining stable for 48 hours, he was returned to the cardiology ward. Once on the ward, treatment was started with calcium antagonists (ACA) and nitrates, which were titrated to the maximum tolerated doses. Despite this, he presented with a new episode of precordial pain followed by cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) in electromechanical dissociation. After advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres for 10 minutes with the need for orotracheal intubation, he recovered a pulse in sinus tachycardia for 1 minute and subsequently presented with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia requiring urgent electrical cardioversion. He was transferred to the ICU where he again registered polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, requiring a new electrical cardioversion, with exit in sinus rhythm. After CRP, myocardial damage markers were serum tested and an enzyme curve was found compatible with acute myocardial infarction and electrocardiographic changes compatible with subendocardial ischaemia. A new urgent echocardiogram was performed with no changes with respect to the previous one. In the control analysis that had been drawn just before the CRA, renal function and ions, including potassium and magnesium, were normal. Subsequently, he required prolonged admission to the ICU due to haemodynamic instability requiring treatment with vasoactive amines. After achieving haemodynamic stability, he returned to the cardiology ward, where treatment was optimised with the addition of fluvastatin and high doses of calcium antagonists and nitrates, which were poorly tolerated due to hypotension. Despite this, the patient presented recurrent vasospasm crises (with electrocardiographic confirmation). In view of the severe vasospasm refractory to treatment, an extensive study was carried out to detect underlying pathologies that could be associated with or justify the recurrent vasospasm (metabolic, tumour, autoimmune, etc.). As the only findings during admission, the endocrinology department diagnosed partial adrenal insufficiency of pituitary origin due to moderate hypoosmolar hyponatraemia with clinical repercussions (drowsiness), which was corrected with hydrocortisone. In addition, a monoclonal IgM Kappa band was detected in the proteinogram. Finally, after ruling out a correctable cause associated with the recurrent vasospasm crises and given the lack of response and poor tolerance of nitrates, it was decided to withdraw the latter and empirically add cilostazol (phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor) to the ACAs. After starting this treatment, the patient remained asymptomatic, with no new episodes of chest pain or vasospasm. After ruling out other possible causes of CRA, it was determined that there was a high possibility that CRA occurred in the context of prolonged vasospasm. Therefore, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention. Once the ICD was implanted and the vasospasm crises were controlled, we progressively reduced cilostazol until complete withdrawal of the drug, after which the patient was asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable. At discharge, treatment with ACA and fluvastatin was maintained with excellent response, with no new events occurring in the first year of follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Recurrent vasospastic angina refractory to treatment. In-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest related to acute myocardial infarction secondary to vasospastic angina. Implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD VR) in secondary prevention. Partial adrenal insufficiency of pituitary origin. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cardiological history: chest pain with coronary angiography in 2017 with moderate lesions in the middle segment of the anterior descending artery and in the middle segment of the right coronary artery labelled with stable angina (chronic coronary syndrome), with echocardiogram with normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Other history: chronic kidney disease not studied with baseline creatinine around 1.3 mg/dl, gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection not eradicated, hiatal hernia, Schatzki's ring and diverticulosis. Previous treatments: chlorthalidone 50 mg 1-0-0-0; losartan 100 mg 1-0-0-0-0, pitavastatin 1 mg 0-0-1-0: ranitidine 150 mg 0-0-1-0; clopidogrel 75 mg 1-0-0-0-0; isosorbide mononitrate 50 mg 1-0-0-0-0.  Present illness He was brought in by ambulance due to a condition that started at 5 a.m. and woke him up, consisting of central thoracic pain of intensity 10/10, oppressive, radiating to the jaw and back, accompanied by nausea without vomiting. At home he took paracetamol with partial relief of the pain, which subsided after 3 hours. He reports that the previous day he had been doing strenuous physical exertion at home (sanding parquet). He denied fever or other clinical symptoms in the previous days. The emergency team (SUMMA) initially administered 275 mg of acetylsalicylic acid, performed an electrocardiogram with no notable alterations and transferred him to the hospital emergency department.  Physical examination On arrival at the hospital, blood pressure of 156/68 mmHg, heart rate of 55 bpm, ambient air saturation of 98% and temperature of 35.3oC were observed. He was also found to be in good general condition, conscious and oriented, eupneic at rest and well perfused. No IY. Cardiopulmonary auscultation without alterations. Abdomen soft and not painful. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: Biochemistry: glucose 133.6 mg/dl, creatinine 1.69 (previous 1.3) mg/dl, sodium 136.6 mEq/l, potassium 4.53 mEq/l, chlorine 94.5 mEq/l, total protein 7.31 g/dl, albumin 4.2 g/dl, ALT (GPT) 18.1 U/l, AST (GOT) haemolysis, gamma-GT 11 U/l alkaline phosphatase 56 U/l, LDH haemolysis, bilirubin .6 mg/dl, C-reactive protein .79 mg/dl, CK 188 U/l (second determination 309), troponin T hs 44.75 ng/l (second profile 599.2). Haematology: leukocytes 8.3 x1000/μl, red cells 4.59 xmill/μl, haemoglobin 14.6 g/dl, haematocrit 43%, MCV 93.5 fl, MCH 31.9 pg, MCHC 34.1 g/dl, RDW 13.3%, platelets 80 x1000/μl, MPV 10.1 fl, neutrophils 7 x1000/μl, neutrophils %: 84.6, lymphocytes .8 x1000/μl, lymphocytes % 9.2, monocytes .4 x1000/μl, monocytes % 5.3, eosinophils 0 x1000/μl, eosinophils % .6, basophils: 0 x1000/μl, basophils % .3. Haemostasis: prothrombin activity 92%, prothrombin time 12.2 sec, INR (lab) 1.06, TTPa 34 sec, fibrinogen (derivative) 594 mg/dl, D-dimer 257 ng/ml. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 75 bpm, PR in range, normal axis, narrow QRS, QTc not prolonged, without acute repolarisation alterations, with flattened T wave in high lateral face and left precordial. Similar to previous ones. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index (CTI) with no signs of pulmonary congestion or other alterations. Echocardioscopy: left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic. Subjective systolic function preserved, dyskinesia of the middle segment of the anteroseptal face, without other alterations of segmental contractility. Mitral insufficiency, which appears mild-moderate by colour Doppler. Transthoracic echocardiogram (video 1): non-dilated left ventricle, with a slight increase in wall thickness. Localised akinesia at the level of the middle interventricular septum, both anterior and inferior, with the rest of the segments normocontractile. Preserved systolic function (LVEF 70% by Simpson biplane). Normal diastolic function. Non-dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function. No other findings. Cardiac catheterisation: common trunk without lesions. Dominant circumflex, of good calibre and great development, without significant lesions. Anterior descending artery with moderate plaque of stable appearance in the middle segment, with good distal vessel, without other significant lesions. Non-dominant right coronary artery, with a slight plaque in the proximal segment, with no other lesions, being a poorly developed vessel. Cardiac MRI: ventricles neither dilated nor hypertrophic. In the sequences for assessment of myocardial oedema (T2-STIR), a pathological increase in signal intensity was observed in the middle segment of the anterior septum, suggestive of oedema. In the late enhancement sequences there are patchy areas of intramyocardial enhancement in the middle segment of the anterior and posterior septum, basal segment of the anterior septum, insertion of the RV free wall, and small foci of intramyocardial enhancement in the basal and middle segment of the lateral face and basal segment of the posterior face. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2: negative.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the clinical picture in the ED of chest pain with initial tests with no particularly noteworthy findings except for a slightly increased first troponin (in a patient with acute chronic kidney disease), it was decided to perform enzyme serology, with a second determination substantially higher than the previous one, so that the ED notified cardiology. Urgent echocardioscopy revealed a dyskinetic segment at septal level, which together with the elevation of markers of myocardial damage led to the initial diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction without ST elevation, so previous treatment with clopidogrel was maintained and fondaparinux, acetylsalicylic acid and atorvastatin were added. Urgent coronary angiography was performed in the first 24 hours, which revealed no significant coronary lesions, so the patient was classified as a myocardial infarction without obstructive coronary lesions (MINOCA) and was transferred to the cardiology hospital ward, monitored for further study. Once there, a regulated transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, confirming the previous findings, and a cardiac magnetic resonance was performed, showing findings compatible with acute myocarditis, with peak troponin of 678.9 ng/l. Paracetamol was prescribed as symptomatic treatment and the patient was discharged home after several days of stability, with no recurrence of the symptoms or appearance of significant events on telemetry. In addition, due to the presence of coronary artery disease and LDL of 171 mg/dl, it was decided to change from pitavastatin to rosuvastatin-ezetimibe (the patient reported previous intolerance to atorvastatin) with a target LDL cholesterol < 55 mg/dl, and an appointment for a review at the next consultation.  DIAGNOSIS Acute non-COVID myocarditis. Normal left ventricular function. Acute chronic kidney disease on admission of probable pre-renal origin. Chronic coronary syndrome with non-significant two-vessel coronary artery disease. Hypercholesterolemia with LDL out of target (very high cardiovascular risk patient). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Dilated inferior vena cava 24 mm without inspiratory collapse. Severe pericardial effusion of global distribution with significant haemodynamic compromise of the right cavities.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On evaluation by the cardiologist on duty, the patient was in obstructive shock secondary to cardiac tamponade as seen by transthoracic echocardiography. It was decided to cautiously administer intravascular volume, to associate treatment with norepinephrine and to immediately transfer him to the coronary care unit. Once in the coronary care unit, it was decided to check the patient's haemogram and haemostasis in order to perform diagnostic/therapeutic pericardiocentesis, with unacceptable figures for this procedure without haemorrhagic risk. Given the persistence of obstructive shock in the context of cardiac tamponade despite the prescribed intravenous treatment, it was decided to request and administer 2 ampoules of idarucizumab as an antidote for the patient's anticoagulation. The improvement of haemostatic parameters was verified in control analyses, which allowed the procedure to be carried out one hour after administration. Diagnostic/therapeutic pericardiocentesis guided by echocardiography was performed and 650 cc of serohematic fluid was extracted with evident haemodynamic improvement. Samples of pericardial fluid were sent for study. In the following days the patient showed a favourable evolution with haemodynamic stability without vasoactive/inothropic support and negative balances and progressive improvement of clinical and radiological signs of congestion. A control echocardiogram was performed showing minimal residual pericardial effusion with no evidence of haemodynamic compromise, so the drain was removed without complications after 24 hours, dabigatran was reintroduced and medical discharge was decided.  DIAGNOSIS Obstructive shock in the context of cardiac tamponade. Severe pericardial effusion complicated by cardiac tamponade.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 68-year-old woman was referred to the outpatient cardiology department for a cardiac mass found on computed axial tomography (CT).  History No known cardiovascular risk factors. Independent for basic activities of daily living. Left renal neoplasm (clear cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid differentiation 80%, PT3A) with left nephrectomy in 2013 and reoperation for secondary eventration in 2017. Normofunctioning multinodular goitre, in evolutionary follow-up. No other history of interest and without usual pharmacological treatment.  Current disease Previously asymptomatic cardiovascular patient, she presented with pain in the left hemithorax (VAS 4), with pleuritic characteristics, not triggered by exertion, of prolonged duration and appearing sporadically at rest. In the CT scan of renal neoplasia, a left ventricle-dependent mass was detected, with progressive growth, and the patient was referred to cardiology.  Physical examination Blood pressure 120/80 mmHg. Heart rate 70 bpm. Eupneic at rest. Jugular venous pressure normal. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic, with protomesosystolic murmur II/VI in aortic focus with preserved second sound, pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur, without added pathological noises. Abdominal examination with no significant findings. No oedema in the lower extremities, with preserved and symmetrical peripheral pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 85 bpm, PR 160ms, QRS 100ms, cardiac axis -15o with HBAI, non-pathological septal Q wave, isolated negative T in V1 without other alterations. Analysis: leukocytes 6,600/μl, haemoglobin 14.2 g/dl, platelets 190,000/μl, glucose 93 mg/dl, urea 53 mg/dl, creatinine 0.91 mg/dl, MDRD-IDMS: > 60 ml/min, AST 16 IU/l, ALT 14IU/l, GGT 16IU/l, Na 141 mmol/l, K 4.4 mmol/l. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. No mediastinal widening. No evidence of heart failure. Echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal size with preserved ejection fraction, without segmental contractility abnormalities. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Grade I diastolic dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Large mass of irregular echogenicity, paracardiac, in the posterior and lateral area of the left ventricle, which does not compromise ventricular function. Thoracic-abdominal CT with contrast: solid mass with heterogeneous attenuation and estimated maximum diameters of 6.3 x 5.5 x 3.8 cm (craniocaudal, AP and transverse axes respectively), dependent on the lateral and basal wall of the left ventricle, which imprints and slightly deforms the lateral wall of the left atrium. An asymmetric thickening of the left ventricular wall is observed coinciding with the location of the current lesion. Cardiac MRI: large mass in the lateral area of the left ventricle and atrioventricular groove (6.4 x 5.2 cm maximum diameter), affecting the full thickness of the wall and with a mass effect on the lateral aspect of the left atrium. Well-defined outline, with myocardial and pericardial infiltration. The signal is isointense on T1 enhancement, faintly hyperintense on T2 and markedly hyperintense on STIR, with evidence of intense vascularisation on first-pass images after intravenous gadolinium administration. Heterogeneous late enhancement, predominantly central, in the form of a ring surrounding the necrotic area. Pathology: the endomyocardial fragments show areas of infiltration by a tumour with a growth pattern in solid nests or irregular cords, with dense inflammatory response, and consisting of cells with rounded or lobulated nuclei with moderate anisokaryosis, and clato- or acidophilic cytoplasm. Focally the tumour adopts a rhabdoid pattern and morphology. Immunohistochemistry shows expression of CK AE1-AE3, vimentin and CD10 in neoplastic cells. Diagnosis: endomyocardial fragments with metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (sarcomatoid histopathological pattern, similar to that described in the patient's previous biopsy).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION It was decided to extend the study with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better identify the cardiac mass, with the results described above. Given the findings of the MRI and the patient's clinical history, metastatic implantation was suspected as the first option, and an endomyocardial biopsy was performed, which was found to be compatible with metastasis of renal cell carcinoma. Subsequently, the patient was referred to the oncology outpatient department, which started treatment with sunitinib 50 mg every 24 hours, 2/1 schedule, presenting growth of the cardiac mass and increased pericardial effusion after 5 months of treatment, so it was decided to start immunotherapy with nivolumab, achieving a complete tumour response, with regression of the cardiac tumour mass, with no evidence of progression at present.  DIAGNOSIS Paracardiac mass with pericardial and intramural infiltration, compatible with metastasis of renal carcinoma. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Brother with previous recurrent myocarditis in 2000, with clinical diagnosis and no subsequent follow-up. No history of sudden death or other heart disease in first-degree relatives. No known drug allergies. No toxic habits. She had no cardiovascular risk factors or medical or surgical history of interest.  Present illness A 36-year-old man consulted for non-radiating, oppressive, central thoracic pain that started at rest and woke him from sleep. The pain was accompanied by nausea, sweating and a sensation of dyspnoea and improved slightly when he got into bed. The patient mentioned the presence of fever and pharyngeal pain 2 days before the onset of the symptoms. On arrival at the hospital, electrocardiographic alterations and elevated markers of myocardial damage in the infarct range were observed, so an urgent coronary angiography was performed in which no coronary lesions were found.  Physical examination Good general condition, conscious and oriented in all 3 spheres. Haemodynamically stable. Eupneic at rest. Normal colour, well hydrated and perfused. Afebrile. Blood pressure (BP) 151/84 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 72 bpm, SatO2 99% without contributions. No signs of heart failure. Cardiorespiratory auscultation: rhythmic at a good frequency, no murmurs or extratonos. Vesicular murmur preserved, no pathological noises added. Abdomen: soft and depressible, not painful on palpation. No signs of defence or peritoneal irritation. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on admission to the ward: sinus rhythm at 64 bpm. Normal PR. QTc 441 msec. J point elevation of < 1 mm from V4 to V6. Negative T wave from V4 to V6. Emergency laboratory tests: CBC: leukocytes 10420 (1360 lymphocytes), Hb 15.7 g/dl, platelets 182000. Biochemistry: glucose 142 mg/dl, AST 42 U/l, renal function and ions normal, CRP 195.4 mg/l. Enzyme serum: creatine kinase 270 - 641 - 723 U/l, ultrasensitive troponin T 500 - 1061 - 1744 - 1184 - 1225 ng/dl. Chest X-ray: normal. Cardiothoracic index normal. No signs of pulmonary congestion, condensation or effusion. Coronary angiography: angiographically normal coronary arteries. Anomalous outflow of the right coronary artery from the left sinus, without angiographically significant lesions. Serology: negative for HIV, syphilis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Positive for past infection by adenovirus, CMV, Echovirus, EBV, parvovirus B19 and Coxsackie. Laboratory tests: Biochemistry: glucose 87 mg/dl, renal function and ions normal, LDH 388.00 U/l, hepatobiliary profile without alterations. Total protein 7.7 g/dl. NT-proBNP 379 pg/ml. C-reactive protein 65.0 mg/l. Lipid profile: cholesterol 210 mg/dl, LDL 153 mg/dl, HDL 26 mg/dl, triglycerides 156.00 mg/dl. Thyroid hormones and HbA1c normal. CBC: three normal series. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic, with preserved global and segmental mobility. Ejection fraction (EF) measured with the Simpson method: 68.8%. LVEDV of 140 ml, indexed by body surface area of 67 ml/m2, LVESV of 44 ml, indexed by body surface area of 21 ml/m2. Myocardial mass 119 g, indexed by body surface area of 57 g/m.Right ventricle not dilated or hypertrophic, with preserved global and segmental mobility; EF measured by Simpson's method of 81% VTDVD of 110 ml, indexed by body surface area of 53 ml/m. VTSVD of 21 ml, indexed by body surface area 22 of 10 ml/m. Both atria of normal size (left atrium with an area of 22 cm, indexed to 11 cm/m and right atrium of 19 cm, indexed to 9 cm/m). In the sequence STIR shows hyperintense signal compatible with oedema in the inferior and anterior basal and medial segments, medial lateral and in all apical segments. The first-pass perfusion sequence shows no basal perfusion defects. In the late enhancement/viability sequence, there was extensive subepicardial and intramyocardial fibrosis in the basal and middle inferior and middle anterior and inferolateral segments and in all apical segments. Conclusion: acute myocarditis with extensive fibrosis and preserved biventricular function.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After a favourable evolution during admission, our patient was discharged, with initiation of 5 mg of enalapril per day. After 4 months during which he was asymptomatic, he was admitted again for symptoms compatible with acute myopericarditis (ultrasensitive troponin T peak of 2174 ng/dl), with gastroenteritis of probable viral origin as a possible trigger. A new transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing slight global hypokinesia with an EF of 50%. After a satisfactory evolution, the patient was discharged, and colchicine was prescribed as a preventive treatment for new recurrences. A new cardiac MRI was performed on an outpatient basis, in the first 2 weeks after discharge, which showed the persistence of extensive fibrosis of similar distribution to the previous study, as well as denovo fibrosis at the level of the basal and medial septum (images 5 and 6). Both ventricles had normal morphology and volumes, with no detectable segmental contractility disturbances, and biventricular systolic function was preserved. In the STIR and black blood sequences, there were no intramyocardial fatty deposits and there was significant oedema at the level of the septum. In view of the results of the MRI, a 24-hour Holter monitor was requested, which showed isolated monotopic ventricular extrasystoles with morphology of right bundle branch block with transition in V3 and superior axis, and it was decided to increase the doses of ACE inhibitors (enalapril 5 mg/12 hours) and to start beta-blocker treatment (bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 hours). His brother was seen at our clinic due to a history of recurrent myocarditis, and a cardiac MRI was performed, confirming the presence of subepicardial fibrosis in the free wall of the left ventricle, compatible with past myocarditis. Finally, given the pattern of fibrosis in the MRI together with the history of a first-degree relative with recurrent myocarditis, the differential diagnosis of acute recurrent myocarditis with extensive fibrosis versus arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the left ventricle was considered and it was decided to request a genetic study with a cardiomyopathy panel, the results of which are still pending.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocarditis with extensive fibrosis and preserved biventricular function versus arrhythmogenic left ventricular dysplasia with myocarditis-e flares. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 58-year-old woman, no known drug allergies.  History Cardiovascular risk factors: active smoker (8-10 cigarettes a day). Depressive syndrome. Menopause at 50-51 years of age. No known cardiological history, neither in relatives. Usual treatment: citalopram 10 mg.  Current illness Consultation in the emergency department for chest discomfort onset at rest, with associated presyncopal symptoms lasting approximately 50 minutes. On assessment, she was asymptomatic, with an initial electrocardiogram (ECG) with no abnormalities and positive troponin determination, so the patient was diagnosed as non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) Killip I and admission to the intermediate care unit was decided.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 110/60 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 60 bpm. Oxygen saturation (basal) 96%. Afebrile. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normal. Abdomen: nondescript. Lower limbs: no oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 72 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, without acute repolarisation alterations. Laboratory tests: NT-proBNP 22 pg/ml, troponin I US 1,871 -> peak 5,212 pg/ml (normal value <14 pg/ml). Renal function and ions normal. Haemoglobin 14.4 g/dl, platelets 201,000/μl, leucocytes 5,600/μl. Glucose 87 mg/dl, creatinine 0.74 mg/dl, Na 139 mEq/l, K 4.9 mEq/l, TSH normal, total cholesterol 259 mg/dl, HDL 58 mg/dl, LDL 183 mg/dl. Chest X-ray: cardiac silhouette, parenchyma and pulmonary vascularisation without pathological findings. Cardiac catheterisation: epicardial coronary arteries without angiographic lesions in main vessels. Only a third obtuse marginal branch showed a sudden change in calibre from 1.5 mm to less than 1 mm, which subsequently recovered the size of the vessel, which could correspond to an area of haematoma/spontaneous dissection. Ventriculography: left ventricle (LV) with preserved systolic function, very localised akinesia of the mid-basal inferolateral area. Echocardiogram: non-dilated LV, normal wall thickness, preserved systolic function (LVEF 59%), no segmental alterations. Atria not dilated. Right ventricle (RV) not dilated with normal contractility (TAPSE 20 mm, S wave 11.5 cm/s). Slight mitral sclerosis, correct and competent opening. Trivalve aortic valve with calcium spot in non-coronary leaflet and mild sclerosis, not restricted in opening and with mild central insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency, RV-AD gradient 15 mmHg. Mild pulmonary insufficiency, protodiastolic gradient 6 mmHg. Pulmonary acceleration time 130 ms. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated (13 mm) with normal collapse. Normal PAPs. Absence of pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (CT) body: origin of the supra-aortic trunks of normal morphology. Axillary-subclavian arterial axes and carotid axes permeable and of normal calibre. Cervical segment of internal carotid artery with slight irregularity, not conclusive of dysplasia. Left vertebral dominance. Left coronary trunk and circumflex artery of normal calibre. Patent aorta with preserved calibre. Bilateral accessory renal artery with origin cranial to the ipsilateral main renal artery. Main renal arteries of arrosariado-displastic appearance. Patent and ectatic iliac arterial shafts. External iliac arteries with arrosative-dysplastic appearance. None of the focal stenoses that condition the dysplastic appearance of the main renal arteries and the external iliac arteries is significant. Extravascular findings: left adrenal with nodular thickening of adenomatous appearance. Right kidney with small fatty nodule in its lower third compatible with small angiomyolipoma and left kidney with small cortical cyst in its upper third. Calcified uterine myoma. Sigmoid diverticulosis. Conclusion: main renal arteries and external iliac arteries of arrosariado aspect, a finding that suggests fibromuscular dysplasia.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Coronary angiography was performed in the first 24 hours with the finding of epicardial coronary arteries without angiographic lesions in the main vessels, but a sudden decrease in calibre was observed in the third obtuse marginal branch, compatible with spontaneous coronary dissection at that level. Subsequent evolution was favourable, with no complications in the vascular access area or clinical recurrence. A transthoracic echocardiogram was requested with overall systolic function preserved, with no segmental asymmetries at discharge, and no notable valvulopathies. Given the diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection, the study was completed with a body CT scan to detect fibromuscular dysplasia, which was finally confirmed, with involvement of the main renal and external iliac arteries. In a situation of clinical stability, the patient was discharged, indicating cessation of smoking and indefinite taking of simple antiplatelet therapy and high-potency statins.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History The patient is an 80-year-old woman, with a history of: Risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoker of 2-3 cigarettes/day. She has had a dual-chamber pacemaker since July 2015 due to sinus dysfunction and paroxysmal atrioventricular block (AVB) reprogrammed in VVI due to atrial lead failure. In 2014 she was referred to cardiology for gait instability and palpitations. A regular echocardiogram was performed, which revealed a tumour mass in the left atrium, starting from the foramen ovale, probably an atrial myxoma, which slightly interfered with mitral valve kinetics, causing mild dynamic stenosis. One year later, she had an ischaemic stroke of probable cardioembolic origin, and once she had recovered, it was decided to perform surgery on the myxoma, and a complete resection of the myxoma was performed with good results. In 2016 and 2018, she had two episodes of posterior circulation stroke (POCI) of undetermined origin, with diplopia and instability. During these admissions, an echocardiogram was performed, which was normal, and Doppler of the supra-aortic trunk showed moderate stenosis of both carotid arteries, so it was decided to start antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid.  Current disease Admitted in October 2019 for intermittent episodes of gait instability, assessed by neurology, a diagnosis of repeated vertebrobasilar transient ischaemic attack (TIA) was made and she was admitted to complete the study. During admission, an echocardiogram was performed which revealed a mass in the left atrium, suggesting recurrence of myxoma.  Physical examination The patient was conscious and oriented in space and time. No language alterations, preserved nomation. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive. No nystagmus. EOM (external ocular motor) preserved. Examination of cranial nerves normal. Upper and lower limb strength preserved. Examination of superficial and deep sensitivity preserved. Bicipital and patellar osteotendinous reflexes preserved. Finger-nose and finger-finger test with some slowness, possible dysmetria. Romberg's sign doubtful. Stability with increased base of support, unstable gait with lateropulsion to the left. Tandem gait impossible for her. No signs of meningeal irritation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones without audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no extra sounds. Abdomen: soft and depressible, not painful on palpation, no palpable masses or megaliths, no signs of peritoneal irritation, preserved peristalsis. Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pedial pulses were preserved.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 74 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, no repolarisation alterations. Blood tests: biochemistry: glucose 105 mg/dl, urea 22 mg/dl, creatinine 0.66 mg/dl, Na 136 mmol/l, K 4.0 mmol/l. Haemogram: leucocytes 8400/mcl, Hb 13.3 mg/dl, Hto 39.8%, platelets 356000. Coagulation: INR 1.04, AP 99%, fibrinogen 5.9 g/l. Chest X-ray: cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vascularisation within normality. Signs of chronic bronchopneumopathy. No other significant pleuroparenchymal alterations were observed. MCP with electrodes in the right cavities. Mid sternotomy sutures. Dorsal spondylosis Brain computed tomography (CT): signs of chronic ischaemia. Infarcts in the right parietal lobe and at the left parasagittal level next to the convexity, both with an old appearance. Transesophageal echocardiogram: left atrium (LA) of normal dimensions. Inside the left atrium there is an image of a heterogeneous, rounded, echodense mass, 21 x 23 mm in size, with a wide implantation base (15 mm) on the interatrial septum, which does not interfere with the correct kinetics of the mitral valve. Compatible with recurrence of atrial myxoma. Left ventricle not dilated, not hypertrophic. Preserved systolic function, without asymmetry of segmental contractility. Altered diastolic relaxation pattern. Right chambers of normal dimensions, normocontractile right ventricle. Aortic valve trivalve, not limited in its opening and competent. Mitral valve not limited in its opening, with mild mitral insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI), with RV-AD gradient 25 mmHg. Inferior vena cana (IVC) not dilated, with preserved inspiratory collapse. Estimated normal PSAP. Absence of pericardial effusion or intracardiac masses.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During admission to neurology, anticoagulation with synthroid was started and the patient was considered for surgical reintervention. A diagnostic cardiac catheterisation was performed, which revealed coronary arteries without significant lesions, and an evaluation by the geriatrics department estimated a short-term mortality risk of 21%, recommending that surgery should be performed within a period of less than 6 months. Finally, she was re-evaluated in a medical-surgical session, and given the high surgical risk of the patient and her baseline clinical situation, conservative management was decided. During follow-up, she has not presented any further neurological symptoms.  DIAGNOSIS Recurrence of atrial myxoma. Repeated TIA. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 70 bpm. P wave of 0.12 msec, bimodal, predominantly negative in V1, compatible with LA growth. Normal PR. Narrow QRS with axis at 90o. No acute repolarisation alterations. Chest X-ray: PA/LAT projections: normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Pattern of vascular redistribution. Fluid in cystole. No pulmonary condensation or pleural effusion. Blood tests: glucose 85 mg/dl, urea 44 mg/dl, creatinine 0.99 mg/dl, sodium 137 mEq/l, potassium 4.4 mEq/l, albumin 4.5 g/dl, C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.75 mg/l, haemoglobin 13.7 g/dl, platelets 157 *10^3/ƒÊL, leukocytes 17.2 *10^3/ƒÊL, neutrophils 87.1% 43. Echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) not dilated or hypertrophic with preserved function. Diastolic pattern of elongated relaxation. Mild right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Moderately to severely dilated LA. Severely calcified and thickened mitral valve and subvalvular apparatus, predominantly at free edges, with bicommissural fusion, resulting in severe stenosis (area calculated by hemi-pressure time 0.94 cm2 and by planimetry 0.76 cm, with maximum gradient 17 mmHg and mean gradient 13 mmHg). Wilkins scale 13-14 points (mobility 3 points: valve continues to move forward in diastole; subvalvular thickening 3-4 points: extensive thickening extending to distal third of chordae - up to papillary muscles; valvular thickening 4 points: extending over the entire leaflet [8-10 mm]; calcification 3 points: sheen reaching the medial areas of the leaflets). No mitral insufficiency. Calcified aortic valve with mild regurgitation. Mild tricuspid insufficiency. Normal pulmonary pressure. No pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient, who initially attended the emergency department with symptoms compatible with a respiratory infection, was finally diagnosed with severe mitral stenosis on the basis of exploratory and echocardiographic findings. Given the clinical manifestations and severity of the valve disease, it was decided to schedule surgery. Beforehand, the patient underwent an angio-CT scan that ruled out coronary lesions. Given the score of 13-14 on the Wilkins scale, it was decided to replace the valve with a mechanical prosthesis, which was carried out without incident. The patient was discharged home.  DIAGNOSIS Severe mitral stenosis of rheumatic origin. History of rheumatic fever in childhood. Respiratory tract infection. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Young woman who, after excessive cocaine consumption, presented with peripheral embolism and was admitted to our hospital. During hospitalisation, she presented electrocardiographic alterations, elevated markers of myocardial damage and pathological findings on imaging tests that led to the final diagnosis.  HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  FAMILY HISTORY Absence of family history of heart disease.  PERSONAL HISTORY No known allergic drug reactions. No classic cardiovascular risk factors. Toxic habits: sporadic consumption of alcohol and other toxic substances. Non-smoker. Coeliac disease. Previous medication The patient denies taking chronic home medication.  CURRENT ILLNESS This is a 35-year-old woman with coeliac disease, with no other family or personal medical history of interest, who attended the emergency department of the Hospital del Tajo with symptoms compatible with acute arterial ischaemia of the right upper limb, and was transferred to our centre for assessment by vascular surgery. An urgent angio-CT scan was performed which revealed proximal occlusion of the right humeral artery with distal repermeabilisation, probably embolic in nature, and incidentally a filling defect in the left ventricle suggestive of intracavitary thrombus. On questioning the patient, she reported consumption of high doses of toxic alpha-agonists (cocaine) in the previous days, although she denied episodes of chest pain or any other cardiovascular symptoms. An urgent echocardiogram was performed, showing severe apical hypokinesia and severe hypokinesia of distal segments of the lateral face and distal septum, with a visual left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and images compatible with two mobile apical thrombi. Urgent revascularisation surgery with Fogarty probe was successfully performed. Given the electro- and echocardiographic findings, as well as the elevation of myocardial damage markers, once the humeral artery had been repermeabilised, it was decided to perform urgent coronary angiography, which ruled out the presence of coronary lesions. After this, the patient was transferred to the coronary unit under conditions of respiratory and haemodynamic stability and anticoagulation with sodium heparin was started.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP): 90/60 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 85 bpm. Respiratory frequency (RF) 18 rpm. Temperature 37 ̊C. SpO2 98% basal. Conscious, oriented in all three spheres and cooperative. Normal colour, normohydrated and normoperfused. Eupneic at rest, with good respiratory dynamics, tolerating decubitus. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds of good intensity. No murmurs or extratonos were heard. Pulmonary auscultation: vesicular murmur preserved and symmetrical in both hemithoraxes, with no extra sounds. Abdomen: hydro-aerial sounds present and of normal characteristics. Soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, without masses or organomegaly. Lower limbs: pedial pulses present and symmetrical. Absence of oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.

CONCLUSION: Absence of images compatible with ventricular thrombus. Absence of myocardial oedema and late enhancement suggestive of ischaemic heart disease. Qp/Qs 1.33 with presence of partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage with left superior pulmonary vein draining into left brachiocephalic trunk.  CLINICAL COURSE This is a 35-year-old woman with no medical history of interest who was admitted from the Tajo Hospital for peripheral arterial embolism in the right upper limb. The angio-CT scan showed proximal occlusion of the right humeral artery, so a Fogarty catheter embolectomy was performed, as well as, incidentally, an image compatible with intraventricular thrombus. A review of the study revealed an area of subendocardial hypoperfusion with almost transmural extension in apical segments of the anterior septum and a large apical thrombus. An urgent echocardiogram was performed which showed an LVEF of 45% with alterations in apical contractility, confirming the presence of two apical thrombi, so, given the suspicion of complicated acute myocardial infarction of undetermined time of evolution, an urgent coronary angiography was performed which showed normal coronary arteries. He was transferred to the coronary unit, where sodium heparin perfusion was started and, in stable condition, he was transferred to the conventional hospital ward. During his stay there, he presented a new embolic event in the right lower limb despite correct anticoagulation (evidenced by serial controls by aPTT, with frequent adjustments of the sodium heparin infusion rate) which required urgent thrombectomy, with good subsequent evolution. A regular CMR was performed, which showed LVEF recovery, without late enhancement and with resolution of the thrombus. Given the clinical stability and the resolution of the medical-surgical processes that led to his admission, after 10 days of hospitalisation he was discharged from hospital with outpatient monitoring. Anticoagulation with acenocoumarol was decided for 3-6 months with subsequent review in vascular surgery and cardiology consultations.  DIAGNOSIS Cocaine-induced stress cardiomyopathy (tako-tsubo syndrome). Intraventricular thrombus in the context of the above, resolved on discharge. Proximal occlusion of right humeral artery of embolic nature, treated by embolectomy.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY No adverse drug reaction. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): smoking 10 cig/day, dyslipidaemia. Suprarenal incidentaloma in follow-up by endocrinologist: negative catecholamines and metanephrines in urine and normal cortisol.  Cardiological history: Admission for tako-tsubo syndrome in 2017. The electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed ST elevation in the inferior face, so the infarction code was initially activated, showing normal coronary arteries. Ventriculography and echocardiography showed akinesia of all apical segments with preserved contractility at baseline (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] by Simpson 42%), with an image of apical ballooning compatible with tako-tsubo syndrome. Peak ultrasensitive troponin T 568.4 pg/ml. She was discharged with beta-blockers (bisoprolol 2.5 mg) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) (enalapril 2.5 mg). Four months after discharge, a control echocardiogram was performed, showing complete normalisation of contractility alterations and LVEF of 67%. New admission in 2018 for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The ECG in the emergency department showed prominent T waves on the inferolateral side. Elevation of troponin T Us up to 487 pg/ml. Catheterisation with normal coronary arteries, with multiple fistulas from the left coronary tree to the left ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was also requested, with no signs of acute ischaemia, myocarditis or transmural necrosis. It was decided to increase the dose of beta-blocker (bisoprolol to 5 mg/day), aspirin 100 mg/day and atorvastatin 40 mg/day were added.  CURRENT DISEASE A 60-year-old woman came to the emergency department one month after her last admission for an episode of central thoracic oppression lasting one hour, which started at rest and was accompanied by a significant vegetative cortex in the form of profuse sweating and nausea. On arrival at the ED, still symptomatic with slight discomfort in the left hemithorax. Treatment on current admission: bisoprolol 5 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg/day, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/day, hydroferol 0.266 1 capsule per month.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 135/65 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 75 bpm. SatO2 98% (FIO2 21%). Regular general condition, conscious and oriented, cooperative, without focality. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur (VCM) without over-aggregation. Lower limbs: symmetrical without oedema, palpable peripheral pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on arrival, with pain: nodal rhythm at 80 bpm that precedes the sinus P wave with a frequency of about 70 bpm. Narrow QRS, ST-segment depression less than 0.5 mm in II and avF, and up to 1.5 mm in V4-V6, which normalises completely after sublingual caffeine. Laboratory tests: Biochemistry: glucose 162 mg/dl. Urea 42 mg/d. Creatinine 1.03 mg/dl. Sodium 139 mmol/l. Potassium 3.4 mmol/l. C-reactive protein (CRP) 3.0 mg/dl. Total cholesterol 121 mg/dl. Triglycerides 57 mg/dl. HDL cholesterol 43 mg/dl. Calculated LDL cholesterol 78 mg/dl. Haemogram: white blood cells 15.88 x10^9/l. Red blood cells 4.45 x10^12/l. Haemoglobin 14.4 g/dl. Platelets 249 x10^9/l. Haemostasis: PT: 14s, aPTT 35s. Quick 85%. INR 1.0. Myocardial damage markers: ultrasensitive troponin T 10.5 pg/ml --> 280 pg/ml --> 17 pg/ml. Echocardiography: left ventricle (LV) with normal diameters (LVEDD 46 mm), without hypertrophy of its walls and with preserved systolic function (EF 65%). No alterations in segmental contractility were observed at rest. Non-dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function. Normal LV diastolic pattern. Atria of normal size. Aortic root of normal diameter with sigmoid leaflets of normal thickness and opening. No valvular dysfunction. Mitral valve with leaflets of normal thickness and mobility. Trivial central regurgitant jet. Minimal tricuspid insufficiency (TI), in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Absence of pericardial effusion. Ergometry with hyperventilation test: hyperventilation test is performed for 2 minutes without appreciating significant changes in ventricular repolarisation. Subsequently, he exercised according to the Bruce protocol, stopping the test at the beginning of the 4th stage of the Bruce protocol (11 METS) due to maladaptation to the treadmill, not reaching submaximal FC (81% of FCMT) under the effect of beta-blockers. No angina or ST-segment elevation. Correct chronotropic adaptation. Absence of arrhythmia induction. Good functional capacity (> 120% for active women). Coronary catheterisation: left main coronary artery (LMCA): no lesions. Anterior descending artery (ADA): good calibre and development, without lesions. Coronary fistulas to LV. Circumflex artery (ACX): non-dominant without lesions. Right coronary artery (RCA): dominant, without lesions. Vasospasm test with acetylcholine: acetylcholine test was performed with increasing doses in the left coronary artery, with no clinical changes observed in ECG or vasospasm. In ACD, significant spasm was observed (> 75%) associated with nodal rhythm, followed by transient complete atrioventricular block (AVB), reproducing the electrocardiographic alterations in the inferolateral face, present in the admission ECG. Intracoronary nitroglycerin (NTG) was administered, and the procedure was completed without further complications.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient has remained stable since admission to the cardiology ward with no recurrence of the symptoms that led to her admission. Given the presence of ischaemic changes in the admission ECG and relatively recent coronary angiograms without lesions, a hyperventilation test was requested with suspicion of coronary vasospasm, which was normal, so a coronary vasospasm test with acetylcholine was requested. Four injections were performed with increasing doses in the left tree without producing any angiographic or electrocardiographic changes and one injection in the right coronary artery which triggered spasm greater than 75% of the initial vessel calibre with ischaemic changes in the electrocardiogram. Given that the patient under treatment with beta-blockers and ASA has presented recurrences of the current clinical picture, it was decided to discontinue them and start NTG patches, which the patient did not tolerate due to headache and weakness, diltiazem was prescribed in low doses, with good tolerance, so that this drug was maintained at discharge. The importance of smoking cessation was stressed. Several months after admission, the patient remained asymptomatic, with good tolerance to the medication, no changes in her functional class, and no recurrence of episodes of chest pain.  DIAGNOSIS Recurrent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with normal coronary arteries. Vasospastic angina. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 37-year-old woman reported an episode of transfixing interscapular pain radiating to the cervical region and to both upper limbs (MMSS), which had been going on for hours. She reported episodes of chest pain of identical characteristics related to exertion, which subsided with rest, of several months' evolution, without having presented episodes of prolonged chest pain up to the present time, for which she had not consulted. As personal history, he had no known cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and was being followed up by cardiology at a private centre for moderate aortic insufficiency of unknown aetiology, without access to previous echocardiogram images. Vital signs at triage. Blood pressure (BP) 140/80 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 110 bpm. SatO2 (FiO2 21%) 93%. Temperature 37.2 ̊C.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Good general condition, normal colour and normal hydration. Eupneic at rest. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic with systolic murmur III/VI (already known previously). Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without added noise. No lower limb oedema. Radial, femoral and pedial pulses present, bilateral and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) on arrival at the MEDU (with pain): sinus rhythm at 85 bpm. PR 150ms. Narrow QRS with axis in the lower left quadrant. ST elevation of up to 3 mm in avR with generalised ST descent of up to 5 mm. Chest X-ray: normal cardiomediastinal silhouette, without images of consolidation or pleural effusion. Urgent transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) neither dilated nor hypertrophied, with moderately depressed systolic function (Simpson 40-45% with study performed with HR 120-130 bpm), with inferior and lateral hypokinesia at mid and apical levels. Non-dilated right ventricle (RV) with normal TDI. Aortic valve (VAo) apparently tricuspid with hypoplastic non-coronary leaflet and moderate-severe aortic insufficiency with diastolic reverse flow in descending aorta. Mild eccentric mitral insufficiency. No biauricular dilatation. Aortic root, ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta of normal size. Doubtful image in the arch. No IT signal detected to estimate pulmonary artery pressure. Absence of pericardial effusion. CT of the aorta: no signs of aortic dissection, penetrating ulcer or intramural haematoma. No pericardial or pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly. No signs suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism in pulmonary, lobar or segmental arteries. Bilateral diffuse septal thickening suggestive of interstitial oedema. No pulmonary nodules or masses. Air trapping in the apical segment of the left lower lobe (LII). Small area of subpleural ground glass in LII. No mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy. Laboratory tests: Myocardial damage marker curve: ultrasensitive troponin T (TnT us) 480 ----- (4 h) 499. Normal values < 14 pg/ml. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) 2050 pg/ml. Rest of biochemistry, haemogram and coagulation anodine.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After the introduction of perfused nitrates, symptomatology was controlled, the patient remained asymptomatic and the generalised decrease in the ST segment normalised. Given the electrical changes, signs of systolic dysfunction in the urgent echocardiogram and elevated markers of myocardial damage, admission to the coronary unit was decided with a diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and double antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was initiated (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA] + clopidogrel) and antiplatelet treatment with subcutaneous fondaparinux 2.5 mg. 14 hours after admission, early coronary angiography was performed, showing a conical aortic root morphology that made catheterisation of the left coronary trunk (LMCA) impossible due to the recurrent drop in pressure, which was visualised indirectly, with an image of impingement at its origin. The ostium of the right coronary artery (RCA) also appears to be compromised. After performing the diagnostic coronary angiography, the case was discussed again with radiology who, after re-evaluating the images, commented that there was a striking deformity of the circumference of the aortic root, with areas of flattening in the medial wall (forming a conical morphology and thickening of the lateral wall. Both findings may correspond to an intramural haematoma in the aortic root. Absence of visualisation of the outflow ostium of both coronary arteries. The diagnostic study was completed by transesophageal echocardiography, which showed a retraction of the non-coronary leaflet with a regurgitation jet originating at its junction with the right coronary artery, leading to valvular insufficiency that was classified as severe. With this information, the case was discussed with the cardiac surgery department, and the patient was left pending surgical revascularisation. In the following 12 hours, the patient continued to present episodes of precordial pain with dynamic electrical changes, similar to those described previously, which were controlled with antianginal drugs, with markers of myocardial damage on the rise (maximum TnT us of 6000), and she was scheduled for coronary revascularisation surgery 24 hours after her consultation in the emergency department. The surgical report highlights "a severely thickened aortic root wall, which appears to be aortitis. A small ulcer in the wall of the aorta (Ao) is also identified. Trivalve AoA, with thickened leaflets and non-coronary leaflet collapse, which would justify the picture of severe aortic insufficiency (AIo). Coronary ostia with complete occlusion of ACDp and subtotal occlusion of the LMCA. Healthy coronary arteries". With all this, aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a 23 mm mechanical valve + double coronary artery bypass (saphenous to ADAp and saphenous to ACDp) was performed, and samples of the aortic root were sent to pathological anatomy. The patient had a favourable postoperative evaluation, with no complications and a control transthoracic echocardiogram with a normofunctioning aortic valve and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%, with no new episodes of precordial pain and was discharged home 7 days after surgery, with early clinical control in cardiology outpatient clinics. A few weeks later, the results of the pathological anatomy showed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with congestive blood vessels accompanied by haemorrhagic areas suggestive of active aortitis. The excisional biopsy of the valve showed extensive sclerosis and abundant areas of myxoid degeneration, corresponding to scar tissue.  DIAGNOSIS Acute non-infectious aortitis with NSTEMI secondary to involvement of the coronary ostia. Severe aortic insufficiency. Aortic valve replacement and double coronary artery bypass grafting. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient had a good neurological evolution, with recovery ad integrum of the visual defect. He was discharged and referred to the outpatient cardiology department to assess percutaneous closure of the PFO. After joint assessment by neurology and cardiology, he was scheduled for percutaneous closure of the defect. Under general anaesthesia and under echocardiographic control, the foramen was closed. Access was gained through the right femoral vein. The left atrium is passed through the PFO with an MP catheter and a support guidewire is passed into the left superior pulmonary vein. Occlutech 9 F releasing sheath is advanced and the Occlutech Figulla Flex II 30-27 mm closure device is advanced through the sheath and positioned at the level of the atrial septum. After verification of adequate anchorage on transesophageal echocardiography imaging, the device is successfully released.  DIAGNOSIS Cryptogenic right temporo-occipital ischaemic stroke. PFO. PFO closure with Figulla Flex 30-27 mm device. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Ex-smoker (80 pack-years) and former heavy drinker for 7 years. No known metabolic diseases of interest. Cardiological history: self-limited episode of atrial fibrillation (AF), diagnosed 2 months ago in the emergency department, for which oral anticoagulation with acenocoumarol was started. Surgical interventions: cataracts (both eyes). Chronic medication: omeprazole 20 mg/24h, acenocoumarol (according to haematology guidelines) and clomethiazole 192 mg/24h.  CURRENT ILLNESS Referred for cardiology consultation following diagnosis of AF on presentation to the emergency department 2 months ago due to dizziness and loss of consciousness lasting a few seconds, with subsequent recovery ad integrum. AF was recorded in the ED and spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm and treatment was started with acenocoumarol and amiodarone. After 3 weeks of treatment, the patient discontinued amiodarone due to an error in dosage. Currently, he denies dyspnoea, chest pain or palpitations and has not experienced dizziness or syncope. He also reports no constitutional syndrome or other accompanying symptoms and reports leading an active life without limitations.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure 156/89 mmHg. Heart rate 68 bpm. Good general condition. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Eupneic. Thinness and skin pallor. Well perfused. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, no masses or megaliths. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: biochemistry: glucose 108 mg/dl. Urea 32 mg/dl. Creatinine 1.11mg/dl. Sodium 142 mmol/l. Potassium 4 mmol/l. Troponin I ultrasensitive < 17ng/l. Haemogram: 13,550 leucocytes (10,080 neutrophils). Haemoglobin 16.5 g/dl. 182.000 platelets. Coagulation: PT 92%, fibrinogen 509 mg/dl, D-dimer 380 ng/ml. Electrocardiogram (ECG) in the emergency department: AF with ventricular response at 120 bpm, incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), without repolarisation alterations. ECG in cardiology consultation: sinus rhythm (SR) at 68 bpm, normal PR, RBBB, no repolarisation abnormalities. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, no condensation or vascular redistribution. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): non-dilated left ventricle (DTD 47), non-hypertrophic, with normal global systolic function (LVEF 65%), without alterations of segmental contractility. Non-dilated right ventricle, with normal morphology and systolic function (TAPSE 20). Normal mitral filling pattern of impaired relaxation without elevation of filling pressures (E/E ́11). Normal mitral valve. Aortic valve sclerotic, appears trivalve, normal function. Atria of normal size. Atrial septum (AIS) apparently intact. Implanted mass on the atrial side of the tricuspid valve, at lateral level, 2 x 1.8 cm, mottled echocardiographic pattern. Absence of stenosis and minimal tricuspid insufficiency that does not allow estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP). No indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Visible segments of aortic root and arch and pulmonary artery without alterations. Normal inferior vena cava. No pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In view of the echocardiographic findings, the mass implanted on the atrial side of the tricuspid valve was interpreted as a myxoma of atypical location as a first possibility. The diagnostic suspicion and the need for surgical intervention to remove the mass for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is explained to the patient. The patient understands the situation and accepts the procedure; therefore, pre-surgical studies are completed with coronary angiography which shows no coronary lesions. The patient underwent surgery, without incident, and the diagnosis of myxoma was confirmed in the histological study of the excised specimen.  DIAGNOSIS Myxoma located on the atrial side of the tricuspid valve. Paroxysmal AF, first recorded episode, CHA2DVASc 2, HASBLED 1. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION Admitted for study of possible pulmonary hypertension based on the results of transthoracic echocardiography, with indirect data of pulmonary hypertension, severe dilatation and dysfunction of the right ventricle. A complete aetiological study of pulmonary hypertension was performed, with full laboratory tests, respiratory function tests and ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy, with no relevant findings. After ruling out Dana Point groups 2, 3 and 4, a right heart catheterisation was performed, which confirmed precapillary pulmonary hypertension, with a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 48 mmHg, probably related to portopulmonary syndrome given the patient's clinical context. Pulmonary hypertension was classified as intermediate risk, and bosentan and oral tadalafil were started during admission at low doses, with good tolerance, for subsequent titration on an outpatient basis. On the other hand, propranolol was discontinued in agreement with the digestive system specialists due to severe RV dysfunction. On discharge, haemodynamically stable, with minimal right congestion data controlled with low doses of oral furosemide, with no alarm data of pulmonary hypertension. Appointment for follow-up in pulmonary hypertension consultations, pending ergospirometry and 6 ambulatory MWT to complete risk stratification.  DIAGNOSIS Portopulmonary hypertension. WHO functional class III. Intermediate risk. Primary biliary cirrhosis. Chronic portal thrombosis with portal hypertension. Previous episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. No oesophageal varices at last examination. Previous episode of hepatic encephalopathy. Arterial hypertension. Osteoporosis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cardiological history: admission to cardiology from 8/7 to 19/7 for acute myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation (STEMI). A first catheterisation was performed (8/7/2017) which revealed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with acute obstruction of the cuneiform artery (Cx). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with two stents coated in CX with good results. The right coronary artery (RCA) and anterior descending (AD) had significant lesions amenable to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in the second stage. Another catheterisation was performed at a second time (18/7/2017) with scheduled PCI with implantation of two coated stents in the DA, DX and another two in the CD with a good final angiographic result. The echocardiogram performed during admission (8/7/17) reports: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with LVEF 45-50%. Inferolateral hypokinesia. Normal right ventricle (RV). No valvulopathies. Rest normal. From the clinical point of view, no complications during admission. Double antiplatelet therapy was started with ticagrelor, which was later changed to prasugrel (due to possible interaction with antiretrovirals).

CLINICAL COURSE EVOLUTION IN THE CARDIAC REHABILITATION UNIT The patient is included as moderate risk in the programme, attending training sessions 3 days a week for 2 months. He underwent aerobic and strength training, monitored with telemetry for 6 weeks and then with a heart rate monitor for the last 2 weeks, tolerating exercise well. Coronary asymptomatic at all times, no arrhythmias, no episodes of pain. Börg 14-16. In February 2018 he starts with self-limited but recurrent episodes of rectorrhagia with slight anaemisation. After 7 months of the event, it is decided to change prasugrel for clopidogrel, in order to reduce the risk of bleeding. On the other hand, she continued with mixed dyslipidaemia with elevated non-HDL and moderate hypertriglyceridaemia despite treatment with atorvastatin and ezetimibe 80/10 mg. Treatment with fenofibrate 145 mg every 24 hours was started. In the control echocardiogram, left ventricular systolic function remained slightly depressed.  SITUATION AT DISCHARGE In March 2018, the cardiac rehabilitation programme was completed and new ergospirometry was performed, in which a low peak VO2 persisted for his reference population in the context of peripheral exercise limitation; however, the intermediate cardiovascular parameters were acceptable. With regard to the control of cardiovascular risk factors, adherence to the Mediterranean diet improved and the abdominal circumference decreased by 5 cm. In the control analysis, there was a clear improvement in the lipid profile but it was still outside the target ranges in two determinations performed by ultracentrifugation of the sample. She therefore met the criteria for initiation and funding of treatment with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (iPCSK9) inhibitors, and the case was presented to our centre's committee and accepted. In September 2018, he attended the cardiac rehabilitation unit for the administration of the first dose of evolocumab and education. In October 2018, he underwent his first check-up after starting treatment with iPCSK9, with a lipid profile in range. Last control analysis (10/10/18) with ultracentrifugation: triglyceride 98 mg/dl, cholesterol 96 mg/dl, apolipoprotein A1 181 mg/dl, apolipoprotein B 31 mg/dl, lipoprotein (a) 58 mg/dl, lipid ultracentrifugation: VLDL-cholesterol 12 mg/dl, VLDL-triglyceride 83 mg/dl, LDLcholesterol 31 mg/dl, LDL-triglyceride 91 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 65 mg/dl, HDL-triglyceride 7 mg/dl, VLDL cholesterol/triglyceride 0.07, chylomicrons negative. Next check-up in 6 months.  DIAGNOSIS Inferolateral non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in July 2017. Three-vessel CAD. Revascularisation with coated stents in CX (1st time), DA, DX and CD (in 2nd time). Slightly decreased left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 49%). HIV infection on antiretroviral treatment with undetectable viral load. Complete phase II cardiac rehabilitation programme. Mild-moderately reduced aerobic capacity. Severe mixed dyslipidaemia, currently under optimal control on treatment with evolocumab. Hypertension with good control. Smoker in abstinence for 14 months. Overweight. Mild renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate of 64 ml/min). Self-limited rheumatoid arthritis in the context of double antiplatelet therapy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  A 69-year-old man was referred to the outpatient cardiology department for presenting coronary calcifications evidenced in a thoracic CT scan for lung cancer screening. The patient has a history of arterial hypertension (AHT) with good home control, impaired fasting blood glucose (pre-diabetes), obesity (body mass index [BMI] 33.2 kg/m2), past smoking with cumulative exposure of 50 pack-years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) of the chronic bronchitis type and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). His usual treatment consists of simvastatin 10 mg/day, terazosin 2 mg/day, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320/25 mg/day and omeprazole 20 mg/day. He has no chest pain at rest or on exertion or symptoms suggestive of heart failure. He is completely asymptomatic. During the consultation, he was in good general condition, normal colour and normohydrated. Eupneic at rest. Blood pressure (BP) 125/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 65 bpm, SatO2 98% (with room air). Jugular venous pressure normal. Cardiac auscultation is rhythmic with no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation shows preserved vesicular murmur without added sounds. Radial and pedial pulses are palpable, rhythmic and symmetrical. There was no oedema. With the available data, treadmill exercise testing was requested in order to rule out silent myocardial ischaemia.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Chest CT scan without contrast: signs of pulmonary emphysema predominantly in the upper lobes. No visible pulmonary masses or nodules. No adenopathy in the mediastinal region. Severe calcification of coronary arteries (visual CAC-DRS: 3). Slight aortic calcification. Chest X-ray (PA and lateral): no alterations in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. No signs of consolidation, masses or pleural effusion. Apparent calcifications in coronary arteries and aorta. Blood tests: glucose 110 mg/dl, creatinine 0.89 mg/dl, estimated GFR by CKD-EPI 87.51 mg/dl, total cholesterol 215 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 58 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 149 mg/dl, HbA1c 5.6%, haemogram and coagulation without alterations. Baseline ECG: sinus rhythm at 85 bpm. Normal PR (160 ms). Left axis (HSAI). Narrow QRS, q wave in I and aVL. T wave inversion in aVL. Occasional supraventricular extrasystoles. Ergometry on treadmill: performed according to Bruce protocol and stopped due to physical exhaustion. Maximum effort test (maximum HR 157 bpm, 103% theoretical maximum HR) normal. Well tolerated. Adequate adaptation of heart rate and blood pressure (maximum BP 200/100 mmHg). Normal aerobic functional capacity (exercised for 8 minutes and reached a work level of 10.2 METS), adequate double product reserve (19,385). No significant arrhythmias have occurred. No electrocardiographic or clinical signs of inducible ischaemia during the test.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient has remained cardiologically asymptomatic. Given the finding of severe calcification of the coronary arteries by visual score, without clinical angina or evidence of ischaemia in the ergometry, conservative treatment with optimisation of pharmacological treatment was decided upon. The patient was considered at very high risk, so simvastatin 10 mg/day was replaced by rosuvastatin 20 mg/day with a target LDL < 70 mg/dl and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/day was added to the usual treatment. We insisted on hygienic-dietary measures, BP measurements at home and the need for weight loss, as well as the symptoms for which she should consult. Follow-up with blood tests were scheduled to assess LDL cholesterol and impaired fasting blood glucose levels.  DIAGNOSIS Subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Severe coronary calcification, asymptomatic. Very high cardiovascular risk: exobtachism. Dyslipidaemia with suboptimal control. Hypertension with good control. Impaired fasting blood glucose. Obesity. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY No known drug allergies. No known cardiovascular risk factors. No toxic habits. Depressive syndrome. Admitted in 2016 to another hospital for situational syncope and chest pain. Discharged with a diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Usual treatment: fluoxetine 20 mg every 12 hours.  PRESENT ILLNESS A 32-year-old male with the previously described personal history was brought to the emergency department of our hospital for fainting with loss of consciousness not witnessed, coinciding with defecation, and preceded by dizziness and chest pain that continued after regaining consciousness. The patient defines the chest pain as oppressive, radiating to the throat and without associated vegetative cortex, which has subsided spontaneously. He denies palpitations, no dyspnoea or other associated symptoms. The patient reports that the episode is similar to the one he presented in 2016 and that he had not presented any similar symptoms since then. He denies worsening of functional class and no other symptoms from a cardiological point of view. He regularly practises sport and has not presented any infectious symptoms in previous days.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Stable patient in good general condition. Eupneic at rest, tolerating decubitus. Afebrile and haemodynamically stable. Blood pressure (BP) 115/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 58 bpm. No congestive semiology. Cardiorespiratory auscultation with rhythmic tones, no murmurs. Conservative vesicular murmur with no other superimposed noises. Lower limbs without oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: sinus bradycardia at 49 bpm, normal axis, normal PR, narrow QRS with tendency to ST-elevation < 1 mm in inferior aspect, V5-V6. Chest X-ray: CTI in the upper limit of normality. Free costophrenic sinuses. No evidence of pulmonary congestion. No image of pneumothorax, no consolidation. CBC: glucose 77 mg/dl, peak creatinine 1.34 mg/dl (previous normal, at discharge normal), glucose and ions in normal range. Relative neutrophilia without leukocytosis. Haemoglobin 16.2 g/dl. Platelets 218,000. Coagulation without alterations. TnTus 55 - 234 - 72.7 - 5.5 ng/l. CPK 127 - 136 - 121 mU/ml. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 169 mg/dl, HDL 47 mg/dl, LDL 105 mg/dl, triglycerides 84 mg/dl. LDL/HDL 2.2. Autoimmunity test negative. Iron metabolism: sideremia 106.4 micrograms/dl, transferrin 253 mg/dl, transferrin saturation index 30%, ferritin 85 micrograms/litre. Transthoracic echocardiography: left atrium of normal dimensions (AP 37 mm, volume 19 ml/m2). Normal mitral valve, with leaflets without organic involvement, no insufficiency. Left ventricle with slightly increased volumes (DTD 56 mm, DTDi 26 mm/m2, VTD 160 ml, VTDi 80 ml/m2, VTS 66 ml). EF 59% without segmental alterations of contractility. Normal myocardial thickness, with 8 mm septum and 8 mm posterior wall. Normal mitral filling pattern with E wave 69 cm/s and A wave 38 cm/s. Septal E" 7 cm/s and lateral E" 15.3 cm/s. Trivalve aortic valve, with anatomically normal leaflets, without insufficiency. Sinuses of Valsalva 36 mm. Right ventricle of normal dimensions and contractility. TAPSE 22 mm, tricuspid S" 12.7 cm/s. Trivial tricuspid insufficiency with Vmax 2m/s. Mild pulmonary insufficiency. Normal inferior vena cava with adequate inspiratory collapse. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure 19 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Coronary angio-CT: Agastson calcium score of 1 (no identifiable plaques). Coronary angiography from axial slices, multiplanar, curved and 3D reconstructions: left common trunk arising from the left coronary sinus, long, 21 mm long and without significant alterations. It bifurcates into the anterior descending artery (ADA) and circumflex artery (ACx). ADA without angiographically significant lesions, of good development and calibre, giving multiple diagonal branches of small calibre (up to 3 diagonal branches), all of them without lesions. ACx without angiographically significant alterations, which is of small calibre, but almost at its origin gives an Om1 branch of very good development and calibre, which has a normal proximal trajectory, but its entire middle and distal course follows an intramyocardial route presenting an "intramyocardial bridge of significant length" and which in systolic sections shows a decrease in its calibre and systolic compression phenomenon (coincides with the inferolateral side as it depends on the circumflex artery and the course of an OM artery). Right coronary artery (RCA) arising from the right coronary sinus without angiographically significant alterations. It gives two posterolateral branches, but does not clearly give the posterior descending branch or this is a very small branch. Right dominant pattern. Conclusion: OM1 of very good development and calibre, which has a normal proximal trajectory, but its entire middle and distal trajectory follows an intramyocardial course presenting an "intramyocardial bridge of significant length" and which in systolic sections presents a decrease in its calibre and a phenomenon of systolic compression. The trajectory has been estimated at 7.5-8 cm. The rest of the coronary arteries had no angiographically significant lesions, no anomalies in their trajectory or disposition.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After documenting in enzyme serology in the emergency department, discrete enzyme mobilisation with ischaemia curve (peak TNT Us: 234 ng/l), it was decided to admit the patient to cardiology on suspicion of a new episode of myopericarditis given his history. During his admission, the patient evolved favourably, with no further chest pain and no other symptoms. Given that the clinical picture was not characteristic of myopericarditis, due to its characteristics and duration, nor did he present compatible electrical alterations, with alterations on the underside more suggestive of ischaemic aetiology, as well as the behaviour of the cardiac ferment serum, with a very rapid rise and fall, again more characteristic of an ischaemic profile, it was decided to request an intermediate test to detect ischaemia during admission as a screening test for coronary artery disease. A coronary angio-CT scan was performed which revealed the existence of an intramyocardial tract of significant length in the OM1 branch and which in the systolic sections showed a decrease in its calibre and systolic compression phenomenon, with the rest of the coronary arteries being normal. Given the findings, it is considered that the picture of situational vagal syncope with associated hypotension and the presence of the long intramyocardial tract would explain the picture of transient ischaemia that led to admission. The patient also provided the report of the cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) performed in the previous admission in 2016, which described the presence of mild enhancement of predominantly subendocardial enhancement in the inferolateral wall, coinciding with the trajectory and could be explained by this same reason. Given the good evolution, the patient was discharged with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg every 24 hours and amlodipine 5 mg every 12 hours. It is recommended to avoid high intensity exercise, especially isometric exercise (weight lifting). The patient is seen in an outpatient clinic 2 months later and remains asymptomatic.  DIAGNOSIS Myocardial infarction with coronary arteries without obstructive lesions (MINOCA) secondary to significant intramyocardial trajectory of the obtuse marginal artery with systolic compression phenomenon. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 45-year-old man with an active life, currently asymptomatic, who came to the echocardiography department of our hospital for transesophageal monitoring after percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage with an Amulet device (St Jude Medical) due to repeated strokes despite having been under anticoagulant treatment.  PERSONAL HISTORY Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): hypertension. Dyslipidaemia. Smoker of 7-8 cigarettes a day (10.5 packs a year) Cardiological history: Permanent atrial fibrillation diagnosed in December 2001 (2 unsuccessful attempts at CVE in 2002 after which frequency control strategy was chosen). Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle of normal diameters and volumes, with preserved global systolic function (LVEF 58%). Very dilated left atrium (volume 4c 154 ml). Transmitral filling with single E wave. Absence of significant valvular heart disease. Right ventricle with preserved diameters and global systolic function. Absence of tricuspid insufficiency (TI) allowing estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PsAP). Percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage with Amulet device (St. Jude Medical) in 2018: In 2016, the patient presented with a stroke with a cardioembolic profile under treatment with acenocoumarol anticoagulation with poor INR control, so acenocoumarol was discontinued and rivaroxaban was started. Under treatment with rivaroxaban 20 mg/24 hours correctly adjusted to his renal function, he suffered a new cardioembolic stroke in 2017, so it was decided to close his left atrial appendage. In 2018, percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage was performed with an Amulet device (St. Jude Medical) without complications. On discharge, following the recommendations of the commercial company, double antiplatelet therapy was started with aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg. Although, according to the guidelines, the patient had an indication for anticoagulant treatment due to the risk of stroke, this was rejected because he had experienced minor bleeding episodes during treatment with rivaroxaban. Other medical history: Repeated cardioembolic stroke (2016 and 2017) expressed as TIA, despite anticoagulation. The first of these was located in the left occipital lobe, confirmed by imaging techniques. The second was in the left carotid profile and was not confirmed by imaging techniques. Clinical criteria of chronic bronchitis without respiratory functional tests Surgical interventions: gastric bypass. Supraumbilical hernia. Current treatment: Foli-Doce 1 (tablet per day), olmesartan + HCT 40/25 mg, atenolol 50 mg (1 tablet per day), atorvastatin 20 mg (1 tablet per day), acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg (1 tablet per day).  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Good general condition, conscious, oriented, normohydrated and normal colour. Blood pressure (BP) 132/76 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 67 bpm, SatO2 94% (FiO2 21%). Cardiac auscultation: irregular sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: slight global hypophonesis, with scattered rhonchi. Soft abdomen with no masses or megaliths, not painful on palpation. Lower extremities without oedema. Peripheral pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: Blood count: haemoglobin 15.1 g/dL. MCV 84 fl. MCH 30.7 pg. Leukocytes 5.8x10*9/l. Platelets 316x10*9/l. Biochemistry: glucose 83 mg/dl. HbA1c 5.8%. Sodium 138 mEq/l. Potassium 4.3 mEq/l. Chlorine 104 mEq/l. Bilirubin 0.46 mg/dl. GOT 16 U/l. GPT 14 U/l. Alkaline phosphatase 77 U/l. Gamma-glutamyl transferase 13 U/l. Creatinine 0.96 mg/dl (GFR CKD-EPI > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2). Iron metabolism: transferrin 249 mg/dl. Ferritin 26 ug/l. Iron 60 ug/l, IST 17.8%. Lipid metabolism: total cholesterol 150 mg/dl. Triglycerides 64 mg/dl. HDLc 34 mg/dl. LDLc 126 mg/dl. Haemostasis: prothrombin time 12 s, IQ 84%. INR 1.03. APTT 27.3 s. Electrocardiogram (ECG): atrial fibrillation with MVR at 67 bpm. Axis 15o. QRS 90 ms. non-significant Q wave and negative T in dIII. Flattened T in avF. No other repolarisation alterations. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) (2D and 3D) 5 months after implantation of atrial appendage closure device: marked left atrial dilatation (volume 4c 175 ml) with presence of spontaneous echocontrast. An image suggestive of a small protruding thrombus is seen on the disc of the normally positioned atrial appendage closure device. Left ventricle with increased diameters and normal global systolic function (LVEF 60%). Absence of significant valvular heart disease. Right ventricle with normal diameters and preserved function. Absence of IT allowing estimation of PsAP. Exploration in atrial fibrillation.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Taking into account that the patient was an asymptomatic 45-year-old man who, although he had correctly completed the double antiplatelet therapy prescribed according to the recommendations of the device manufacturer, without anticoagulant treatment by the patient's own decision, a thrombosis of the Amulet device (St Jude Medical) for closure of the left atrial appendage was detected in the control TEE. It was decided to restart anticoagulant treatment with acenocoumarol with INR targets (2-3). Three months later a new follow-up TEE was performed and the thrombus had resolved. However, despite the resolution of the condition, it was decided to maintain oral anticoagulation with acenocoumarol (INR 2-3) and to perform a new echocardiographic control in 12 months, in order to assess the definitive withdrawal of anticoagulant treatment. At present, 8 months have passed and the patient remains asymptomatic, without haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications, under treatment with acenocoumarol and awaiting a repeat transesophageal echocardiography control.  DIAGNOSIS Permanent atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response. CHA2DS2VAS-c 3, HASBLED 2. Two strokes with cardioembolic profile despite anticoagulation with acenocoumarol or rivaroxaban (left atrial appendage preclosure). Left atrial appendage closure with Amulet device (St Jude Medical). Thrombosis on left atrial appendage closure device, resolved with oral anticoagulation with acenocoumarol. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY Intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) due to duodenal ulcer. CVRF: smoking (20 pack-years). No known cardiological history. Other history: duodenal ulcer 10 years ago. No relevant surgical interventions. Usual treatment: not reported.  CURRENT ILLNESS A 57-year-old male patient with the aforementioned history attended the emergency department of our centre due to oppressive central thoracic pain, of about 30 minutes' evolution, radiating to both upper limbs (MMSS) and neck, which started suddenly while at rest, with associated mild vegetative cramping. On arrival at the emergency department, the clinical manifestations persisted. She denied previous episodes of central thoracic pain. She reported an active daily life. No clinical signs of CHF or infectious disease in previous days.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 140/60 mmHg (left arm), 90/50 mmHg (right arm), heart rate (HR) 65 bpm. SpO2 (FiO2 21%) 99%. Regular general condition, affected by severe pain. Eupneic at rest. Normal colour and normohydrated. Sweating. Patient conscious and oriented, cooperative and alert. No neurological focality. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: regular sounds, diastolic murmur predominantly in the left sternal border. Conservative vesicular murmur (VCM) with no added noise. Abdomen: soft and depressible, without mass or megaliths, not painful on palpation. MMSS: asymmetric radial pulses. Lower limbs: weak and symmetrical distal pulses.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on arrival at the ED: sinus rhythm at 95 bpm, PR 170 ms, narrow QRS, 0o axis, LVH criteria. No changes in serial ECG. Initial laboratory tests: CBC: red blood cells *4,62 10*12/l. Haemoglobin 14.3 g/dl. Haematocrit 42.9%. VCM 92.9 fl. HCM 30.9 pg. CHCM 33.3 g/l. ADE 13.1%. Leukocytes 8.6 10*9/l. Neutrophils 54.6%. Lymphocytes 32,2%. Platelets 198 10*9/l. Haemostasis: prothrombin time (PT) 11 sec. Quick's index 100%, INR 0.95. APTT 28.7 sec. Biochemistry: glucose *103 mg/dl. Sodium 139 mEq/l. Potassium 4.3 mEq/l. Chlorine 103 mEq/l. Urea 34.2 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.86 mg/dl. Biomarkers of myocardial damage: troponin I (hsTnI) 3,2 ng/l. Urgent echocardiogram (TTE) in critical care unit (no images available): left ventricle with slight concentric hypertrophy, normal diameters and preserved systolic function, with no alterations in segmental contractility at rest. Significant aortic insufficiency, without other valvulopathies. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Aortic root with increased diameters (45 mm), without a clear flap image. Normal inferior vena cava (IVC). Mild pericardial effusion. Angio-CT of the aorta: type A aortic dissection with involvement of the aortic root extending along the anterior aspect of the aortic wall close to the left coronary trunk (LMCA) from the valvular plane to the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery with involvement of the proximal origin of the ASD. Dilatation of aortic root and tubular portion of ascending aorta (47 mm). Descending aorta 37 mm. Descending aorta 31 mm. At the level of the thoraco-abdominal aorta, the true lumen has a reduced calibre. The celiac, superior mesenteric and right renal trunks originate from the true lumen. The left renal arises from a gateway between the true lumen and the false lumen with good renal perfusion. Distal aorta and normal iliofemoral sector. Conclusion: type A dissection extending from the aortic root to the aortic segment proximal to the inferior mesenteric origin.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In a patient with intense oppressive chest pain, without significant ECG alterations suggestive of ischaemia, it was decided to perform an urgent TTE, which revealed aortic root dilatation with significant insufficiency. In view of these findings, it was decided to request an angio-CT scan, which confirmed the diagnosis of type A aortic dissection. With the results of the complementary examinations and the diagnosis, the cardiac surgery department was contacted and emergency surgery was performed using the mechanical Bono-Bentall technique (Carboseal 29 mm) (consisting of aortic valve replacement, aortic root and ascending aorta replacement, as well as coronary ostium reimplantation in the same surgical procedure), under extracorporeal circulation, electromechanical heart arrest and circulatory arrest with selective bicarotídeal cerebral perfusion. No replacement of the aortic arch or descending aorta was performed, given the critical condition of the patient, the complexity of the intervention and the improvement after elimination of the main tear and reinstatement of true lumen flow. Evolution in ICU: prolonged stay to 8 days after emergent Bentall surgery. Early extubation at 12 h post IQ without incident. At 48 hours the patient developed global respiratory failure oriented as postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by congruent radiography with image of scattered infiltrates in both lung fields with heterogeneous distribution. Influenza A negative PCR. He required high-flow nasal spectacles, with progressive improvement. On the other hand, acute renal failure resolved. Haemodynamically, the patient remained stable from the immediate postoperative period, with no signs of active bleeding and no transfusion requirements. Good evolution in the cardiac surgery room, with discharge home on 7/3/19.  DIAGNOSIS Type A acute aortic dissection. Emergent surgery with metallic Bono-Bentall. Smoking. Arterial hypertension. Acute respiratory failure due to ARDS. Resolved prerenal renal failure. |O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY Male, 43 years old, regular moderate-high intensity sportsman. No drug allergies. No toxic habits or cardiovascular risk factors. No previous cardiological history. Migraine with aura studied in 2015 with brain MRI without pathological findings and asymptomatic since then. No surgical interventions or chronic treatments.  CURRENT ILLNESS A 43-year-old male presented with sudden loss of consciousness while performing moderate-intensity physical exercise (running), with no previous clinical manifestations. The witnesses who accompanied him reported having observed him fall to the ground with no response to stimuli and with no spontaneous breathing and no palpable pulse, so they started basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) manoeuvres and called the emergency services. On arrival of the medical team, ventricular fibrillation was detected. A single effective shock was administered, achieving sinus rhythm with a pulse. He was immediately transferred to the reference centre sedated and anaesthetised, with orotracheal intubation on mechanical ventilation and haemodynamically stable without amines.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Anthropometric data: weight 74 kg, height 1.82m. Body mass index (BMI) 22.3 kg/m2. Vital signs: blood pressure (BP) 104/82 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 62 bpm. O2 saturation (SatO2) 98% with FiO2 at 21%. Cardiovascular: jugular venous pressure normal. Hepatojugular reflex negative. Cardiac auscultation: regular, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. No aggregates. Abdomen: flat. Hydro-aerial sounds present. Soft, depressible. No visceromegaly. Neurological: isochoric pupils. Pupillary reflexes preserved. Motor reflexes in extremities without alterations (II/IV). Extremities: no oedema. Peripheral pulses preserved and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 93 bpm. PR 120 ms. QRS 60 ms. QTc 398ms. No repolarisation alterations. Admission blood tests: haemoglobin 16 g/dl, haematocrit 47.5%, platelets 223,000 /μl, leukocytes 7,400 /μl. International normalised ratio (INR) 1.05. Basal glycaemia 82 mg/dl. Urea 36 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.81 mg/dl. Sodium 137 mEq/l. Potassium 4.1 mEq/l. Myocardial damage markers: troponin I US: 0.0 ng/ml. Chest X-ray: centred cardiomediastinal silhouette. CTI less than 0.5. Lung fields without condensation or pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle with preserved diameters, volumes and global systolic function (LVEF 65%). Absence of alterations in segmental contractility at rest. Normal transmitral filling pattern. Absence of significant valvulopathies. Normal left atrium. Normal right ventricle. Absence of tricuspid insufficiency (TI) allowing estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PAPs) without data suggestive of pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Normal inferior vena cava (IVC). Exploration in sinus rhythm. Coronary angiography: epicardial coronary arteries without atheromatosis. Anomalous origin of the left coronary throne (LCT) in the right sinus of Valsalva, high and anterior, opposite to the origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) which is filled during the administration of contrast in the cannulation of the LCT. Possible interarterial tract of the LMCA. Coronary CT angiography: trivalve aortic valve with preserved diameters. The presence of an LMCA with origin in the right sinus of Valsalva and interarterial trajectory (between the pulmonary trunk and the aorta) is confirmed. Descending artery with evidence of large diagonal without significant lesions. Circumflex artery without lesions. Origin of the right coronary artery in the right sinus of Valsalva without lesions. Conclusion: origin of the left coronary artery in the right sinus of Valsalva with interarterial trajectory. Post-surgical ergometry: maximal test stopped at 13:33 minutes of the Bruce protocol (14.5 METS) due to physical exhaustion. No angina or ST segment alterations that meet the criteria for positivity in relation to the baseline electrocardiogram. No arrhythmias. Adequate blood pressure and chronotropic response. Good functional capacity. Post-surgical stress echocardiogram: cycloergometer stress test. Maximum test reaching 103% of the maximum theoretical heart rate. Performs a total of 15 minutes 26 seconds of exercise, corresponding to 1 minute 27 seconds of stage 8 of the WHO protocol (200 watts). No alterations in segmental contractility were observed at rest or on exertion, with no electrical changes or chest pain.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Young man with cardiorespiratory arrest recovered in ventricular fibrillation during moderate exertion, presenting post-CRP electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm, without repolarisation alterations and with normal QTc interval. An emergent echocardiogram showed no abnormalities with normal LVEF, no indirect signs of massive pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), no aortic flap and no pericardial effusion. The emergency chest X-ray ruled out pneumothorax. Arterial blood gas analysis showed hyperlactacidemia with other parameters and normal haemoglobin levels. Emergent brain computed tomography (CT) without haemorrhagic or acute ischaemic event. Given the normality of the initial aetiological studies, it was decided to perform an emergent coronary angiography where epicardial arteries were found without angiographic lesions with anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) in the right sinus of Valsalva with a possible interarterial trajectory. Admitted to the coronary unit, haemodynamically stable without the need for amines, in sinus rhythm without arrhythmic events and allowing progress in weaning with early extubation in the first 48 hours with no neurological deficit. Studies were completed with CT of the coronary arteries which confirmed the anomalous origin of the LMCA in the right sinus of Valsalva with interarterial trajectory. During his admission to the coronary unit he remained asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable. The case was discussed in a medical-surgical session and it was decided to perform surgery with double bypass implantation: right mammary artery to obtuse marginal artery and left mammary artery to anterior descending artery with a favourable postoperative period with no incidents. The patient remained asymptomatic in subsequent outpatient check-ups. Ergometry and stress echocardiography were performed, both tests being maximal and negative for ischaemia.  DIAGNOSIS Cardiorespiratory arrest during physical exercise in ventricular fibrillation. Anomalous origin of the left coronary trunk from the right sinus of Valsalva with interarterial trajectory. Surgical revascularisation with double bypass. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 71-year-old woman, with no toxic habits or cardiovascular risk factors and with a personal history of aortic sclerosis, hypertensive heart disease, recurrent paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and renal lithiasis, attended the emergency department for oppressive central thoracic pain, not radiating or associated with vegetative cortex, which did not change with palpation, deep inspiration or movement, lasting about 3 hours. He denied orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, palpitations, dyspnoea at rest/exertion, malleolar oedema or reduced diuresis. He had not made any dietary transgressions or modified his usual medication. As a point of interest, she commented that she had gone to the dentist hours earlier having undergone a root canal. On arrival at the emergency department the patient was stable, normotensive (124/74 mmHg), with heart rate (78 bpm) and oxygen saturation (98% baseline) normal. Afebrile. Conscious and oriented, good general condition, eupneic at rest, normohydrated, normo-coloured and normoperfused. Carotid pulses were rhythmic and symmetrical and we did not detect jugular ingurgitation. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was rhythmic and without murmurs, with subcrepitant rales from middle and lower lung fields. Abdominal examination revealed a soft and depressible abdomen, no pain on superficial or deep palpation, no masses or megaliths, generalised tympanism, no peritonism and positive hydro-aerial sounds. The lower extremities showed no malleolar oedema; pedial and posterior tibial pulses were present and symmetrical, with no stigmata of venous insufficiency or deep vein thrombosis. No skin rash was observed.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood analysis: haemoglobin 12.9 g/dl, hcto 38.7%, MCH 26 pg, MCV 78.2 fl, leukocytes 13300/microlitre, platelets 200000/microlitre, normal biochemistry, CPK 1127 IU/l peak (30 - 200 IU/l), CK-MB 119.11 ng/ml peak (< 6 ng/ml) and troponin-I 29.130 ng/ml peak (< 0.06), normal renal function, normal ions and normal coagulation. Anteroposterior chest X-ray (portable): preserved cardiothoracic index, vascular redistribution with bilateral bronchovascular enhancement and bilateral and diffuse interstitial infiltrates Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm, PR 180 msec, narrow QRS, QRS axis at 30o, ST-segment elevation in II, III, AVF, V3-V6. QTc 394 msec. Catheterisation: right dominance. Right coronary artery of good calibre and development, without lesions. Anterior descending artery of good calibre, with very distal thrombotic occlusion, this being a very long vessel, which appears to go around the apex. Circumflex artery of intermediate calibre and good development, without lesions. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophied, with apical akinesia, diastolic pattern of impaired relaxation and preserved systolic function (LVEF 55% by Simpson biplane). Right and left atrium of normal size. Right ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophied, with normal systolic function (TAPSE >18 mm). Mitral valve of normal morphology, with good opening and no regurgitant jets. Aortic valve of trivalve morphology, with restriction of its opening in the range of moderate stenosis (GP 53 mmHg) and regurgitant jet that conditioned mild aortic insufficiency (AIo), without apparent dilatation of the aortic root. Morphologically normal tricuspid valve, with good opening and mild insufficiency, did not allow adequate estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PSAP) (although there were no indirect signs of pulmonary hypertension [PHT]). Pericardium of normal thickness and refractoriness, without effusion, and non-dilated inferior vena cava, with collapse > 50% with inspiration Cardio-MRI with gadolinium: apical anteroseptal akinesia with subendocardial uptake greater than 50% at the apical and strict apical anteroseptal level, and less than 50% in the basal anterolateral region. Rest of the study without alterations.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION A loading dose of double antiplatelet therapy was administered and antianginal medical treatment was started. Given the persistence of the clinical and electrocardiographic findings, an urgent catheterisation was performed, which showed thrombotic occlusion of the anterior descending artery at a very distal level, this being a very long vessel, which probably went around the apex. Ventriculography showed anterior-apical and inferior-apical hypokinesia. Neither thromboaspiration nor coronary angioplasty was performed due to the distal location of the thrombus and he was treated with double antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation. He was then transferred to the coronary unit, where enzymatic and electrocardiographic serialisation was completed. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a non-dilated and non-hypertrophied left ventricle with septoapical akinesia, diastolic pattern of impaired relaxation and preserved systolic function (LVEF 55% by Simpson biplane). Right and left atrium of normal size. Right ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophied, with normal systolic function (TAPSE > 18 mm). Mitral valve of normal morphology, with good opening and no regurgitant jets. Aortic valve of trivalve morphology, with restriction of its opening in the range of moderate stenosis (GP 53 mmHg) and regurgitant jet that conditioned mild AoI, without apparent dilatation of the aortic root. Morphologically normal tricuspid valve, with good opening and mild insufficiency, did not allow adequate estimation of PSAP (although there were no indirect signs of PHT). Pericardium of normal thickness and refractoriness, without effusion, and non-dilated inferior vena cava, with collapse > 50% with inspiration. During his stay in the unit he remained cardiologically stable, with blood pressure figures with a tendency to hypotension and afebrile. She did not present new episodes of angina at rest/light exertion, palpitations or dyspnoea. Given the clinical and haemodynamic stability, the patient was discharged to the cardiology ward. Prior to discharge, the patient provided the report of the dental extraction performed a few hours before the onset of the symptoms, in a private centre, which included the use of a local anaesthetic consisting of lidocaine 2% (36 mg) + epinephrine (0.0225 mg). Subsequently, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium was performed, which revealed apical anteroseptal akinesia with subendocardial uptake greater than 50% at the apical and strict apical anteroseptal level, and less than 50% in the basal anterolateral region, all compatible with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a first possibility. Thus, the patient was discharged with hygienic-dietary recommendations, double antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and statins. One year later, the patient remains clinically asymptomatic, with no alterations in segmental contractility by echocardiography.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY The patient is a 52-year-old female active smoker with chronic non-revascularised ischaemic heart disease and preserved ventricular function. She made her debut in October 2018 as a non-ST-elevation Killip I acute myocardial infarction, diagnosed by coronary angiography as spontaneous coronary artery dissection with haematoma image in the posterior interventricular branch. She progressed favourably with medical treatment and was discharged without complications after 72 hours of hospitalisation. She had no family history of early sudden death or cardiovascular disease. She is being treated with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg at lunch, bisoprolol 2.5 mg at breakfast, atorvastatin 40 mg at dinner and omeprazole 20 mg at breakfast.  CURRENT ILLNESS Consultation in November 2018 for sudden syncope while standing upright, with spontaneous recovery and no periepisodic symptoms (palpitations, dizziness, sweating, nausea, etc.). She denied recurrent angina in the previous days, changes in medication or other intercurrent events (infections, etc.) that could have acted as triggers. On arrival at the emergency department, telemetry monitoring was started pending the results of the complementary tests and assessment by the on-call cardiologist. In the meantime, he presented with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that rapidly degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation) after single electrical cardioversion (ECV) and iv amiodarone embolisation. Subsequently, she presented with a new rhythm of ventricular fibrillation (VF) with ROSC after two ECV. She remained asymptomatic and was admitted to the acute cardiac care unit (ACCU) for monitoring. With no new arrhythmic events or heart failure since admission, she was transferred to the hospital ward.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 165/80 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 85 bpm. Good general appearance. Capillary refill < 2 seconds, no sweating. Eupneic in decubitus. No jugular ingurgitation. Rhythmic cardiac auscultation without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur, without added sounds. No oedema in the lower limbs or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm with normopositioned narrow QRS and adequate progression in precordial leads. Small non-significant q wave in III and aVF. No repolarisation alterations. ECG on discharge: no relevant changes. Urgent blood tests on arrival: haemoglobin 14 g/dl (volumes and indices within normal ranges), platelets 275000/ul, leukocytes 9520/ul with normal formula. INR 1.02, APTT 27.2 sec. Glucose 99 mg/dl. Uric acid 4.8 mg/dl. ALT 28 U/l. GGT 34 U/l. Alkaline phosphatase 110 U/l. Creatinine 0.57 mg/dl (estimated glomerular filtration rate > 60 ml/min/1.73 m2), sodium 144 mmol/l, potassium 4.1 mmol/l, C-reactive protein 1.7 mg/dl. Peak myocardial damage markers on serialisation: ultrasensitive troponin I 392 ng/l (normal < 15.6), CK 186 U/l (normal < 192). Blood tests with profiles: glycosylated haemoglobin 6.3%, TSH 1.55 mIU/l, total cholesterol 125 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 51 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 47 mg/dl, triglycerides 134 mg/dl. Transthoracic echocardiogram: biventricular function preserved without valvulopathy or cavity dilatation. Akinesia of the middle and distal segments of the inferior face and hypokinesia of the middle and distal segments of the inferolateral face. Cardiac MRI with contrast: non-dilated left ventricle, with normal thickness. Focal dyskinesia of the mediodistal segment of the inferior face. Akinesia of the inferior distal segment and inferolateral segment respecting the strictly apical segment. Rest of segmental contraction without alterations. Normal global systolic function (LVEF 55%). T2-STIR sequences show a very localised hyperintense transmural area in the distal segment of the inferior face with subendocardial extension towards the apex. Perfusion in first subendocardial perfusion defect affecting the distal thirds of the inferior septum, inferior and inferolateral aspect. T2 MAPs at septal level: 49 ms (within normal limits), at distal lateral level: 72 ms (value above normal, suggestive of acute inflammation) T1 MAPs native septal value: 1013 +/- 30 ms (within normal limits). Late enhancement: an area of enhancement compatible with an ischaemic eschar occupying approximately 70% of the myocardial thickness is observed in the distal segment of the inferior and inferolateral face respecting the apex. Minimal subendocardial focus in the distal lateral aspect. Right ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic. No alterations of segmental contraction. Normal systolic function. No late enhancement foci. Left and right atrium of normal size. Mitral valve with thin leaflets, normal opening. Trivalve aortic valve, functionally normal. Sinus aorta not dilated. Coronary angiography: short left main coronary artery, without lesions. Anterior descending artery of good development and calibre, without lesions. Circumflex artery of good development and calibre, without lesions. Right coronary artery: vessel of good development and calibre, with an image suggestive of haematoma in the posterior interventricular branch, with a vessel distal to the lesion of small calibre and short course. Study superimposed on the one performed 10 days earlier.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient evolved favourably, with no new arrhythmic events after transfer to the hospital ward. Beta-blockers were prescribed up to the maximum tolerated dose, as well as other antihypertensive drugs. Coronary angiography showed persistence of haematoma in PVI and only discrete acute myocardial damage in the context of ventricular arrhythmias and resuscitation. Therefore, ruling out the existence of new dissections, progression of the previous one or other potential triggers of ventricular fibrillation, it was decided to implant a subcutaneous ICD for secondary prevention in a patient with ischaemic heart disease with preserved ventricular function and recovered sudden death. After this, the patient was discharged  DIAGNOSIS In-hospital cardiac arrest recovered in ventricular fibrillation. Chronic ischaemic heart disease: inferior infarction. Spontaneous PVI coronary artery dissection. Preserved systolic ventricular function. Subcutaneous ICD implantation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Patient aged 15 years. Correct vaccination schedule, with no relevant history at birth, during the neonatal period or in childhood. His father reported that he had a "benign murmur" at cardiac level, discharged without further check-ups. Personal history of streptococcal pharyngitis and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Absence of usual treatment. He came to the emergency department after finding elevated blood pressure: 210/90 mmHg, asymptomatic, taken at home with a blood pressure monitor. Given the patient's age and the suspicion of secondary hypertension, nephrological assessment was requested. Following blood and urine tests with no findings and a normal abdominal ultrasound scan, we requested an assessment by us. His grandfather, who was undergoing treatment for hypertension, measured his blood pressure (BP) daily. As an entertainment, imitating his grandfather, he started to use his blood pressure monitor, with a very different result to the expected... He tells us that in the last two weeks he has been taking daily BP readings, with average BPs of 160-170 mmHg. Today, on finding a higher figure than usual, he decided to go to the emergency room. Asymptomatic, no neurological or cardiovascular symptoms. Physical examination showed good general condition, correct growth and development. Normal features. BP after initiation of short half-life antihypertensive drugs 159/92 mmHg. Heart rate 80 bpm, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation normal ventilation, interscapular systolic murmur. Radial pulses present and symmetrical. Femoral and pedial pulses decreased. BP measurement in both arms and legs with the following result: ESD 155/85 mmHg, ESI 142/81 mmHg, EID 105/65 mmHg, EII 105/70 mmHg.  S ECG: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Revisema a Narrow QRS, normal axis around 70o. LV hypertrophy criteria: Sokolow-Lyon 39 mm. No relevant repolarisation alterations. Chest X-ray: Roesler's notches and 3's sign with absence of aortic button. Echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle (LV), moderate concentric LV hypertrophy (12 mm). Preserved systolic function (EF 68%), without alterations of segmental wall contractility. Normal diastolic pattern. Right ventricle of normal size, preserved function (TAPSE 22 mm). Atria of normal size. Mitral valve: thin leaflets, preserved opening kinetics. No reflux. Mild TR. PAPS 33 mmHg. Bicuspid type I aortic valve (VAo) with fusion of right coronary leaflet and left coronary leaflet. Preserved opening kinetics, mild central regurgitation jet. Aortic root, visualised ascending aorta and aortic arch of normal size (29 mm). Coarctation of the aorta after left subclavian outflow with a diameter of 4 mm, peak systolic gradient of 63 mmHg and significant diastolic prolongation. Distal aortic arch 13 mm. Continuous abdominal aortic Doppler with peak systolic at 0.86 m/s. Decreased protomesosystolic flow in left femoral artery without protodiastolic inversion. Inferior vena cava not dilated, with preserved inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. Chest CT angiography: aortic coarctation with severe compromise of the aortic lumen (minimum diameter in the coarctation 5 mm). Presence of abundant collateral circulation through internal mammary, intercostal and posterior scapular arteries. Bicuspid aortic valve.  MIX DUB After initial suspicion based on anamnesis and physical examination findings, an echocardiogram was performed, confirming the presumptive diagnosis: coarctation of the aorta and secondary hypertension. He was admitted to the cardiology ward for blood pressure control and to complete the study. Thoracic CT angiography was performed to assess management. He was assessed by the congenital heart unit of our hospital, with controlled BP, and was discharged from hospital pending percutaneous intervention. Treatment on discharge: olmesartan-amlodipine 40/5 mg, bisoprolol 2.5 mg, eplerenone 25 mg.  DIAGNOSIS Coarctation of the aorta. Secondary arterial hypertension. Bicuspid aortic valve without dysfunction. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY Patient aged 49 years, no known drug allergies, Romanian nationality. No known family history. Personal history of: Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): ex-smoker since 2014, dyslipidaemic with poor control with statins and overweight. Chronic ischaemic heart disease: acute myocardial infarction (AMI) q inferior in March 2014, fibrinolised with reperfusion criteria. Epistenocardial pericarditis during admission. Coronary angiography 2014: 2-vessel coronary artery disease. Severe right coronary artery (RCA) (artery responsible for AMI): implantation of two drug-eluting stents proximally and distally. Descending anterior descending (DA) with moderate stenosis, no action taken. Echocardiogram at discharge: preserved LVEF, with basal inferior and inferior septal hypokinesia. Isotope stress test at one month after discharge with inferior necrosis. LVEF 47% and the rest of the segments without evidence of ischaemia or contractility alterations. At discharge on treatment with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24 hours, clopidogrel 75 mg/24 hours, bisoprolol 5 mg/24 hours and atorvastatin 80 mg/24 hours.  CURRENT ILLNESS Since discharge he has been monitored in cardiology consultations. He was asymptomatic, in class I, with no recurrence of chest pain or evidence of inducible ischaemia in an isotope stress test performed one month later. He was started on a low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), which he had not tolerated during admission due to hypotension, and clopidogrel was withdrawn after one year without incident. However, from the time of admission, LDL cholesterol levels > 180 mg/dL despite switching to a high-dose high-potency statin (atorvastatin) and elevated levels of lipoprotein A, apoB and homocystinuria were striking. In 2016, he reported myalgias and laboratory tests showed elevated CPK and mild AST and insufficient LDL control, so atorvastatin was replaced by rosuvastatin 20 mg/day and ezetimibe was added. The patient stopped coming for check-ups, until 2018, when he was again referred to our clinic for analytical abnormalities in lipid metabolism. According to the patient, he continues to be asymptomatic from a cardiovascular point of view, reporting only mild myalgias. He is taking medication correctly, including the two lipid-lowering drugs. At this consultation it was decided to study the patient further.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION At consultation in 2018: Blood pressure (BP) 115/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 60 bpm. Baseline SpO2 97%. No jugular venous engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic sounds without murmurs or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation: normal. Abdomen: nondescript. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) (AMI 2014): sinus rhythm at 66 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, normal axis, up to 1.5 mm ST supradelevation in inferior face, V5-V6 with specular image in I, and AVL. ECG in consultation 2018: sinus rhythm at 56 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, lower qR with negative asymmetric T wave in II, III, AVF, and flattened in I, AVL, V5-V6, unchanged from ECG of previous consultation in 2015. Normal QTc. Coronary angiography 2014: 2-vessel coronary artery disease: CD: severe stenosis due to complicated plaque extending from the end of the proximal segment (responsible for AMI). Significant stenosis in the mid-distal segment: percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) + implantation of two non-overlapping drug-eluting stents proximally and distally. AD: moderate stenosis in medial proximal segment, uncomplicated, assessed by intravascular echocardiography (IVUS). Echocardiogram at discharge 2014: left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophied (LVEDDVI 56 mm, IVUS 10 mm, PP 10 mm) with preserved systolic function (LVEF 54%) and inferior septal and basal inferior segment hypokinesia. Mild mitral and aortic regurgitation. Minimal pericardial effusion of 3 mm in posterior sac. Blood tests in AMI 2014: haemogram: Hb 14.2 g/dl; Hct 43.1%; leukocytes 10.9 mil/mm3; platelets 241 mil/mm3. Biochemistry: basal glucose 96 mg/dl; creatinine 0.91 mg/dl; total cholesterol 234 mg/dl; triglycerides 102 mg/dl; HDL-C 30 mg/dl; LDL-C 183.6 mg/dl; APO-B 148 mg/dl. Lipoprotein A 49.4mg/dl, basal homocysteine 16.34 micromol/l, 16.34U/l, AST 24 U/l; ALT 31 U/l; GGT 54 U/l. Maximal myocardial necrosis markers: TnI > 97 ng/ml (0-0.04); CPK 4443 U/l (39-308), CK-MB 510 U/l (5-24). Isotope stress test (one month after discharge): inferior necrosis. LVEF 47%. Rest of segments without evidence of ischaemia or contractility alterations. Blood tests at consultation in January 2016: haemogram: normal. Biochemistry: basal glucose 117 mg/dl; creatinine 1.05 mg/dl; total cholesterol 261 mg/dl; triglycerides 117 mg/dl; HDL-C 47 mg/dl; LDL-C 190.6 mg/dl, AST 63 U/l (0-37); ALT 70 U/l (0-41); GGT 64 U/l (0-60), CPK 507 U/l (39-308). Blood tests in consultation, September 2018: total cholesterol 196 mg/dl; triglycerides 67 mg/dl; HDL-C 42 mg/dl; LDL-C 145 mg/dl, AST 28 U/l (0-37); CPK 305 U/l (39-308). Genetic study of familial hypercholesterolemia: positive. Heterozygosis of the variant c.2478del, p.(Val827Serfs*102), of the LDLR gene, classified as pathogenic with respect to familial hypercholesterolemia. Heterozygosis: rs4149056 polymorphism in the SLCO1B1 gene and rs17244841 of the HMGCR gene. Homozygosis: rs2032582 polymorphism of the ABCB1 gene. Blood tests at consultation after starting iPCSK9 in April 2019: total cholesterol 120 mg/dl; triglycerides 99 mg/dl; HDL-C 49 mg/dl; LDL-C 58 mg/dl.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION This is a smoker, sedentary, obese and dyslipidaemic patient on treatment with simvastatin with LDL who debuted in 2014 with a lower AMI. On admission, LDL levels > 180 mg/dl were found despite a change to a high-dose high-potency statin since the event. In the first consultations after the coronary event, the patient had not presented chest pain again, and isotope exercise stress test showed no inducible ischaemia in the anterior descending artery territory, so percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was not performed on this lesion. On anamnesis, he reported weakness and myalgia in the extremities, in addition to a discrete elevation of AST and CPK, for which reason intolerance to atorvastatin was assumed, so it was replaced by rosuvastatin 20 mg/day and ezetimibe was added to optimise LDL control. In 2016, he stopped coming for check-ups, until 2018, when he was again referred to our offices for analytical alterations in lipid metabolism. According to him, he remains asymptomatic from a cardiovascular point of view. He was taking medication correctly, including the two lipid-lowering drugs, but his LDL levels were still around 150 mg/dl. At this consultation, it was decided to further study the patient and request genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia, which was positive. For this reason, treatment was finally started with a PCSK9 inhibitor, evolocumab at a dose of 140 mg every 2 weeks, achieving a greater than 50% decrease with respect to the previous LDL figures with combined treatment.

Hilar thickening of vascular origin. No signs of consolidation or pleural effusion. Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT with IV contrast: no evidence of distant disease, but calcified coronary atheromatosis of the three vessels and mild aortic valve calcification. Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle of normal diameters, with slight concentric hypertrophy (IVT 11 mm, PP 11 mm) and with good systolic function (LVEF 60%), without alterations in segmental contractility. Non-dilated right ventricle with good systolic function (TAPSE 20 mm). Type I diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation). E/e' 4. Left atrium slightly dilated (41 mm). Aortic root not dilated. Trivalve aortic valve with normal gradient and no insufficiency. Normal appearing mitral valve with minimal insufficiency. Absence of tricuspid insufficiency that would allow estimation of PAPS. Conclusion: mild hypertensive heart disease with good biventricular systolic function. Electrocardiographic stress test: maximal stress test (104% of predicted FCM) performed with Bruce protocol on treadmill, stopped due to physical exhaustion. Abnormal for maximum ST-segment depression of 1.5 mm horizontal in 5 leads (II, III, aVF and V5-V6) in the recovery phase that normalises after 5 minutes, without clinical chest pain. Adequate chronotropic response and adaptation of BP to effort. Good functional capacity: reaches 11.2 METS, exercise time of 9 min 35 sec. No arrhythmias detected during the test.

Anterior descending artery (ADA): severe stenosis in proximal and middle segment, and significant stenosis in distal middle segment. First diagonal of good calibre with early bifurcation and severe stenosis in proximal segment with distal vessel of intermediate calibre. Circumflex artery (ACx): Non-dominant, without significant lesions. Right coronary artery (RCA): dominant, highly developed, without lesions. Percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting balloon angioplasty on the first diagonal and implantation of two overlapping stents (BioFreedom) in the proximal and middle RCA, recommending 6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy, although with the possibility of suspending it one month after the procedure. Blood tests (May 2019): Glucose 99 mg/dl. Renal function preserved (creatinine 0.87 mg/dl) with electrolytes in range. Urine sediment and urine electrolytes without alterations. Lipid profile: triglycerides 55 mg/dl, cholesterol 93 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 48 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 34 mg/dl. Transaminases and cholestasis enzymes in range. CPK not elevated (139 U/l). Haemogram and coagulation without alterations.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After discussing the different diagnostic and therapeutic options with the patient, it was decided on the first visit to request an echocardiography, paying special attention to ventricular function, and an electrocardiographic stress test for diagnostic (to assess the presence of silent ischaemia) and prognostic purposes. It was also decided at that time to add to the treatment acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/day, atorvastatin 40 mg/day (the patient is considered to have established cardiovascular disease due to the presence of coronary calcification and therefore his LDL target is less than 70 mg/dl), bisoprolol 5 mg/day (initially at half dose, instructing to start depending on the heart rate at home) and omeprazole 20 mg/day. Echocardiography showed preserved left ventricular function (LVEF 60%) with no alterations in segmental contractility. On the other hand, in the stress test the patient presented electrocardiogram (ECG) changes suggestive of myocardial ischaemia, although at high load, without clinical chest pain and reaching 11.2 METS, so it is considered a low-risk exercise test with a good prognosis. After reviewing the information provided by the complementary tests and again discussing the management options with the patient, it was decided, due to the presence of coronary calcification and the ischaemia data in the treadmill test, to request a coronary angiography, with special emphasis on the need for surgery in the short-medium term due to prostate adenocarcinoma, with respect to the need for percutaneous revascularisation and subsequent double antiplatelet therapy. Coronary angiography showed severe stenosis in the proximal and middle LAD and in the first diagonal branch, treated with implantation of two overlapping drug-eluting stents in the proximal and middle LAD and drug-eluting balloon angioplasty in the diagonal branch. Biofreedom stents were selected, allowing, if deemed necessary, interruption of the double antiplatelet therapy one month after implantation, to allow, in this case, to perform the surgery required by the prostatic pathology without increasing either the risk of stent thrombosis or bleeding in the perioperative period. Treatment was therefore started with clopidogrel 75 mg/day. The patient's subsequent evolution has been good. There were no complications arising from the procedure and he has remained asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view. He has an excellent control of cardiovascular risk factors after treatment adjustment, being within the LDL targets (which went from 107 to 34 mg/dl). He is currently awaiting the end of a month of double antiplatelet therapy with ASA + clopidogrel, and then only simple antiplatelet therapy with ASA and radical prostatectomy.   DIAGNOSIS Asymptomatic coronary artery disease with evidence of silent ischaemia. Single vessel disease: severe stenosis in proximal and middle LAD and first diagonal branch. Percutaneous revascularisation: drug-eluting balloon angioplasty in diagonal branch and implantation of two drug-eluting stents. BioFreedom in proximal and mid LAD. Dyslipidaemia. Arterial hypertension. Prostate adenocarcinoma. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Family history of ischaemic heart disease in his father at 78 years of age. Usual treatment: losartan 50 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), simvastatin 40 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours).  CURRENT DISEASE The patient is a 47-year-old man, with the previously described personal history, who one summer morning, while working in his field, presented with an episode of central thoracic pain, with oppressive characteristics, radiating to the throat, accompanied by cold sweating and nausea without vomiting. There were no symptoms of dyspnoea or palpitations. The patient leads an active life. He had never before presented episodes similar to the one that prompted the consultation. No intercurrent infectious conditions or fever. No clinical signs of heart failure. He was attended by the emergency services who found the patient haemodynamically stable with blood pressure (BP) 135/85 mmHG, heart rate (HR) 84 bpm, conscious, oriented and cooperative. An ECG was performed on arrival documenting ST-segment elevation of 2 mm in the inferior aspect and V6, and the patient was transferred urgently to our hospital. The pain subsided during the transfer with sublingual nitroglycerine. On arrival at the emergency department of our hospital, the patient was asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view. A new ECG was performed showing normalisation of the electrical changes (no ST segment elevation). The patient was monitored and on-call cardiology was contacted for urgent assessment. Given that the patient remained clinically and haemodynamically stable, with no changes suggestive of ischaemia on the electrocardiogram and with normal bedside echocardioscopy (Vscan), it was decided not to activate the infarction code, and the patient was classified as non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) due to transient ST-segment elevation.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION When assessed by cardiology, the patient was asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view, with no new episodes of chest pain or any other anginal symptoms. Haemodynamically stable with BP 125/76 mmHg, HR 79 bpm. Eupneic at rest and speech, without supplementary oxygen therapy. Tolerating decubitus at 0 ̊. Afebrile.

Ectatic right coronary artery (RCA) with severe stenosis (90%) in its middle segment treated by implantation of a direct drug-eluting stent (Synergy 4 x 38 mm) and post-dilatation with non-compliant balloon (4.5 x 20 mm). Mild atheromatosis of the anterior descending artery (ADA) and circumflex artery (ACx).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the cardiology intermediate care unit. During his stay in the unit, his evolution was favourable; he remained haemodynamically stable at all times, with no new episodes of chest pain or electrical changes. Continuous monitoring did not detect any arrhythmic events. Coronary angiography was performed 36 hours after admission to the unit, revealing a significant lesion in the middle segment of the RCA, which was revascularised by implanting a drug-eluting stent and post-dilatation with a balloon. The procedure passed without complications. Medical treatment was adjusted during admission, insisting on secondary prevention measures for ischaemic heart disease and, above all, smoking cessation. On discharge he was referred to the cardiac rehabilitation unit, with the following treatment: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), ticagrelor 90 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), atorvastatin 80 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), losartan 50 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), bisoprolol 5 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), omeprazole 20 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), sublingual nitroglycerin if chest pain.  DIAGNOSIS NSTEACS type transient ST-elevation secondary to severe mid RCA lesion revascularised by 1 drug-eluting stent. Preserved ventricular function. Hypertension and dyslipidaemia.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY Independent in basic and instrumental activities of daily living. Active life. Works in the countryside. Toxic habits: active smoker of 1 pack a day (20 cigarettes/day) since the age of 17. No history of hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidaemia. No history of cardiovascular disease. Other medical history: chronic pharyngitis, herniated disc at C5-C6 and C7-D1. No previous surgical interventions. No medical treatment at present.  CURRENT ILLNESS She initially consulted the emergency department of our hospital for symptoms consisting of diffuse abdominal pain, persistent nausea and vomiting despite home treatment. As associated symptomatology, she reported a non-thermometric dysthermic sensation of months of evolution together with associated diaphoresis, predominantly at night. The complementary tests performed were suggestive of acute pancreatitis (increased amylase in blood and urine), so a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast showed findings compatible with mild pancreatitis. At the same time, the images obtained at the lower thoracic level showed a hypodense image with well-defined borders located in the left atrium dependent on the interatrial septum compatible with an intracardiac mass, and atrial myxoma was considered the first possibility.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute. No pathological increase in voltage or P wave duration. 160 msec PR interval. Narrow QRS of 80 msec duration, with axis at -30o, with morphology of incomplete right bundle branch block. No pathological alterations of repolarisation were observed. QTc of 404 msec. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis: slight enlargement of the pancreatic head and uncinate process with infiltration of the adjacent fat, without evidence of collections, suggestive of mild acute pancreatitis. Hepatic steatosis, with several simple cysts. Aliased gallbladder, without intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct dilatation. Spleen without pathological alterations. No intra-abdominal free fluid is seen. Hypodense mass inside the left atrium of about 4 cm. This lesion has well-defined borders, spherical morphology, with a calcific point inside and a pedicle that depends on the interatrial septum. The mass prolapses towards the left ventricle, as can be seen in successive slices. Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic (LVED 50 mm; IVS 10 mm; PP 10 mm) with preserved global systolic function (LVEF 59% by Simpson). No segmental alterations of contractility were observed. Aortic root not dilated. Trivalve aortic valve with mild degenerative involvement. Dilated left atrium (volume 81 cm3), showing a pedunculated mass with well-defined borders anchored at the level of the fossa ovalis, measuring 50 x 26 mm, which prolapses towards the ventricle in diastole, dragging the anterior mitral leaflet. These findings suggest left atrial myxoma as the first diagnostic option. Non-dilated right chambers, with a normofunctioning right ventricle (TAPSE 25 mm). Doppler study with normal transmitral flows (Vel. E 1.09 m/s; Vel A 0.9 m/s), without pathological increase in pressure gradients (mean gradient 3 mmHg). Mitral insufficiency grade II with jet projected towards the lateral wall of the left atrium. Aortic valve with normal antegrade flows (max. velocity 1.15 m/s), with no evidence of valvular insufficiency. Coronary angiography: left dominance, without lesions in coronary arteries. Pathological anatomy of the resected mass: nodular formation of 26 g and 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm in size. Smooth, shiny and brownish surface. Serial sections show a heterogeneous surface with blackish and other irregular whitish areas, including some cystic areas histologically compatible with atrial myxoma with large areas of haemorrhage and thrombosis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION When atrial myxoma was suspected in the CT scan, studies were completed with transthoracic echocardiography and coronary angiography. With the presumptive diagnosis of left atrial myxoma, the case was discussed with cardiovascular surgery, who advised deferring surgery until the pancreatic symptoms were controlled. During the first few days of admission, the patient remained stable from a clinical and haemodynamic point of view. There was a progressive improvement in the abdominal symptoms, which allowed for the reintroduction of an oral diet, without incident. A new abdominal CT scan was performed, which ruled out late complications derived from the pancreatic symptoms. In view of the evolutionary course, surgery was performed on the 14th day of admission. Opening was performed by conventional median sternotomy and, accessing through the right atriotomy, the left atrial mass was resected along with its pedicle, closing the residual septal defect by direct suture. Pathological anatomy confirms the diagnosis of atrial myxoma, with extensive areas of haemorrhage and thrombosis. The evolution after surgery was long and torpid. His stay in the post-surgical unit was marked by the appearance of supraventricular tachycardia at 130 bpm compatible with atrial flutter, with recurrent behaviour despite several attempts at electrical cardioversion, some of which caused the tachyarrhythmia to temporarily degenerate into atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control was attempted with antiarrhythmic treatment (amiodarone), but had to be discontinued due to the appearance of complete atrioventricular block. Optimal ventricular rate control is also not achieved by adding beta-blockers to the treatment. Given that the ventricular response to the arrhythmia was well tolerated by the patient, it was decided to discharge the patient to the cardiology ward to optimise treatment. The situation was discussed with the arrhythmology department and an electrophysiological study was scheduled, which revealed counterclockwise atrial flutter, and successful ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus was performed. After completing the procedure, together with the cessation of the arrhythmia, loss of sinus leakage above 40 bpm was observed. This situation required the placement of a transient pacing device and the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (DDDR) was programmed. After implantation, the patient evolved satisfactorily and was discharged a few days after implantation.  DIAGNOSIS Left atrial myxoma. Mild acute pancreatitis (RANSON 0). Counterclockwise isthmic atrial flutter with successful ablation. Transient atrial fibrillation in immediate postoperative period CHA2DS2-VASc 1; HAS-BLED 1. Sinus dysfunction with need for DDDR permanent pacemaker implantation, in sinus rhythm at discharge. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 4-year-old female patient, under follow-up by her paediatrician, who was found to have a systolic murmur at the last check-up. She had no relevant history (normal vaginal delivery) and no incidents in previous examinations. The parents were asked about unusual signs/symptoms in recent months. Although there was no limitation in terms of exercise ("she plays in the park with the other children"), in the last few months they noticed that she was more tired. They also report that "when she runs she sometimes stops because of coughing fits". No sweating and/or noticeable tachypnoea in the context of meals. Adequate nutrition, with a good natural weight curve. Good night's rest. No dizziness or loss of consciousness. No complaints of chest pain. Inquiries were made about a history of heart disease in the family, which the parents denied. At the consultation, the child was in an acceptable general state. Skin and mucous membranes were well coloured, weight and height P75. Weight and height in P75. Blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, with no differences between members of the family. Saturation of 100% without oxygen therapy. On auscultation, systolic murmur III/VI predominantly in mitral focus with irradiation to the axilla. No crackles or other noises added to the pulmonary auscultation. Abdomen soft and depressible, without hepatomegaly or hepatalgia. Lower limbs with good distal perfusion and preserved and symmetrical pulses. The patient was referred to the local cardiology department.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: renal function preserved (creatinine 0.6 mg/dl) with ions in range. Liver profile without alterations. NT-proBNP 600 pg/l. CBC 98. Haemogram anodyne, with white and red series and platelets in range. Coagulation without findings. Chest X-ray: increased cardiothoracic index. SCF free. No condensation or any other noticeable congestion. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 100 bpm. Normal axis. Normal PR. Narrow QRS with anterolateral Q wave. ST elevation in precordial leads. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): situs solitus. Atrioventricular (AV) concordance. Normal venous drainage. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with adequate respiratory variations. No effusion. Dilated left atrium (LA). Dilated left ventricle (LV) with systolic function at lower limits (LVEF by Simpson and Teich of 50%). Moderate-severe mitral insufficiency (MI) with anterior leaflet prolapse. Hyperechogenic anterior subvalvular apparatus, suggestive of fibrosis. Trivalve aortic valve with good opening and no aortic insufficiency (AIo). The large vessel view shows dilatation of the ostium of the right coronary artery (RCA), with a proximal course of the artery of good calibre. The LMCA ostium is absent, with proximal fine calibre/hypoplastic anterior descending artery (ADA) and circumflex artery (ACx). Retrograde flow in left branches by colour Doppler. No communication with the pulmonary artery is visualised. Right ventricle (RV) not dilated with preserved systolic function. Trivial tricuspid insufficiency (TI) jet with no entity gradient to estimate pulmonary pressures. Angiographic study: procedure performed under general anaesthesia. Right femoral access. Contrast injection is performed and anterograde filling of the RCA is observed, which is dominant. The left coronary tree is not filled at first. Late and retrograde filling of the left tree, from collateral branches provided by the right tree. ACx and ADA converge proximally in a blind cul-de-sac, with no connection to the IVC, which is absent. Conclusion: diagnosis of congenital atresia of the LMCA.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was assessed in cardiology, where the anamnesis was similar to that carried out in her health centre. An ECG was initially performed which was clearly pathological (see complementary tests). Transthoracic echocardiography showed, as the most significant finding, mitral regurgitation of entity by colour Doppler. The fibrosis of the subvalvular apparatus is striking. The left ventricle is dilated but systolic function is preserved. A search for the origin of the coronary arteries was performed in the ECP (large vessel plane), and the origin of the dilated RCA was found, without visualising the origin of the LMCA. Given these findings, the patient was referred to a tertiary referral hospital. Aortography was scheduled by the haemodynamics team and the procedure was performed under general anaesthesia. On injecting the contrast agent, the ACD was found to be filled in an anterograde manner, with an initial absence of filling of the left aortic tree. Late retrograde filling of left branches from the RCA, which provides collateral circulation. Poor tolerance to the procedure, with arterial hypotension and bradycardia requiring vasoactive/inothropic support. Urgent echocardiography showed acute left ventricular dysfunction, requiring mechanical circulatory support. Haemodynamic and echocardiographic improvement in the first 30 minutes, with subsequent transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and stabilisation. The patient remained in the ICU for 15 days with progressive clinical improvement. After stabilisation, the patient was proposed and accepted for revascularisation surgery. A coronary CT scan was requested beforehand for better pre-surgical characterisation of the anatomy.  DIAGNOSIS Congenital atresia of the left main coronary artery. Severe ischaemic mitral regurgitation in this context. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY No known drug allergies. No toxic habits. Cardiovascular risk factors: regularly controlled hypertension. No known dyslipidaemia or diabetes. Overweight. No medical or surgical history of interest. Usual treatment: losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg 1 tablet every 24 hours.  CURRENT ILLNESS A 53-year-old man with hypertension of approximately two years of evolution with poor control at home, who consulted the emergency department for clinical pain described as shooting/oppressive in the interscapular region radiating towards the anterior region of the thorax and internal face of the left upper limb on moderate/high intensity exertion, gradually subsiding with rest, for the last 2 weeks. He also reported a slight sensation of dyspnoea, without palpitations or vegetative cortex, and denied previous similar episodes. After performing complementary tests in the emergency department (detailed below), it was decided to monitor her for the first 24 hours in the observation area, with no new events.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. Collaborative. Well hydrated and perfused. Afebrile. Haemodynamically stable with blood pressure 132/87 mmHg (on arrival at the ED 200/112 mmHg) and heart rate 70 bpm. Eupneic at rest and when speaking, tolerating full decubitus and with no need for supplementary oxygen therapy. On auscultation, rhythmic heart tones without audible murmurs. Bladder murmur was preserved without crackles or other pathological noises. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). No other noteworthy findings on examination.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on admission: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Normal axis. PR 160 msec. Narrow QRS with little R wave progression in right precordial leads. Symmetrical and deep negative T waves from V1 to V4 and isodiphasic in V5 (Wellens pattern). ECG after percutaneous coronary intervention: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm. Normal axis. Normal PR. Narrow QRS with little progression of R in right precordials and normalisation of T waves in precordial series. Blood tests: glycaemia 102 mg/dl. Creatinine 1.24 mg/dl. Urea 36 mg/dl. Sodium 143 mEq/l. Potassium 4.3 mEq/l. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 206 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 43 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 133 mg/dl, triglycerides 148 mg/dl. Normal liver and thyroid profiles. Glycated haemoglobin 5.9%. Myocardial damage markers with ultrasensitive cTnT peak of 121.8 ng/l. Haemogram without leukocytosis with normal formula. Hb 150 g/l. Platelets 229,000. Normal coagulation study. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. Well-defined hilarity, no evidence of pulmonary congestion or parenchymal condensation. Free costophrenic sinuses. Transthoracic echocardiography: non-dilated left ventricle (LVEDD 45 mm, LVOT 148 ml, STV 54 ml) with 12.5 mm mid-basal septum, with largely preserved systolic function (LVEF 63 % by Simpson biplane). No segmental contractility defects are seen. Left atrium at the high limit of normality (AP diameter 36 mm, indexed volume 30 ml/m2). Normal mitral valve. Mitral E wave velocity 5 cm/sec, A wave 61 cm/sec. Septal E" 7.7, lateral E" 8.8, E/E" 7.6. Trivalve aortic valve with normal flows. Aortic root not dilated (sinuses of Valsalva 38 mm). Right chambers not dilated, without tricuspid insufficiency that would allow estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs) (no indirect data of PHT). Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated. Absence of pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography: right radial access. Left main coronary artery without lesions. Anterior descending artery with proximal subtotal lesion with good distal vessel. Dominant circumflex artery without lesions. Hypodense right coronary artery without lesions. Direct implantation of a zotarolimus-eluting stent (Resolute Onyx 3.5 x 18 mm) was performed on the proximal anterior descending artery (ADA), without immediate complications and with good final angiographic results.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his hospital stay, the patient presented an episode of chest pain with a typical profile for ischaemia without associated vegetative cortex, during which minimal ST-segment elevation was observed in the anterior face, which subsided after the administration of nitrates, while the T-wave inversion described prior to admission persisted. Serial analytical controls showed discrete mobilisation of biomarkers of myocardial damage (peak TnTus 121.8 ng/l). Based on clinical symptoms compatible with recent-onset angina and the findings described, preferential coronary angiography was requested, which revealed a subtotal lesion at the proximal level of the anterior descending artery, with no other associated coronary lesions. This lesion was percutaneously revascularised and a drug-eluting stent was implanted without incident and with good angiographic results. At the end of the procedure, a new electrocardiogram was performed which showed normalisation of the repolarisation disorders described on admission. With regard to the imaging tests, the echocardiography showed a ventricle of normal size and morphology with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF 63%), without identifying segmental alterations in contractility. After the coronary intervention, the patient remained completely asymptomatic and without complications derived from the procedure and was discharged. He is currently undergoing a cardiac rehabilitation programme at our centre, with good tolerance to the exercises performed at the gym, remaining asymptomatic and with no notable clinical incidents.  DIAGNOSIS Acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with single-vessel coronary artery disease (subtotal lesion of the proximal LAD). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with direct drug-eluting stent (DES) without incident. Initial electrical manifestation with Wellens pattern. Poorly controlled hypertension. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The clinic was present for approximately 45 minutes.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 131/72 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 74 bpm. Baseline O2 saturation (SatO2) 100%. Afebrile. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Eupneic at rest. Good general condition, normohydrated and normal colour. Rhythmic carotids without murmurs, no jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation (CA): rhythmic without audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation (PA): with preserved vesicular murmur without over-additions. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, without masses or megaliths. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of phlebitis. Radial, femoral and anterior tibial pulses preserved and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYSIS: haemoglobin 11.9 g/dl, platelets 268,000/mm3, leukocytes 6,790/mm3 (with normal formula). Coagulation normal. Glucose 91 mg/dl, urea 56 mg/dl, creatinine 1.09 mg/dl, CKDEPI 46 ml/min, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium 4.9 mEq/l, triglycerides 121 mg/dl, total cholesterol 184 mg/dl (HDL 42 mg/dl, LDL 118 mg/dl), uric acid 7,0 mg/dl, ALT 42 IU/l, AST 262 IU/l, GGT 22 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 98 IU/l, total bilirubin 0.3 mg/dl, iron 42 ug/dl, transferrin 2.12 mg/dl, IST 15.6%, ferritin 52.3 ng/ml, TSH 1.33 ng/dl, HbA1c 5.8%. Troponin I 0.87 ng/ml on admission, peak 126 ng/ml (high limit of normal 0.08 ng/ml). AP THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: slight elongation of the aorta, right costophrenic sinus impingement, fluid in the right major fissure. Cardiovascular silhouette poorly assessable by technique. ECG (admission): sinus rhythm at 70 bpm with normal PR and narrow QRS, ST segment rectification on the lateral side. ECG (coronary unit): sinus rhythm at 75 bpm, normal PR, subepicardial lesion wave with lateral negative T. ECOCARDIOGRAM: regular echocardiographic window. LV of normal size and global systolic function, with hypokinesia of the posterior face. Dilated left atrium with area 28.3 cm2. Right chambers of normal size. Calcification of the mitral annulus. No significant insufficiency detected. Normal tricuspid with moderate insufficiency. RV-AD systolic gradient 34 mmHg. Normal inferior vena cava. Normal aortic with mild-trivial insufficiency, without pathological gradient. CARDIAC CATHETERISM: coronary arteries without lesions except for a filling defect in the first obtuse marginal. Aspiration of whitish material was performed with two fragments of 1 cm each, which were sent to pathological anatomy for study. After extraction, the artery was left with TIMI 3 flow. PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY: calcified, acellular material with atheroembolic morphology.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION With the diagnosis of NSTEACS, the patient was admitted to the coronary unit and remained asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view throughout her admission. Early catheterisation showed coronary occlusion of embolic aetiology, without being able to establish the source of atheroembolism, so given that she did not present a high risk of haemorrhage, anticoagulation was started empirically. Blood pressure and heart rate were controlled during admission, with no arrhythmias observed. The patient was discharged three days after admission.  DIAGNOSIS Ischaemic heart disease. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) non-Q, Killip I. Repletion defect in obtuse marginal artery of embolic aetiology. Coronary arteries without lesions. Preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 67-year-old male under follow-up with cardiology consultation.  BACKGROUND: Allergy to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Coronary ischaemic heart disease with single-vessel disease: percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and drug-eluting stent implantation in the middle anterior descending artery (AD). Normal LV function. Arterial hypertension (AHT). Stage III chronic renal failure. Deep vein thrombosis with factor V Leiden mutation (Arg506Gln). Bicameral pacing due to complete atrioventricular block (AVB) (2015). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Home treatment: clopidogrel 75, esomeprazole 20 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg 1-0-0, losartan 50 mg 1-0-0, acenocoumarol, simvastatin 40 mg 0-0-1, tamsulosin.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Patient under outpatient follow-up for single-vessel coronary artery disease and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who came for cardiology consultation one year after the event. He reported not having angina, but with asthenia and dyspnoea on moderate exertion.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 130/70 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 54 bpm. Weight 66 bpm. Height 175 cm. Abdominal circumference 85 cm. Rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen without palpable masses. No oedema in the lower limbs. Pedial pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS: haemoglobin 13.8 g/dl, platelets 200,000, creatinine 3.2 mg/dl, MDRD-4 20 ml/min/sup, sodium 140 meq/l, potassium 5.1 mel/l, GOT 9 U/L, GPT 15 U/l. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 244 mg/dl, 251 mg/dl, HDL 31 mg/dl, LDL 162 mg/dl. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm with ventricular stimulation. ECOCARDIOGRAPHY: non-dilated left ventricle with preserved global systolic function, without segmental contractility disorders. ANALYSIS (after starting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors: total cholesterol 108 mg/dl, HDL 46 mg/dl, LDL 45 mg/dl.  CLINICAL COURSE In the annual follow-up assessment, a stress echocardiogram was requested due to the patient's dyspnoea on exertion. In the lipid profile, high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were detected, so lipid-lowering treatment was intensified, replacing simvastatin 40 with rosuvastatin 10 mg. The patient returned to the clinic with the results of the stress echocardiogram, which was negative for ischaemia (85% of BMF; 7 metabolic equivalents (MET); no data of ischaemia in echocardiography). The patient also reported muscle discomfort since the last visit and decided to discontinue treatment with rosuvastatin. For this reason, a new lipid profile was requested and pitavastatin 2 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg were prescribed. At the same time, the patient's beta-blocker dose was reduced, in case the feeling of asthenia could be related to this (bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 hours). The patient returned for consultation 3 months later, reporting the same symptoms and that he could not tolerate the new statin. The blood test did not detect any liver alteration or muscle damage (GOT/GPT 19/18 U/L), but due to the patient's poor tolerance with up to three different statins, it was proposed to start treatment with evolocumab. Evolocumab 140 mg/2 weeks was started, with good tolerance. In the analytical control 2 months after starting treatment, a lipid control was requested with LDL 45 mg/dl. After one year of follow-up, and due to the need for oral anticoagulation, it was decided to discontinue clopidogrel and maintain acenocoumarol, in order to reduce the risk of haemorrhage.  DIAGNOSIS Single-vessel coronary artery disease. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Intolerance to statins, with very high cardiovascular risk. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 72-year-old man attended the emergency department for an episode of sudden dyspnoea. Personal history of interest: ischaemic cerebrovascular accident in 2009 with an unidentified aetiology (echo-Doppler of supra-aortic trunks with no pathological findings), infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung operated on with right upper lobectomy 5 months ago. He was under chronic treatment with acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg/24 hours and inhaled salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/500 mcg/12 hours. He reported several episodes of dyspnoea over the last month, always standing upright, unrelated to exertion. No orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. No cough, expectoration or chest pain. Physical examination revealed oxygen desaturation up to 80%, which improved with decubitus. Jugular venous pressure was normal. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic, without murmurs or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation with hypophonesis in the right lung base, absence of crackles or rhonchi. Absence of oedema in the extremities.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYSIS: glucose 80 mg/dl, urea 50 mg/dl, creatinine 0.85 mg/dl, sodium 136 mEq/l, potassium 4.1 mEq/l, troponin I < 0.01 ng/ml, BNP 102.6 pg/ml, haemoglobin 16.1 g/dl, haematocrit 50.8%, MCV 96.8 fl, leukocytes 9,100, platelets 111,000, D-dimer 2,005 ng/l. Coagulation normal. ARTERIAL GASOMETRY: pH 7,43, pCO2 26,5 mmHg, p02 100,3 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SatO2) 98,7%, bicarbonate 17,5 mEq/l. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 95 bpm. PR 200 ms, QRS of 100 ms, with morphology of left anterosuperior hemiblock. No repolarisation alterations. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Normal cardiac silhouette. THORACIC CT scan: loss of volume in the right upper lobe in relation to lobectomy. Residual middle lobe atelectasis and elevated right hemidiaphragm. No repletion defects in pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal dimensions and systolic function, without segmental alterations of contractility. Normal right chambers with preserved ventricular function. Mitral and aortic valves without abnormalities. Hypermobile interatrial septum. Normal pulmonary pressure. Bubble test was performed with agitated saline with massive passage of bubbles from right to left cavities in the first and second beats suggesting right-left shunt. Transesophageal echocardiogram: aneurysmal interatrial septum with extensive detachment of the membrane of the fossa ovalis and massive passage of bubbles with agitated physiological saline from the right to the left atrium.  CLINICAL COURSE Initially the patient responded to oxygen therapy with nasal goggles and was admitted to the ward for investigation. A thoracic CT scan was first performed to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) or a complication of the recent lobectomy. In the absence of pulmonary pathology to justify the symptoms, an echocardiogram was requested to rule out intracardiac shunt. The baseline study showed a hypermobile interatrial septum with possible shunt, which was evident in the bubble test with agitated saline. The study was completed with a transesophageal echocardiogram that confirmed the presence of an atrial septal aneurysm with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and left right shunt. The patient presented rapidly progressive worsening, with severe sustained hypoxaemia (SatO2 65%) that was not corrected with position or oxygen therapy. In view of this situation, urgent percutaneous closure of the PFO was decided under intracardiac echo monitoring. After PFO closure, oxygen saturation normalised and dyspnoea disappeared.  DIAGNOSIS Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome due to patent foramen ovale after right lobectomy. Urgent percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: portable, AP projection. Normal cardiothoracic index, without costophrenic sinus pinching or vascular redistribution data. No pneumonic condensation. TELEMETRY during admission: sinus rhythm without arrhythmic events. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): left atrium (LA) moderately dilated. Left ventricle (LV) not dilated, with moderate hypertrophy and preserved LVEF. No segmental alterations. Prolonged LV relaxation. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size and function. Fibrosed mitral valve, not stenotic. Mild mitral insufficiency. Calcified aortic valve, mobile, with mild aortic stenosis by gradient, moderate by estimated area. Mild tricuspid insufficiency. PSAP 32 mmHg + PVC. CORONARYGRAPHY: left coronary trunk: no stenosis. Proximal LAD with 80% stenosis in the context of in-stent restenosis, TIMI grade 3 flow with good distal bed. Mid LAD with 70% stenosis, TIMI grade 3 flow with good distal bed. Distal DA with 70% stenosis and TIMI grade 3 flow. Distal circumflex artery (Cx) has 60% stenosis, TIMI grade 3 flow and good distal bed. Right coronary artery: no stenosis. PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) on the LAD: Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is performed on in-stent restenosis in the proximal LAD, with predilatation and subsequent implantation of a 3 x 20 mm everolimus-eluting stent. Another 3 x 12 mm everolimus-eluting stent is overlapped distally in the middle third stenosis. We finished by implanting another 2.5 x 12 mm everolimus-eluting stent over the distal LAD stenosis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the hospital ward as non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) of the non-Q acute myocardial infarction (AMI) type in a stable haemodynamic situation (Killip Kimball [KK] I). Given the aortic murmur and the history of mild aortic valve disease, echocardiography was performed to confirm that there was no severe stenosis and to assess LV systolic function. TTE reveals mildly moderate aortic stenosis with preserved LVEF. Given a high-risk ACS, coronary angiography was performed in the first 24 hours, revealing severe in-stent restenosis in the proximal LAD and severe lesions in the mid and distal LAD with moderate lesions in the distal Cx. In the same procedure, PCI was performed on the LAD with implantation of three overlapping drug-eluting stents from proximal to distal. The patient evolved favourably without complications. As for his CVRF, it seems clear that LDL cholesterol is off target and we will increase his statin; but will this be enough? And regarding his type 2 DM, he is well controlled with metformin (HbA1c 6.5%). So, do I maintain his treatment or should I take advantage of this moment to do something else?  DIAGNOSIS Ischaemic heart disease. NSTEACS non-Q AMI. KKI. 2-vessel coronary artery disease: Severe proximal LAD with in-stent restenosis and severe mid and distal LAD; moderate distal Cx.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Male, 41 years old, no drug allergies.  BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): dyslipidaemia. Ex-smoker of 20 cigarettes/day. Sporadic cocaine and alcohol user. Left frontoparietal ischaemic stroke in the context of cocaine use (2009). Complementary studies performed (electrocardiogram [ECG] monitoring, Doppler of supra-aortic trunks, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with bubble test, study of coagulopathy) compatible with normality. No sequelae at present. No personal or family cardiological history. Usual treatment: acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg/day, simvastatin 20 mg/day.  CURRENT ILLNESS: She attended the emergency department for neurological focality consisting of motor aphasia and dysarthria of onset 30 minutes ago. A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed showing a known left frontoparietal lesion, with no acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic findings. The on-call neurology department was contacted and, given a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of less than 4 (not very disabling symptoms), he was not considered a candidate for reperfusion treatment. He was admitted to the stroke unit for haemodynamic control, evolution and study.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 130/70 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 65 bpm. Oxygen saturation (SatO2) 96% (with room air). Afebrile. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normoventilation. Abdomen nondescript. Lower extremities without oedema or indirect signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pedial pulses present and symmetrical. Neurological examination: normoreactive isochoric pupils. Normal cranial nerves. Motor aphasia with mild dysarthria. Strength and sensitivity preserved and symmetrical. No campimetric alterations, dysmetria or gait disturbances.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm, without conduction disorders, without repolarisation alterations. CHEST X-RAY: cardiothoracic index within the normal range, lung fields without condensation. ANALYSIS: Biochemistry: glucose 90 mg/dl, urea 24 mg/dl, creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, chlorine 99 mEq/l, sodium 141 mEq/l, potassium 4.5 mEq/l. Thyroid function, vitamin B12 and folic acid normal. Haemogram: leucocytes 10,100, Hb 16.4 g/dl, Ht 47.8%, platelets 260,000. Serology: negative. Urine toxins: negative. TROMBOPHILY STUDY: heterozygous for C677T polymorphism, normal for factor V Leyden and prothrombin G20210A mutations. TTE: left ventricle (LV) not dilated or hypertrophic, normal global and segmental systolic function. Left atrium slightly dilated. Right chambers normal, right ventricular (RV) contractility normal. Mitral valve: on the free edge of the anterior mitral leaflet there is a nodular, homogeneous image, which does not interfere with valve kinetics. Aortic valve: trivalve, thin leaflets, competent. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI). Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with preserved inspiratory collapse. Normal systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPS). Absence of pericardial effusion. CARDIAC NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MRI): nodular image of about 7 mm attached to the septal leaflet of the mitral valve, poorly defined, which could correspond to fibroelastoma. Late enhancement sequences show no foci of uptake indicating areas of myocardial necrosis or fibrosis. Given the suspicion, transesophageal echocardiography is recommended. Transesophageal echocardiogram: Atrial septum intact. Left atrial septum free of thrombus. Mitral valve: thin leaflets, mobility and opening preserved. On the atrial side of the anterior mitral leaflet (festoon A1-A2) there is an oval mass, heterogeneous in appearance, sessile, without interfering with valve function, suggesting papillary fibroelastoma as a first diagnostic possibility. The rest of the study is superimposable on the transthoracic study. CARDIAC CATHETERISM: coronary angiography: right dominance. Left coronary artery (LMCA): good calibre, without lesions. Descending anterior descending artery (DA): no stenosis, intramyocardial middle segment with slight associated milking. Circumflex (Cx): moderate development, no lesions. Bisector: long and of good calibre, without stenosis. CD: no stenosis. Aortography: ascending aorta of normal size, trivalve aortic valve, normofunctioning.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his stay on the ward, progressive improvement with complete resolution of the neurological symptoms within 24 hours. No arrhythmic events were observed on ECG monitoring. The echocardiographic study showed a mass in the anterior mitral leaflet suggesting papillary fibroelastoma as the underlying aetiological process of the vascular event presented by the patient. Given the risk of potential embolic complications, it was decided to complete the study on an outpatient basis and to consider tumour excision, and the patient was referred to the cardiac surgery department, which accepted the case. Valve repair surgery and tumour excision was performed (CPB time 100 minutes): triangular resection of the anterior leaflet (A1 festoon) where the tumour was located and annuloplasty with Physio ring no. 34. Postoperative period in the intensive care unit (ICU) without incident, starting rehabilitation and early discharge from the ward. The biopsy was sent to the pathological anatomy service, confirming the definitive diagnosis of papillary fibroelastoma.  DIAGNOSIS Cardioembolic transient ischaemic attack. Mitral papillary fibroelastoma. Tumour resection surgery and mitral annuloplasty. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: No known drug allergies. CVRF: ex-smoker of one pack/day for 2 years after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Dyslipidaemia under pharmacological treatment. Cardiological history: under outpatient control for chronic ischaemic heart disease and dyslipidaemia. In 2016, inferoposterolateral ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEMI): catheterisation revealed severe coronary artery disease in two vessels: circumflex (acute lesion) and right coronary artery, with implantation of a drug-eluting stent in each of the vessels. Last echocardiogram (July 2017): non-dilated, mildly hypertrophic left ventricle (LV) with preserved global systolic function and inferoposterior hypokinesia. Trivalve aortic valve without functional alterations. Mitral valve without detectable functional alterations. Non-dilated right ventricle (RV) with good function. No tricuspid insufficiency (TI) detected. Pulmonary acceleration curve not suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion. No known bronchopathy. No history of surgery. Usual treatment: omeprazole 20 mg (1-0-0), aceltisalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg (0-1-0), ramipril 2.5 mg (0-1-0), rosuvastatin 20 mg (0-0-1), ezetimibe 10 mg (0-0-1).  CURRENT DISEASE: The patient attends his cardiology outpatient appointment, one year after the infarction. Subjectively he is well, without dyspnoea or new episodes of chest pain on exertion. Since the last change in his statin treatment, he has had no more muscle pain. He goes outside daily and walks for more than 1 hour. He climbs up to his usual home (3rd floor) using the stairs without dyspnoea which forces him to stop to rest. He denies orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Impatient for the results of the blood test. Since admission for the AMI, he was diagnosed with dyslipidaemia, starting treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg, which had to be suspended 4 months after starting it due to disabling muscle pain. He is currently being treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 135/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 85 bpm, arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulsimetry (SpO2) 98% room air. Eupneic at rest. C/C: No jugular plethora. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Extremities: no oedema or evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 80 bpm. Normal axis. Normal PR. Narrow QRS. Q wave in DIII and avF, without acute repolarisation alterations. ANALYSIS: glucose 83 mg/dl, urea 53 mg/dl, creatinine 0.93mg/dl, total cholesterol 160 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 47mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 70 mg/dl, triglycerides 130 mg/dl, CK 112 U/l, GOT 17 U/l, GPT 30 U/l, GGT 45 U/l, sodium 141 mmol/l, potassium 4.6 mmol/l, haemoglobin 14.6 g/dl, leucocytes 8.40010^3/μl (N 45%), platelets 267.000 10^3/μl. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated, mildly hypertrophic LV with preserved global systolic function and inferoposterior basal hypokinesia. Pseudonormalised diastolic pattern. Normal aortic root (35 mm). Trivalve aortic valve without functional alterations. Normal mitral valve in structure and function. Non-dilated RV with good function. No TR detected. Pulmonary acceleration curve not suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After the AMI, the patient was diagnosed with dyslipidaemia. He initially started treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg, which had to be discontinued after 3 months due to incapacitating myalgias, with no evidence of myositis or rhabdomyolysis. Subsequently, rosuvastatin 40 mg was prescribed, achieving improvement in muscle pain, but without complete cessation, requiring a decrease in the dose to rosuvastatin 20 mg in the fourth month of the event. This brought about a great symptomatic improvement with disappearance of the myalgias, and she was able to maintain a normal active life. However, at the next outpatient check-up 6 months after the cardiovascular event, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels recommended for secondary prevention were not achieved, so ezetimibe was added to the treatment, and special emphasis was placed on the importance of compliance with hygiene and dietary measures. He was seen again one year after the AMI. At the present time, the patient reports being completely asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view, although somewhat nervous and desperate due to the impossibility of achieving adequate control of LDL-C levels. He follows a Mediterranean diet with low fat intake, walks daily at a brisk pace for 2 hours and takes all his medication exhaustively. With all this, finally, optimal target LDL-C levels have been achieved, knowing that our patient has a very high established cardiovascular risk.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Dyslipidaemia that is difficult to control. Intolerance to statins (myalgias). Preserved LV systolic function. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: Family history: several affected relatives in the previous two generations of early ischaemic heart disease. Personal history: No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: ex-smoker for 20 years (5 packs/year). Dyslipidaemia type heterozygous monogenic familial hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia. Hyperuricemia. No arterial hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Other history: stable meningioma in the pontocerebellar angle followed periodically with magnetic resonance imaging.  Cardiological history: Ischaemic heart disease debuting in 2000 with exertional angina. An ischaemia test was performed, which was positive with high-risk criteria, so the patient was offered a cardiac catheterisation, which he accepted. Two-vessel coronary artery disease was detected: 99% stenosis in the proximal and middle anterior descending (AD) and under-occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) at a very distal level. Percutaneous revascularisation was performed with two drug-eluting stents in the proximal and middle LAD. Normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Valvular heart disease of the severe aortic stenosis type, symptomatic due to exertional dyspnoea since March 2015. He had been asymptomatic from the point of view of angina. Pre-surgery cardiac catheterisation: severely calcified coronary arteries, with moderate and short stenosis of the ostium of the left coronary trunk (LMCA) not significant by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), the stents of the middle LAD are patent and without restenosis. Stenosis of 90% in the middle LAD, distal to the stents. Chronic occlusion of proximal DC, the middle DC is filled by homocoronary collaterals, the posterior descending and posterolateral collaterals are dependent on the left coronary artery. Cardiac surgery in August 2015, aortic valve replacement with St. Jude mechanical prosthesis no. 19 and bypass of the left mammary artery to the LAD, with good postoperative evolution. Chronic treatment: warfarin, omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 hours, allopurinol 100 mg/24 hours, rosuvastatin 40 mg/24 hours, ezetimibe 10 mg/24 hours. Current status: asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view. Walks 1-1.5 hours a day, reports a low-salt diet and no saturated fats, never smoked again. Good adherence to treatment assured by the patient and his close family.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 127/78 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 68 bpm. Body mass index (BMI) 26.5 kg/m2. Corneal arcus already described since 2000, when ischaemic heart disease debuted at the age of 39. Jugular venous pressure normal. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, normal prosthetic sounds. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen soft, depressible, non-painful, no palpable masses or megaliths. Lower extremities without oedema, with peripheral pulses present and symmetrical. No tendon xanthomas were observed on inspection.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 68 bpm. Normal axis. Normal PR. Narrow QRS. No repolarisation alterations. Current ANALYTICS 2018: glucose 95 mg/dl, normal renal function (FGR 80 ml/min). Total cholesterol 145 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 67 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 48 mg/dl. Triglycerides 149 mg/dl. Transaminases normal. CK normal. TSH normal. HbA1c 5.5%. Previous LDL cholesterol figures and lipid-lowering treatments prescribed: April 2000, no treatment: LDL 210 mg/dl. June 2000, simvastatin 40 mg: LDL 135 mg/dl. April 2015, atorvastatin 40 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg: LDL 85 mg/dl. October 2015, rosuvastatin 20 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg: LDL 73 mg/dl. June 2016, rosuvastatin 40 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg: LDL 65 mg/dl.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Patient at very high cardiovascular risk with early ischaemic heart disease and clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Throughout the follow-up, she complies well with the lifestyle recommendations and adheres well to treatment. Increasing lipid-lowering treatment with good tolerance is required until LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels < 70 mg/dl are achieved with rosuvastatin 40 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic stable ischaemic heart disease: two-vessel coronary artery disease partially revascularised percutaneously and surgically. Valvular heart disease: severe symptomatic aortic stenosis on trivalve valve, corrected by aortic valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. Normal left ventricular systolic function. Heterozygous monogenic FH. LDL-C in range with combined treatment. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 31-year-old woman with no past history of interest consulted for occasional palpitations and syncope related to physical and emotional stress that had started 5 months earlier. She had a family history of infarction in a paternal grandfather (88 years old) and vasovagal syncope in a brother (25 years old). On first examination, the patient was normotensive and afebrile, well perfused, eupneic at rest and with good skin and mucous membrane colouring. Carotid pulses were rhythmic and symmetrical and there was no jugular engorgement. Cardiopulmonary auscultation showed rhythmic tones and no murmurs with preserved vesicular murmur. There was no pain on superficial or deep abdominal palpation, no masses or megaliths and hydroaerial sounds were present. Pedial and posterior tibial pulses were present and symmetrical and there was no malleolar oedema or stigmata of venous insufficiency or deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests were unremarkable and the chest X-ray showed a normal cardiac silhouette, with no alterations in the bronchovascular pattern or alveolar or interstitial infiltrates and free costodiaphragmatic angles. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 54 bpm, axis at 60o, PR 124 msec, narrow QRS, without ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram showed a non-dilated and non-hypertrophied left ventricle, no gross alterations of segmental contractility, preserved ejection fraction (62%) and no pericardial effusion. A 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram showed frequent bouts of non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia of helical morphology and high-density ventricular extrasystoles of various morphologies, the most frequent being complete left bundle branch block with inferior axis, with frequent R-over-T phenomena.  EVOLUTION In view of these findings, the patient was admitted to the Cardiology Department. The determination of metanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid in 24-hour urine was normal. During her stay she remained with telemetry, presenting occasional ventricular extrasystoles, some couple and very occasional triplets, without more complex forms. A transthoracic echocardiogram with contrast showed areas of non-compaction in the postero-lateral mid-apical region (ratio compacted/non-compacted myocardium 1.5 in end-systole and 2.2 in end-diastole), with Doppler flow between the intertrabecular recesses. On the other hand, simple ergometry was performed without beta-blockers, which was conclusive, clinically and electrically negative for ischaemia, although showing frequent ventricular extrasystoles of different morphology from the second Bruce stage onwards, which joined in pairs from the third stage onwards, and bouts of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia from the fourth stage onwards. Beta-blocker therapy was started, with good tolerance, and a second ergometry performed 48 hours later showed a marked improvement of arrhythmias with extrasystoles and isolated triplets at high load. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was also performed, which confirmed areas of non-compaction in anterior and lateral mid-apical regions, with a ratio between non-compacted/compacted myocardium of 3.75 and 4.5 respectively, with no enhancement in the late uptake sequence or hyperintensity in the pT2 sequences with fat suppression and preserved LVEF (68%). The genetic study revealed that the patient carried the variant 1:237947553 G/A in heterozygosis of the RyR2 gene, a missense mutation that causes an amino acid substitution of glycine for arginine (Gly4181Arg), not previously described as pathogenic for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (non-conclusive result) or non-compaction cardiomyopathy. The patient evolved well and three months later is asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence.  DIAGNOSIS Polymorphic non-sustained catecholaminergic ventricular tachycardia with inconclusive genetic study. Non-compacted left ventricle. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 69-year-old male, worked in indoor mining. No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): ex-smoker for 40 years, accumulated 25 paq/year. Ex-drinker. No known metabolic disorders. Meets criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and partially for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Segmental pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in 2015 for which she received anticoagulation with acenocoumarol. Cardiological history: in December 2017, acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with 2-vessel coronary artery disease (AMD and PD) with partial revascularisation. On admission, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed and detected mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) without valvular heart disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) preserved with normofunctioning right ventricle (RV). No family history of early sudden death. Treatment: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, acenocoumarol, atorvastatin 80 mg, bisoprolol 2.5 mg, hydroxychloroquine, hydroxyzine and ranitidine.   CURRENT ILLNESS: The patient attends the emergency department for chest pain. He reports that 2 hours before consulting and while sitting down after eating, he began to experience central thoracic oppression with irradiation to the left upper limb that reminded him of the previous STEMI, although of lesser intensity. He denied having had anginal episodes since revascularisation. Good adherence to the prescribed treatment. On arrival, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed which showed sustained monosystolic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) that was well tolerated haemodynamically, so it was decided to perform pharmacological cardioversion with procainamide. After 700 mg in 100 mg boluses, the patient reverted to sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to complete studies.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 140/80 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 160 bpm. SatO2 without oxygen therapy 98%. Afebrile. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, tachycardic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no added sounds. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation. Lower limbs well perfused, positive and symmetrical pulses. No neurological focality on examination.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS BIOCHEMISTRY: renal function and ions normal. Ultrasensitive troponin T 17 ng/l, without significant elevation (limit 35 ng/l). Haemogram: haemoglobin 14.9 g/dl, leucocytes 8170 with normal formula, platelets: 278000. CHEST X-RAY: normal cardiothoracic index with no evidence of acute pathology. ECG on arrival: VT with morphology of left bundle branch block (LBBB), inferior axis and V3-V4 transition. Postcardioversion ECG: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm, negative T in I and aVL and from V4 to V6. Baseline ECG (2015): SR at 65 bpm, negative T in I and aVL and from V4 to V6. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): RV of normal size with dyskinesia in the anterior wall at mid-ventricular level and small sacculations of the free wall at subtricuspid level, right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) 44%. Normal sized LV with basal septal hypertrophy (14 mm) and mildly depressed LVEF. Small area of intramyocardial late enhancement at the inferior junction of both ventricles at mid level. TTE: mild LVH with preserved LVEF.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the morphology of the VT, suggestive of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), a CMR was performed to rule out myocardial eschar as the origin of the same and a slightly affected LVEF was observed, but an LVEF of 44% with small subtricuspid sacculations and an area of dyskinesia. An electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed, showing VT with LBBB morphology, inferior axis and transition in V3 and V4. In addition, a zone of maximum precocity is determined at this subtricuspid level where the tachycardia is terminated by performing an effective ablation. The patient remained asymptomatic and without new arrhythmic events at post-discharge follow-up. However, given the VT morphology, CMR alterations and baseline ECG characteristics, all minor criteria for RV arrhythmogenic dysplasia, the borderline diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is established.  DIAGNOSIS TVMS of the anterolateral aspect of the RV cardioverted pharmacologically with procainamide and successfully ablated. 2-vessel coronary artery disease with partial revascularisation. Slightly impaired LVEF. Possible arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia (3 minor criteria = borderline diagnosis). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 64-year-old male diagnosed with dextrocardia at 54 years of age, following family screening. Toxic habits: non-smoker, moderate drinker. He leads an active life.  CURRENT DISEASE: At the time of diagnosis in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I with recurrent symptoms of palpitations, dizziness and syncope, limiting his quality of life. The night before admission she presented with precordial pain and palpitations together with loss of postural tone and level of consciousness, for which she consulted her doctor, who arranged hospital admission for medical care and examination.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 120/80 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 100 bpm. Oxygen saturation 97%. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normoventilation, no crackles. Abdomen nondescript. Lower limbs without oedema. Neurological examination: normoreactive isochoric pupils. Normal cranial nerves. Normal language. Strength and sensitivity preserved. Normal gait.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: dextrocardia. Cardiothoracic index greater than 0.5 with slight vascular redistribution to upper fields.  ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm. Atrioventricular conduction preserved, QRS 120 ms with axis -30o. Initial Q wave in aVL. Negative T wave in DIII-aVF, DI-aVL and V5-V6. ANALYTICS: Hb 14 g/dl, Ht 42, Cr 0.9 mg/dl, NT-proBNP 1,000 pg/ml. HOLTER ECG: sinus rhythm with a maximum HR of 93 bpm, minimum of 50 bpm, average of 61 bpm. Ventricular extrasystoles in repetitive forms, three bouts of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, lasting seconds, with a maximum HR of 166 bpm. ECOCARDIOGRAM: left atrium (LA) slightly dilated. Left ventricle (LV) of normal diameter with moderate asymmetric septal hypertrophy (> 15 mm) with no obstruction across the LV outflow tract and no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Mild LV systolic dysfunction (EF 55%) and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. CARDIAC NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (CMRI): late gadolinium enhancement irregularly distributed in the medial wall of the entire septum, anterior wall and free wall of the right ventricle. Interventricular septum 15 mm thick. CARDIODESFIBRILLATOR CONTROL: programmer shows appropriate shocks.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his admission, the patient was asked about his family history: his paternal grandfather and two of his uncles died of MS. We found a patient with clinical symptoms that limited his quality of life and, after the studies performed, the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was confirmed. An intermediate risk of SD was estimated (HCM Risk-SCD Calculator: 5-year risk of 4.68%), and a decision was made to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of SD. After a stable period of 11 months, he presented appropriate ICD shocks at 80 J, demonstrating the effectiveness of the therapy in the prevention of SD in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The evolution at the following year is favourable. Medical treatment was optimised, and the absence of ICD discharges was found in the controls, and the control electrocardiogram was in sinus rhythm. A control echocardiogram was performed, showing LV with moderate asymmetric septal hypertrophy, which has not progressed, and maintaining LV systolic function (EF 57%). No dynamic gradient was observed in the LV outflow tract.  DIAGNOSIS Non-obstructive asymmetric septal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Family history of MS (2nd degree). Repeated syncope. Record of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Late intramyocardial enhancement on cardiac MRI. ICD carrier with appropriate shocks. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: This is a 17-year-old male patient, the younger of two siblings. His older sister (index case) has clinical suspicion of MFS, presenting with marfanoid habitus and ectopia lentis but no aortic dilatation (she is the index case but does not meet diagnostic criteria for MFS). The patient's mother has marfanoid habitus, but has not developed ectopia lentis or aortic dilatation. After family screening, our patient, a competitive sportsman (basketball), was studied.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was normotensive and afebrile, well perfused, eupneic at rest and with good skin and mucous membrane colouring. Carotid pulses rhythmic and symmetrical. No jugular ingurgitation. Thoracic deformity due to pectus carinatum. Cardiopulmonary auscultation with rhythmic tones and no murmurs, with preserved vesicular murmur. Pedial and posterior tibial pulses present and symmetrical without malleolar oedema or stigmata of venous insufficiency or deep vein thrombosis. Positive wrist and thumb sign. Increased arm/stature ratio. Scoliosis. Subluxation of the crystalline lens.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): RS at 47 bpm. Narrow QRS. Normal axis. No repolarisation alterations. ECOCARDIOGRAM: left ventricle not dilated, with normal thickness and preserved function (EF 60%), highlights inferolateral and apical hypertrabeculation. Normal right cavities. Absence of valvular heart disease. Aorta not dilated with maximum diameter at sinus level: 31 mm.  CARDIAC NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MRI): no alterations of interest, except for increased trabeculation in the areas referred to in the echocardiogram, without fulfilling the criteria for non-compacted myocardium. Aorta within the normal range. EXERCISE TEST: stopped at minute 14.30 of the Bruce protocol after reaching the maximum theoretical heart rate (HR). Normal tension and chronotropic response. Isolated supraventricular extrasystoles. Conclusion: clinically and electrically negative for ischaemia. Good functional capacity. No significant arrhythmias. HOLTER-ECG: no significant arrhythmias. GENETIC STUDY: studied by massively parallel sequencing method using a library that includes 35 genes related to aortic-vascular syndromes. A heterozygous mutation in the FBN1 gene (p.Glu 1811Lys) previously described and considered pathogenic or associated with the disease and another heterozygous mutation in the FBN1 gene (p.Arg2Cys) previously undescribed and with uncertain pathogenicity are identified. CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient presents with marfanoid habitus (more than 7 points between characteristic systemic findings, including pectus carinatum and scoliosis) and lens subluxation. However, there was no aortic dilatation. In the absence of a family history of MFS, the diagnosis is not confirmed and genetic testing is necessary. After confirming the pathogenic mutation in the FBN1 gene, the diagnosis of MFS was confirmed, and the patient was advised against intense physical exercise and competition.  DIAGNOSIS MFS (systemic scores > 7 points and lens subluxation) without involvement of the cardiovascular system, with heterozygous mutation of the FBN1 gene. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Papillary accessory muscle in the ventricular sinus. No focal areas of late myocardial enhancement. Atria are not dilated. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY (post-implantation of a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD]): no notable alterations.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient evolved favourably in the ICU, remaining asymptomatic and tolerating low doses of beta-blockers. An echocardiogram was performed, showing normal LV function. RV dilatation with impression of hyperplasia of papillary muscles and anterior wall up to 8 mm thick, slight increase in pulmonary artery diameter (mild PAH). It was decided to implant a subcutaneous ICD, following prior screening and after performing a flecainide test due to suspicion of underlying Brugada syndrome, which was confirmed. She was discharged with a diagnosis of cardiorespiratory arrest (CRP) due to VF recovered by Brugada syndrome, pending the results of the genetic test.  DIAGNOSIS CRA due to VF. Coronary arteries free of significant lesions. Brugada syndrome (pending genetic study). Subcutaneous ICD implantation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION An 81-year-old hypertensive woman, type 2 diabetic, dyslipidaemic, ex-smoker and hypothyroid, with a history of rectorrhagia and a transient cerebrovascular accident in the middle cerebral artery territory 10 years ago, who came to the emergency department for chest pain and dyspnoea. For the last 5 hours, she reported intermittent episodes of about 10 minutes duration, oppressive central chest pain, non-radiating, not clearly related to exertion, with associated dyspnoea and no vegetative cortex. On first assessment, the patient was haemodynamically stable (blood pressure [BP] 105/65 mmHg, heart rate [HR] 75 bpm), well perfused, basal saturation 94%, eupneic, in good general condition, conscious and oriented. Carotid pulses were rhythmic and symmetrical, with no jugular engorgement. Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed an aortic systolic murmur that respected the second tone, with normal pulmonary auscultation. There was no oedema in the lower limbs and pulses were preserved.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): AF at 120 bpm, narrow QRS, left axis, left anterior hemiblock, right bundle branch conduction disorder, with no evidence of acute ischaemia. ANALYSIS: creatinine 0.86 mg/dl, no ionic alterations, liver profile within normality, first troponin T 100 ng/dl, second troponin T 60 ng/dl, Hb 10 mg/dl, platelets 140,000, no leukocytosis or neutrophilia, no coagulopathy. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with severe hypertrophy of the basal septum (17 mm). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) preserved (65%) with normal segmental contractility and impaired relaxation. Normal right ventricle (RV). Mild aortic stenosis without other valvulopathies. No pericardial effusion. CORONARYGRAPHY: severe lesion in the ostium of the right coronary artery (RCA) which is revascularised with a drug-eluting stent (DES) of biolimus without polymer. Moderate lesion in the first diagonal, with no lesions in the rest of the coronary arteries.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In view of these findings, the patient was admitted to the coronary unit and, after a loading dose, was started on double antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/24 hours by mouth and ticagrelor 90 mg/24 hours by mouth. On the fourth day of admission, she presented an episode of AF with rapid ventricular response that was cardioverted pharmacologically with amiodarone. As this was a patient with a high embolic risk (CHA2DS2-VASc 7) and a history of previous haemorrhage (HASBLED of 5), the problem of triple therapy was raised and it was decided to opt for the Redual-PCI strategy, continuing treatment with ticagrelor 90 mg/12 hours by mouth for one year, and dabigatran 110 mg/12 hours by mouth indefinitely. To date, no thrombotic or haemorrhagic events have been documented in the patient. DIAGNOSIS Acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Critical lesion in ostial DC revascularised with DES. Newly diagnosed AF CHA2DS2-VASc 7+ HASBLED 5. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Male, 70 years old.  BACKGROUND: - No known allergic drug reactions. - Toxic habits: ex-smoker. - Hypertension. No known diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia. - Aortic valve replacement due to double lesion (Carbomedics mechanical prosthesis no21) on 24 September 1993. Multiple subsequent complications: 9 November 1993: aortic pseudoaneurysm with compression of the right ventricle (RV) and aorto cutaneous fistula with sternal osteolysis. The fistula was closed at the aortic level and a sternal exeresis and plasty of both pectoral muscles with disinsertion of the humerus muscles (pectoralis major myoplasty) was performed. During this admission he required several re-interventions for bleeding in the context of coagulopathy, both cardiac surgery and plastic surgery. During his two months in intensive care (ICU) he developed multi-organ failure. 23 February 1995: reoperation for dehiscence of the prosthesis (periprosthetic leak) and implantation of a St. Jude prosthesis no. 21.  - Femoral pseudoaneurysm after preoperative coronary angiography. - Duodenal ulcer with gastrointestinal bleeding in 1999. - Spontaneous retroperitoneal haematoma in the context of anticoagulation. - Admission to cardiology in September 2017 for syncope with cardiogenic profile and no clear cause. Electrocardiogram (ECG) in sinus rhythm with left anterior hemiblock of the His bundle (HARIHH), absence of findings in telemetry monitoring and echocardiogram without relevant findings with mild-moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, normal biventricular function and normofunctioning aortic prosthesis. For all these reasons, it was decided to implant a subcutaneous Holter.  -Other: Repeated acute otitis media in both ears, predominantly in the left ear. Benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Usual treatment: acenocoumarol, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 hours, simvastatin 40 mg/24 hours, valsartan 160 mg/24 hours, dutasteride/tamsulosin 0.5/0.4 mg/24 hours.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Admitted on 7/12/2017 to the multipurpose ICU after presenting with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the context of a new syncopal episode with amnesia of the episode, with witnesses referring trauma to the frontal region and objectifying hypotension and bradycardia. On arrival at the ED, the patient was haemodynamically and respiratory stable with blood pressure (BP) 120/70 mmHg, INR 4.65 and sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. A cranial CT scan was performed showing subdural haematoma in the cerebral sickle without midline displacement. The subcutaneous Holter During the episode, the subcutaneous Holter monitor showed sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm without pauses, and pacemaker implantation was not recommended. During his stay in the ED, the patient began to have paresis of the right lower limb, so a repeat CT scan was performed, which showed an increase in subdural haematoma and foci of subarachnoid haemorrhage, and it was decided to admit him to the ICU. Initially, the patient presented with right hemiparesis and comical crises that required orotracheal intubation and surgical tracheostomy. Conservative management was decided with good subsequent evolution, and the patient was transferred to neurosurgery, who requested a cardiology consultation due to syncope and a tendency to bradycardia without beta-blocker treatment, and on review of the subcutaneous Holter, multiple episodes of bradycardia and spells of complete atrioventricular block (AVB) were observed. Given the presence of these episodes, the patient was transferred to cardiology for monitoring and to evaluate the implantation of a permanent pacemaker.  PHYSICAL EXPLORATION (on admission to the ICU): Head and face: soft tissue wound in the right frontal region, without active bleeding. No other injuries. Neck: no wounds, haematomas or deformities were identified. Chest: Inspection: no bruises, good respiratory mechanics. No crepitus on palpation. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no pathological sounds. Cardiac auscultation: muffled, rhythmic tones, prosthetic opening click, no murmurs or extratones. Abdomen: inspection: abdomen not distended, not painful. Perineum: no signs of haematoma, no rectorrhagia. Back: no painful stitches or deformities. Extremities: no excoriations. No deformities. No joint instability. Neurological examination: GSC 15 (M6, O4, V5). Pupils isochoric, normoreactive. Motor: right lower limb paralysis. Muscle strength right upper limb 5/5, right upper limb 5/5, left lower limb 5/5, right lower limb 0/5.    COMPLEMENTARY TESTS MICROBIOLOGY: blood cultures (08/01/18): in two sets Enterococcus faecalis with antibiogram: ampicillin/amoxicillin S <=1, gentamicin 500 S <=500, strepto 1000 S < =1.000, vancomycin S 1, teicoplanin S <= 1. Subsequent blood cultures negative.  ANALYSIS: On admission: normocytic normochromic anaemia with Hb 9.7g/dl, normal platelets, normal leukocytes, with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) 10.39 mg/dl, INR 5.22. Biochemistry with renal profile without alterations, including creatinine 0.45 mg/dl which means a glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) > 90 ml/min, normal liver profile and thyroid profile. On discharge (06/03): CRP 0.73 mg/dl, without leukocytosis or neutrophilia, with Hb 10.2g/dl. Emergency ECG: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. Left axis, narrow QRS, HARIHH (similar to previous ones), without repolarisation alterations. CRANIAL CT (07/12/18): subdural haematoma in cerebral sickle with haematocrit levels. There is no midline displacement. Inflammatory changes in the left middle ear and maxillary sinuses.  ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC STUDY (11/1/18): TRANSTORACIC (TTE): left ventricle not dilated, with preserved systolic function. Normal right ventricle. Bidisc mechanical prosthesis in aortic position: movement of both occluders with increased transvalvular gradients (maximum/average 40/19 mmHg) without suspicion of obstruction (triangular jet morphology, acceleration time of 70 ms, AT/ET 0.3, DVI 0.57). Mitral valve: thickened leaflets, mild insufficiency. Tricuspid valve: poor visualisation, no significant insufficiency by colour Doppler. No indirect signs of pulmonary hypertension. Inferior vena cava not dilated with physiological inspiratory collapse (estimated DBP 5 mmHg). Aortic root, ascending aorta and aortic arch not visualised. Atrial septum intact, without suspicion of intracardiac shunt by colour Doppler. Pericardium of normal thickness and refractoriness, without effusion. Conclusions: increased aortic transprosthetic gradients without suspicion of obstruction. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): bidisc mechanical prosthesis in aortic position with movement of both occluders. Intraprosthetic lavage insufficiency is visualised with three trivial regurgitation jets. Rounded image of 4 mm x 3 mm visualised on the aortic side of the prosthesis suggestive of a wart. Thickening of the posterior area of the prosthetic ring, with extension towards mitroaortic fibrosis, thickened anterior mitral leaflet (at the level of A1-A2) and towards the interatrial septum, no fistulous tracts are visualised. Mitral valve with thickening of the anterior leaflet, no images compatible with vegetation. No mitral insufficiency. Rest of valves with no images compatible with vegetation. Conclusions: signs of IE: thickening at the posterior level of the aortic annulus, mitroaortic fibrosis and at the base of the anterior mitral leaflet suggestive of phlegmon. Small endocardial wart, visualised on the aortic side of the aortic prosthesis. Normal functioning aortic prosthesis.  Control TEE (23/1/18): signs suggestive of IE with slight progression with respect to the previous study at the level of the aortic annulus, but above all progression at the level of the anterior mitral leaflet with an image of an endocardial wart. Normally functioning aortic prosthesis. Mild mitral insufficiency. CRANIAL MRI (15/01/18): multiple acute cortical microinfarcts of supra- and infratentorial location. Given the multi-territorial involvement, they suggest embolic origin. Decreased size of the left frontal parenchymal parenchymal contusions and subdural haematoma. Abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast (07/02/2018): appearance of focal infarcts in the left kidney, of probable embolic aetiology. TEE (16/02/2018): signs suggestive of IE with abscessation at the level of the aortic ring/fibrous mitroaortic ring, aortic prosthesis with normal gradients, posterior periprosthetic leak related to the abscessed area of moderate degree.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the cardiology department, fever peaks were observed, with Enterococcus faecalis growing in blood cultures. He also had a positive urine culture for Citrobacter freundii (sensitive to fosfomycin and was treated). In view of the blood culture findings, treatment was started with ampicillin and ceftriaxone and an echocardiogram was requested to screen for endocarditis, which showed thickening at the posterior level of the aortic ring, mitroaortic fibrosis and the base of the anterior mitral leaflet suggestive of abscess, while at the same time a small wart was seen on the aortic prosthesis, all of which was compatible with endocarditis. As part of the protocol to search for septic embolisms, a cerebral MRI angiography showed multiple acute cortical micro-infarctions of supra- and infratentorial location (suggesting embolic origin) and a CT scan with no evidence of other peripheral embolisms. Given the presence of advanced local involvement, the case was presented at a medical-surgical session and surgery was ruled out, given the previous surgical history and the high technical complexity. A control echocardiogram was performed after 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy which showed progression with respect to the previous study with the appearance of an aortic perivalvular leak leading to mild aortic insufficiency, disappearance of the aortic wart and the appearance of a wart at mitral level. In this context, it was decided to add tigecycline to the antibiotic treatment due to its better penetration into soft tissues. Subsequently, in the fourth week of antibiotic therapy, he developed sudden pain in the left flank with elevated LDH and CRP, so a new abdominal CT scan was performed which showed the appearance of left renal infarcts. During the sixth week of antibiotic therapy, a new transesophageal echocardiogram was performed showing progression of the valvular lesions with abscessation at the level of the aortic annulus/mitroaortic fibrosis, which had previously been phlegmonous, with disappearance of the mitral wart and progression of the amount of leak, which was moderate. However, the patient was stable, with no evidence of heart failure, syncope or new relevant alterations in the electrocardiogram or telemetry, remaining afebrile with three rounds of sterile control blood cultures (after 1, 2 and 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment), completing a 6-week intravenous antibiotic cycle of ampicillin and ceftriaxone and 4 weeks of tigecycline with good tolerance. From the neurological point of view, she showed clear improvement with rehabilitation, being able to perform gross and fine motor exercises with the affected upper limb and to ambulate with the help of a support. Given the good clinical evolution and the echocardiographic worsening, outpatient antibiotherapy with dalbavancin 1,500 mg intravenous every 15 days was decided, once adequate tolerance had been verified, after administering the first two doses in hospital without complications, fever or positive control blood cultures. With respect to paroxysmal complete AVB, beta-blocker treatment was withdrawn. Given the presence of endocarditis, it was decided not to implant a pacemaker for the time being, maintaining subcutaneous Holter monitoring and outpatient follow-up by both cardiology and the infectious diseases unit, with the patient remaining clinically stable until the present day.  DIAGNOSIS Main diagnosis: IE due to Enterococcus faecalis on mechanical aortic prosthesis with undetermined door of entry (bacteraemia), dismissed for surgical treatment. Other diagnoses: Mitroaortic abscess with secondary mild-moderate aortic insufficiency. Multiple cortical cerebral microinfarcts and left renal infarction secondary to IE. Anaemia in the context of IE. Traumatic subdural haematoma and left frontal parenchymal parenchymal contusions in the context of traumatic brain injury after syncopal episode, with hemiparesis and comical crises in the acute phase. Paroxysmal AVB. Urinary tract infection by Citrobacter freundii. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with pathogenic LDL receptor mutation. Two sons with the same mutation. Atheromatosis of large vessels, with carotid involvement detected by echo-Doppler. Restrictive pulmonary disorder in relation to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Pending polysomnographic study. No known allergies. Intolerance to statins, with clinical manifestations of myalgias and elevated muscle damage enzymes (CK). Previous treatment: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg, atenolol 50 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg.  CURRENT DISEASE: A 79-year-old man with the history described above came to the endocrinology department for review of lipid-lowering treatment for secondary prevention after NSTEACS. The patient presented poor tolerance to statins, with muscle pain and elevated CK levels after attempting to increase the dose of 40 mg of atorvastatin. Despite the combination of 40 mg atorvastatin with 10 mg ezetimibe, the patient has LDL cholesterol levels of 145 mg/dl (well above the recommended limit of 70 mg/dl for this patient group). Therefore, treatment with PCSK9 protein inhibitors, specifically evolocumab, is proposed and accepted, starting at a dose of 140 mg subcutaneous every two weeks.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Congestive appearance. Weight 93.5 kg. Height 166 cm. Muscle mass index (BMI) 34 kg/m2. Blood pressure (BP) 140/80. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without murmurs.

ECG: sinus rhythm at 66 bpm, PR of 180 ms, narrow QRS at 60 degrees without acute repolarisation alterations.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient started treatment with evolocumab with LDL-cholesterol levels of 145 mg/dl. After one month of treatment the LDL-cholesterol level dropped to 26 mg/dl. Because of this sharp drop, both the patient and his general practitioner decide to discontinue evolocumab without consulting his cardiologist or endocrinologist, for fear of adverse effects related to such low cholesterol levels. Despite the endocrinologist explaining the absence of complications due to such low cholesterol levels, the patient has poor adherence to treatment with a rise in LDL cholesterol levels for one year, after which the patient agrees to resume treatment correctly. A further decrease in LDL cholesterol levels to 19 is obtained, so the patient is de-escalated by withdrawing ezetimibe, and the control observed in the last analysis is obtained. Image 2 shows the cholesterol evolution profile during this time.  DIAGNOSIS Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with established vascular damage and good control of cholesterol levels after starting treatment with PCSK9 protein inhibitors. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 50-year-old male, ex-smoker with no other history of interest, suffered out-of-hospital CPR. On arrival of the emergency services, advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) manoeuvres were started and VF was observed, requiring five shocks to restore sinus rhythm. Total CPR time was 40 minutes. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for support and treatment. Physical examination revealed no significant findings, and the patient remained haemodynamically stable with no signs of heart failure (HF) or audible murmurs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS TROPONIN I 0.33 --> 5.39 mcg/l. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm with evolution towards inferior necrosis: Q wave in II, III and aVf with accompanying R and flattened repolarisation. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: no alterations. CRANIAL CT: no significant alterations. CORONARY CHORONARYGRAPHY: coronary arteries without significant stenosis. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) neither dilated nor hypertrophic, borderline LVEF (50-52%), akinesia of inferior face and basal inferior septum. Normal diastolic pattern for age. Right ventricle (RV) neither dilated nor hypertrophic, preserved systolic function (TAPSE 20 mm, S wave ́12 cm/sec). Atria of normal size. Aortic valve trivalve, thin leaflets normofunctioning. Thin leaflet mitral valve with mild central insufficiency. Structurally normal tricuspid valve without insufficiency allowing estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP). No indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Inferior vena cava (IVC) slightly dilated (23 mm) with inspiratory collapse > 50%. Aortic root not dilated (34 mm sinuses of Valsalva). No pericardial effusion. CARDIAC MRI9 MAGNETIC RESONANCE showing: LV slightly dilated with preserved systolic function. Thinning and hypocontractility in inferoseptal, inferior and inferolateral segments at basal and medial level with oedema, hypoperfusion and subendocardial late enhancement greater than 50% in these segments. RV of normal size and function. These findings are compatible with acute phase infarction.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the high suspicion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as the cause of the CRA, and that it was a primary VF, cardiac MRI was requested in which signs compatible with acute phase infarction were observed. The patient evolved favourably, with early extubation, without neurological sequelae and maintaining haemodynamic stability. Days later he was discharged under double antiplatelet therapy, beta-blocker, high-potency statin and proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Up to the present time, he continues to progress well.  DIAGNOSIS CRP in VF in the context of inferior AMI. Coronary arteries without significant lesions. Preserved LV systolic function. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 47-year-old female, ex-smoker as the only cardiovascular risk factor and no previous cardiological history. In 2004 she underwent a right hemithyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule. Anatomopathological diagnosis of follicular adenoma. In 2013, he was diagnosed with diffuse fibrocystic mastopathy. In 2016, following abdominal distension, a large left retroperitoneal mass suggestive of primary adrenal neoplasia was found on CT scan. Functionality was ruled out and a unilateral adrenal adrenalectomy, left nephrectomy, splenectomy and para-aortic lymphadenectomy were performed. The anatomopathological study confirmed the diagnosis of stage II adrenal carcinoma. In 2017 diagnosis of uterine myoma. Family history: maternal grandmother breast neoplasia. Maternal grandfather lung neoplasia. Paternal grandmother leukaemia. Usual treatment: oral contraceptives, levothyroxine, hydrocortisone.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Regular follow-up in endocrinology and gynaecology. In the last control CT scan in endocrinology, no signs of recurrence of adrenal carcinoma were found. However, a mass was found in the left atrium, for which a study was requested in our consultations. She is asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view. She reported mild asthenia and weight gain in the last year, which she related to changes in pharmacological treatment.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The presence of cutaneous lentigines at multiple levels is noteworthy. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. No other striking findings.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Thoracic-abdomino-pelvic CT scan for endocrinology control: no signs of recurrence of adrenal carcinoma. Cystic lesion of 35 mm in the right adnexal region. Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. Juxtacisural pseudonodular lesion in LSI. Mass in left atrium, requesting study in our offices. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 80 bpm. No repolarisation alterations. Transthoracic echocardiogram: there was evidence of a mass in the left atrium (LA), of heterogeneous texture, adhered to the interatrial septum at the level of the fossa ovalis (myxoma as a first possibility; possible lipoma). Left ventricle (LV) of normal size, non-hypertrophic with preserved systolic function, without significant valvulopathy. Right ventricle (RV) not dilated with preserved systolic function. CARDIAC MRI: oval, well-defined mass depending on the interatrial septum (2 x 1.5 cm; craniocaudal axis 2.2 cm), implanted in the area of the foramen ovale, little pedunculated and does not alter the functionality of the mitral valve. Low signal intensity in cine sequences with central predominant contrast uptake, compatible with myxoma. Normal sized cavities and preserved biventricular function.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The mass and its implantation base were resected and the defect was closed with a pericardial patch. The patient's evolution was favourable after surgery and the control transthoracic echocardiogram showed preserved biventricular function and interatrial septum with no flow through it and no evidence of myxoma. The anatomopathological study confirms the diagnosis of myxoma.  DIAGNOSIS Cardiac myxoma. Multiple neoplasia syndrome: Carney syndrome. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 29-year-old male ex-smoker for the last year of a pack a day for 15 years, with no other personal history of interest. He does not take any treatment on a regular basis. As family history, his paternal uncle and grandfather died of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at an age over 65 years. Previous baseline ECG is in sinus rhythm with normal axis, narrow QRS with no repolarisation abnormalities.  CURRENT ILLNESS: The patient comes to the emergency department of our centre in July 2017 for a 48-hour course of intense odynophagia, making swallowing difficult and thermometric fever at home of up to 39 oC. She denies dyspnoea, cough or purulent expectoration. He has also been complaining for months of mechanical central thoracic discomfort that does not limit his usual activity.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On arrival at the ED, fever of 38°C and sinus tachycardia at 110 bpm were observed. He was haemodynamically stable with adequate blood pressure and good baseline oxygen saturation. Physical examination revealed an erythematous oropharynx with bilateral tonsillar pustular plaques and traces of secretions in the posterior pharyngeal wall, with no palpable lymphadenopathies. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYSIS: leukocytosis with neutrophilia, normal ions. VENOUS GASOMETRY: respiratory alkalosis. ECG on arrival at the ED (with fever of 38oC): sinus tachycardia at 110 bpm, normal PR, QRS 120 milliseconds. In V1-V2 there was an image of RsR' with descending ST-segment elevation and negative T wave. Compatible with Brugada type I pattern. ESG after an iv dose of paracetamol, 37 oC: sinus rhythm at 95 bpm, normal PR, QRS 113 milliseconds. In V1-V2 there is an image of RsR' with descending ST-segment elevation but less pronounced than in previous ECG and negative T wave. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram: no data of structural heart disease. Non-dilated left ventricle with normal wall thickness and normal systolic function. Right ventricle of normal size with normal systolic function. Normal sized atria. No valvular heart disease. Absence of pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Following these findings, the patient was re-interviewed and reported syncopal episodes of vasovagal profile (one episode in the last two years) related to heat or blood draws, with no other cardiovascular symptoms. He also denies a history of sudden death in his family. The patient was discharged with antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin for acute pharyngotonsillitis and was referred to the arrhythmia unit to complete the study, where a provocation test with flecainide was performed, which was positive. An electrophysiological study was performed, during which no inducible ventricular arrhythmias or prolongation of the HV interval were found. As the patient had no history of sudden death in the family, no spontaneous Brugada type 1 pattern, very low recurrence of syncope and a clear vasovagal profile, it was decided not to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and to perform clinical follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Electrocardiographic pattern of Brugada type I unmasked by fever. Syncope with a probable vasovagal profile. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 60-year-old patient, with a history of active smoking of 1 pack/day, dyslipidaemia, eosinophilic oesophagitis (under treatment with inhaled corticosteroids) and Tarlov's cyst with compression of left sacral roots. Family history of ischaemic heart disease. Cardiological history: recurrent episodes of chest pain. In 2015 an ischaemia test was performed, which was negative, and subsequently a coronary CT scan showed significant coronary artery disease. Coronary angiography showed severe right circumflex and coronary artery disease, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents was performed.  CURRENT ILLNESS: After taking moxifloxacin for bronchitis, she presented with an episode of sudden dyspnoea with generalised pruritus and chest tightness radiating to both extremities. She then suffered a syncopal episode. She was attended by 061 who observed: poor general condition, blood pressure (BP) 69/20, oxygen saturation (SatO2) 82% and on the electrocardiogram (ECG) sharp T waves with J point elevation of 2 mm in V3-V6. O2, fluid therapy and treatment as ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEMI) were started and the patient was transferred to hospital for primary PCI. The patient arrived at the haemodynamics ward with systolic blood pressure (SBP) 60 mmHg and drowsy, and treatment was started with plasma expanders and inotropes. Coronary angiography: coronary arteries without lesions and excellent results of previously implanted stents. Absence of aortic dissection. Ventriculography without segmental alterations and with competent mitral. On arrival in the ward, skin erythema. Subsequent control ECG in the observation room: normalisation of repolarisation with flattening of the T waves on the anterolateral side. Favourable clinical evolution with progressive disappearance of the skin rash and normalisation of blood pressure, and inotropic support could be withdrawn. Slight elevation of troponin I (peak TnI 0.46) in the biomarker serum. Admitted to cardiology with a diagnosis of anaphylactic shock after taking moxifloxacin + probable Kounis syndrome (KS) (coronary spasm in the context of allergic reaction).  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: BP 122/71, heart rate (HR) 82 bpm, SatO2 95%. Conscious and oriented, skin congestion, normohydrated. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, no murmurs. No jugular ingurgitation. Pulmonary auscultation: normal ventilation. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation. No masses or megaliths. No signs of peritoneal irritation. Peristalsis preserved. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS: glucose 96 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.54 mg/dl, Na 130 mEq/l, TSH normal. Cholesterol 116 mg/dl, HDL 46 mg/dl, LDL 54 mg/dl. Haemoglobin 11.1 g/dl, platelets 236 x 10^3/microl. Chest X-ray: no relevant findings. ECG (061): sinus rhythm at 97 bpm, hyperacute T waves with J point elevation of about 2 mm in V3-V6. ECG at discharge: sinus rhythm at 63 bpm. rs in III, aVF. T negative in III. ST rectilinear in V5-V6. ECOCARDIOGRAM: left ventricle (LV) of normal dimensions and wall thickness. Normal global systolic function, without segmental asymmetries of contractility. Normal diastolic pattern. Left atrium of normal dimensions. Normal right chambers, normocontractile right ventricle (RV). Mitral valve (MV): thin leaflets, not limited in its opening, competent. Aortic valve (VAo): trivalve, normal sigmoid leaflets, not limited in opening, competent. Aortic root and visualised portion of proximal ascending aorta normal. Tricuspid insufficiency (TI) minimal. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with normal inspiratory collapse. Normal estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs). Absence of pericardial effusion and intracavitary masses through this access route. CORONARYGRAPHY: coronary tree without lesions of interest, with TIMI 3 flow and excellent results of previously implanted stents. Absence of aortic dissection. Good left ventricular function, without segmental alterations and with competent mitral valve.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On the ward the patient remained stable, asymptomatic at all times. A control echocardiogram was performed showing normal systolic function, with no other alterations of interest. Due to a history of hyperreactivity in a patient with normal systolic function, without previous acute myocardial infarction (AMI), beta-blockers were discontinued. The patient was preferentially referred to the allergology department for monitoring. Asymptomatic and stable, the patient was discharged from hospital.   DIAGNOSIS Anaphylactic shock after taking moxifloxacin. Kounis syndrome. Chronic ischaemic heart disease: coronary arteries without significant angiographic lesions. Good results of previous stents. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of an 83-year-old man who came to our hospital with syncope of unclear aetiology.  HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: No AMC. Hypertensive, type 2 diabetic, dyslipidaemic, ex-smoker. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) moderate grade, chronic kidney disease stage IIIB, and peripheral vascular vascular disease in follow-up by vascular surgery. Surgical interventions: ascending aorta endoprosthesis in 2000 (in another centre outside our community) with left carotid-subclavian bypass and occlusion of left subclavian artery. He underwent an infrarenal aorto-bi-iliac abdominal endoprosthesis. Usual treatment: metformin 850/12 hours, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/24 hours, nevibololol/hydrochlorothiazide 5/25 mg/24 hours, atorvastatin 40 mg/24 hours.  CURRENT ILLNESS: 83-year-old male who comes to the emergency department of our centre brought by a neighbour for finding him fallen at home. He lives alone, with no direct family. Anamnesis was difficult due to the patient being disorientated in time and space. On rehistorising the patient during his hospital stay, the day before admission he began with central thoracic pain and paraparesis of the lower limbs, which prevented him from standing upright, as well as diffuse abdominal discomfort, with no other apparent associated symptoms. On asking his neighbour, he reported finding him at home with a wound in the occipital region, without loss of sphincter control; apparently the patient had been asymptomatic from a cardiovascular point of view for the previous few days.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Disoriented in time and space. Verbose. Blood pressure (BP) 160/85 mmHg. Heart rate 90 bpm. Afebrile. No IY. Occipital trauma. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: generalised hypoventilation with some scattered rhonchi. Lower limbs: no oedema, femoral and popliteal pulses present with abolished distal pulses. Abdomen: no pain on palpation, hydroaerial sounds present, no signs of peritoneal irritation. NRL: Bilateral PPCC preserved. Strength and sensibility preserved in all four limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS (ED): biochemistry: glucose 250 mg/dl. Creatinine 3.19 mg/dl, GFR (MDRD) 19 ml/min/m2. nA 140 mEq/l. K 4.9 mEq/l. Urea 89 mg/dl. GOT 25IU/l. GPT 16IU/l. Bilirubin 05 mg/dl. Haemogram: 21100 leukocytes (84% PMN, 4 % keys), Hb 7.8 g/dl, haematocrit 23%, 192000 platelets/mm3. Coagulation: INR 1.0, PT 100% ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 85 bpm, PR 180 ms, wide QRS with right bundle branch block. Chest X-ray P-A: cardiomegaly. Significant mediastinal enlargement displacing the left lung. Left pleural effusion. Cranial CT scan (emergency): bilateral frontoparietal extra-axial collection, suggestive of subdural haematoma with little compressive effect on the cerebral parenchyma. Small vessel ischaemic lesions. ECHOcardiogram (urgent): left ventricle of normal size, with preserved global and segmental systolic function (calculated at 65%). No contractility alterations are evident. Right chambers of preserved size and function. No significant valvulopathies. No evidence of pericardial effusion Thoracic ANGIO-CT (emergency): performed without contrast due to creatinine levels. Increase in the aneurysmal sac with respect to the previous study in December 2011. The current measurements are 11 x 11 x 14 cm in the transverse, anteroposterior and cranio-caudal axes respectively (the measurements of the previous study were 6 x 6 x 7 x 7 cm). There is a significant loculated left pleural effusion. Both in the aneurysmal sac and in the effusion, areas of increased attenuation are identified suggesting extravasation of blood. In the prosthesis located in the aortic arch, at the junction of the distal portion of the arch with the descending aorta, there is an area of irregularity and apparent interruption of the continuity of the prosthesis walls. ANGIO-CT scan of the aorta (day 1 of admission): endoprosthesis in the aortic arch, with slight bending in the proximal and distal areas. Large aortic aneurysm (11.5 cm) thrombosed, although with dense areas suggesting haemorrhage and therefore instability, especially in the anterior area. No direct or indirect leakage is demonstrated by this study. Above all, in the superior zone, calcifications are evident in the mural thrombus, indicating dissection, but no false lumen filling is seen. Pre-stent aorta of 36 mm and distal aorta of 31 mm. Patent left carotid-subclavian anastomosis. Significant left pleural effusion with haemorrhagic component with no visible leaks; it is loculated and lobulated, with collapse of LII and atelectasis of the lingula. Discrete mediastinal shift to the right side. The aneurysm compresses the pulmonary artery and the left pulmonary artery branch. Coronary calcifications. Aorto-bi-iliac endoprosthesis without complications. Thoracic ARTERIOGRAPHY (day 2 of admission): performed via the right humeral route. No contrast leakage or branches contributing to the aneurysmal sac were identified.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION An 83-year-old man with the aforementioned history was admitted to the hospital emergency department for syncope; after performing the appropriate complementary tests, acute aortic syndrome was detected and he was admitted to the coronary unit of our hospital. In view of the clinical stability of the patient, his comorbidity and in agreement with the cardiac surgery department of our hospital, intensive surveillance and conservative management were decided, starting first with antihypertensive treatment, transfusion of two red blood cell concentrates and serum therapy with a view to improving renal function in order to complete the study. On the first day of admission, a new control CT angiography was performed, this time with contrast, with no evident leakage and showing thrombosis of the aneurysm, and on the second day of hospitalisation, after stabilising the patient's renal function and in a situation of haemodynamic stability, a thoracic arteriography was performed with no evidence of contrast leakage. During his admission, the patient showed good clinical evolution, with haemodynamic stability, no neurological deterioration and progressive improvement in renal function. Finally, given the favourable evolution of the patient's condition, conservative management of his acute aortic syndrome was decided. On discharge, he was haemodynamically stable and asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view, and treatment was prescribed with beta-blockers and vasodilators at low doses. Likewise, he was assessed by the neurosurgery service without requiring treatment and, due to the lack of family support, he was assessed by the social worker and institutionalised.  DIAGNOSIS Acute aortic syndrome. Intramural haematoma secondary to leakage of ascending aortic stent. Rupture of aneurysmal sac with haemothorax. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 60-year-old male, no known drug allergies, as cardiovascular risk factors he is a smoker of 15 cigarettes/day, hypertensive and dyslipidaemic. Other antecedents include an anxious-depressive syndrome, chronic bronchitis with bronchodilator treatment and he is an ex-miner. He underwent surgery for a right hip fracture 5 years ago and a right ankle fracture more than 20 years ago. No personal or family history of heart disease or sudden death. He follows regular treatment with fluoxetine 40 mg/24 hours, omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours, bromazepam 1.5 mg/24 hours, valsartan 160 mg/24 hours, pravastatin 20 mg/24 hours, formoterol 100/beclomethasone 6 mcg 1 inhalation/24 hours, and salbutamol on demand.  CURRENT ILLNESS: On the day prior to admission, the patient reported starting with a catarrhal condition, with general malaise and no fever, for which reason he went to his primary care physician on the day of admission, who prescribed antibiotic treatment with moxifloxacin 400 mg. After taking the first dose, he began with intense itching of the scalp, followed by sweating, skin rash, oppressive non-radiating central thoracic pain and intense dyspnoea. They called emergency services and on arrival of 112 they found the patient dyspnoeic, with significant respiratory distress, hypotensive (blood pressure [BP] 80/60) and with an oxygen saturation of 78%, which improved after administration of serum therapy and bronchodilators, so he was transferred to our centre. On arrival at our centre, the patient was admitted to the emergency department and found to be haemodynamically stable and not in respiratory distress, with improvement in oxygenation parameters, and cardiology was contacted and he was admitted to the coronary unit of our centre.   PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 130/70. Heart rate 85 bpm. Temperature 36 °C. Conscious, oriented, good distal perfusion. Eupneic on room air without supplementary oxygen. Chest emphysematous. Head and neck: no IVY, no hepatojugular reflux. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: Global hypoventilation. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation. Extremities: no oedema, no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) (112): sinus rhythm at 95 bpm, PR 160 MS, narrow QRS. Axis 60o. Inferior ST supra-segment elevation. ECG (coronary unit): SR at 100 bpm, PR 160ms, narrow QRS. q III. ST segment normalisation. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: normal cardiothoracic index with no evidence of vascular redistribution. ANALYSIS (in the coronary unit): CBC: leukocytes: 18.8 10e3/ul (80.2% neutrophils, 16.7% lymphocytes); haemoglobin 17.5 g/dl; platelets 331 10e3/u. Biochemistry: creatinine 1.02 mg/dl (GFR 72ml/min/m2); urea 42 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium 4.1 mEq/l, blood glucose 119 mg/dl. Peak CK 232 U/l (normal range 10-192); peak CKMB 35 U/l; peak ultrasensitive troponin 195 ng/l (normal range 0-13). Total cholesterol 187; LDL 106; HDL 38; triglycerides 212. AST 23 U/l (normal range 15-41); ALT 15 U/l (normal range 0-13). Thyroid hormones within normal range. Coagulation: INR 1.02; prothrombin rate 89%. Arterial blood gas (FiO2 21%): pH 7.30, PCO2 37, PO2 76, bicarbonate 18, saturation 90%. CARDIAC CATHETERISM: coronary arteries without angiographically significant lesions. ECOCARDIOGRAM: left ventricle not dilated, with slight hypertrophy, with preserved global function without segmental abnormalities of contractility (LVEF calculated at 60%). Right ventricle of normal size and function. Left atrium slightly dilated. No valvular heart disease. Inferior vena cava not dilated with adequate inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. Normal aortic arch.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the coronary unit, the patient was asymptomatic, with no new episodes of angina, and haemodynamically stable, with normalisation of the repolarisation alterations that he presented at the beginning of the picture. A haemodynamic study was performed, showing coronary arteries without lesions and an echocardiogram showing a ventricle of preserved size and function with no contractility abnormalities. During admission, he presented acute renal failure, with metabolic acidosis that resolved with treatment, and a referral was made to the allergology department. After performing skin tests, the symptoms were interpreted as allergic vasospastic angina or KS secondary to moxifloxacin. Subsequently, during his stay in the cardiology ward, he remained asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view and it was decided to discharge him on the fifth day and continue outpatient controls.  DIAGNOSIS Allergic vasospastic angina (SK). Allergy to quinolones. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND:  Family history: Mother with early ischaemic heart disease (46 years old). Died at the age of 50 due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Uncles on maternal side with early ischaemic heart disease. Brother died at the age of 28 due to AMI. Brother with ischaemic heart disease at the age of 39.  Personal history: No known drug allergies No known toxic habits. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): no hypertension (HT), no known diabetes mellitus (DM). Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with positive genetic study (M334 mutation) under follow-up in the lipid and cardiovascular (CV) risk unit.  Cardiological history: chronic multivessel ischaemic cardiopathy: debut in December 2006 with inferoposterior AMI with partially revascularised multivessel disease (ADA and marginal with implantation of 4 drug-eluting stents, chronically occluded right coronary artery (RCA) with very diseased vessel). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) preserved. New admission in 2008 for unstable angina with new coronary angiography with slight luminal loss of previously implanted stents. Chronic occlusion of the RCA and no progression of the disease to other levels. In 2011, stress echocardiography was performed and was positive with ischaemia in the RCA territory, new catheterisation without restenosis of the stents implanted in the anterior descending artery (AD) and circumflex artery (CX). 100% occlusion of the middle RCA treated by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and two drug-eluting stents in the proximal and middle segments. Left hemispheric stroke in November 2010. Fibromyalgia. Operated on lumbar hernia. Usual treatment: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg c/24 hours; bisoprolol 2.5 mg c/24 hours; telmisartan 40 mg c/24 hours; pantoprazole 20 mg c/24 hours; NTG transdermal patch 10 mg; ezetimibe 10 mg c/24 hours; rosuvastatin 20 mg c/24 hours, duloxetine 60 mg c/24 hours; sublingual NFC if chest pain.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Patient with personal history of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia with positive genetic diagnosis and a history of revascularised early multivessel chronic ischaemic heart disease under follow-up in the lipid and CV risk unit of our hospital without reaching target therapeutic levels of LDL cholesterol according to current indications in secondary prevention, despite treatment with combined lipid-lowering agents at maximum tolerated doses in addition to multiple readmissions to cardiology for unstable angina with progression of coronary heart disease. In October 2014, given the persistent poor control of LDL cholesterol levels and his high cardiovascular risk, it was decided to include the patient in the LDL apheresis programme, which was started after performing an A-V fistula in MSI with good initial tolerance.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Good general condition, well hydrated and perfused. Eupneic at rest, tolerates decubitus. Afebrile and haemodynamically stable. Blood pressure (BP) 129/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 65 bpm. Positive corneal arc. Cardiorespiratory auscultation with rhythmic tones, no murmurs. Conservative vesicular murmur with no superimposed noises. Absence of oedema in the lower limbs with pulses present. Bilateral femoral murmurs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 78 bpm, normal axis. PR 128 msec, narrow QRS with low voltages in DIII. LIPID PROFILE (2014): total cholesterol 210 mg/Dl. Triglycerides 139 mg/dl. Apo-A Apolipoprotein 151 mg/dl. HDL cholesterol 52 mg/dl. LDL cholesterol 130 mg/dl. Apo-B Apolipoprotein 134 mg/dl. LDL/HDL 2.5. Lipoprotein (a) 59 mg/dl. ECOCARDIOGRAPHY: left atrium not dilated. Left ventricle (LV) of size (LVEDD 45 mm) and without wall thickening (septum 10 mm), slight apical hypokinesia with preserved global EF. Mitral valve with thin leaflets and preserved opening. Normal aortic root and valve. Normal right chambers. RV with preserved LVEF. No tricuspid insufficiency (TI). Carotid Doppler ultrasound: right internal carotid artery with concentric iosechoic plaque at its origin causing a stenosis of around 30%. Left internal carotid artery with hyperechoic plaque in the far wall of the bifurcation causing a stenosis of around 35%. A. dominant left and hypoplastic right vertebra. ILEO-FEMORAL DOPPLER ECOGRAPHY: using colour Doppler the iliac, common/superficial femoral and popliteal arterial systems of both lower limbs, obtaining flow curves with practically normal morphology and velocities in all the paths examined, with only minimal alterations being observed, although in no case compatible with significant stenosis. Conclusions: minimal atheromatous irregularities that in no case produce significant stenosis. Lipid profile pre-apheresis: cholesterol 190 mg/dl. HDL cholesterol 51 mg/dl. LDL cholesterol 117 mg/dl. Triglycerides 110 mg/dl. Apo-A lipoprotein 145 mg/dl. Apo-B Apolipoprotein 128 mg/dl. LDL/HDL 2.3. Lipoprotein 65 mg/dl. Lipid profile post-apheresis: cholesterol 76 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 41 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 28 mg/dl. Triglycerides 35 mg/dl. Apo-A Apolipoprotein 119 mg/dl. Apo-B Apolipoprotein 33 mg/dl. Last lipid profile: cholesterol 118 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 43 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 52 mg/dl, triglycerides 115 mg/dl.  CLINICAL COURSE The patient started the LDL apheresis programme in October 2014 with good tolerance, although he reported intense asthenia in the days following the sessions, which gradually improved. In the months following the start of the apheresis programme, the various follow-up visits showed that target LDL cholesterol levels were reached after the apheresis sessions, which remained above target levels during the interapheresis periods, but the patient began to show weight gain and progressive oedematisation from the start of the sessions, with significant fatigue after the sessions, which limited his life. A regular echocardiography was requested with preserved systolic function, known segmental contractility alterations and no significant valvulopathies. Given the regular tolerance to the last sessions, it was decided, together with the patient, to start treatment with a recently marketed anti-PCKS9 drug and to consider ending the LDL apheresis programme if good progress was made. In the following months, after starting treatment with an anti-PCSK9 drug combined with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, LDL levels of <70 mg/dl were maintained in the inter-apheresis lipid profiles, and so in August 2016 the patient was finally withdrawn from apheresis sessions. Subsequently, he has continued to undergo check-ups in the lipid unit until today, maintaining LDL cholesterol levels below the target levels in secondary prevention without complications or adverse effects related to the drug and allowing the titration of statin doses, as well as without new admissions or consultations for angina.  DIAGNOSIS Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with positive genetic study (M334 mutation) controlled under treatment with an anti-PCSK9 drug. Early revascularised chronic multivessel ischaemic heart disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 47-year-old female patient with the only history of being an active smoker of 10 cigarettes/day (IPA 9) and family history of myotonic dystrophy (MD) type I (Steinert's disease) in her brother and death of her father with no clear etiology. Younger brother aged 37 years with a diagnosis of type I DM; an older son who died at the age of 17, with the same diagnosis and autism spectrum disorder; and a 25-year-old daughter diagnosed with type 1 DM who presented cerebral haemorrhage at birth and is under investigation for long QT.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Referred from neurology with a diagnosis of type I DM to the family heart disease consultation for assessment. She reported asthenia and muscle fatigue with slightly less exertion than usual for the last 2 months. The patient is in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I and otherwise asymptomatic from a cardiovascular point of view.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Normal vital signs. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. Neurological examination showed mild bilateral ptosis, mild facial weakness despite complete ocular closure, generalised hyporeflexia, paresis 4/5 and myotonic buckle. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Echocardiogram TT: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with normal wall thickness, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 60-65%, no alterations of segmental contractility, anomalous movement of the septum in relation to conduction disorder, normal transmitral filling pattern, non-dilated right ventricle normocrontractile, non-dilated atria. Aortic, mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary valves morphologically and functionally normal. No signs of pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion. Inferior vena cava not dilated and with collapse greater than 50%. Aorta not dilated and no flow acceleration. ECG: sinus rhythm at 50 beats per minute, PR 220 milliseconds, axis at -30 o, QRS 130 milliseconds with image of left bundle branch conduction disorder, inverted T from V1 to V3, QTc 445 milliseconds. HOLTER: sinus rhythm throughout the recording. Average heart rate 61 bpm. No ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias. QTc 31% (470-490 msec), 5% (490-510 msec). ANALYSIS: biochemistry, haemogram and coagulation without findings. GENETIC STUDY: negative for long QT. MYBPC3 p.Arg726Cys, rare variant possibly associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy although with reports of families with second mutations and found in the general population (low frequency).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In summary, we are dealing with a 47-year-old patient diagnosed with type I DM with a family history of sudden death. In addition, she had a conduction disorder with wide QRS, first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) and a borderline QT on the Holter monitor. Although the conduction disturbance may influence the duration of the QT interval, there is a small percentage above 490 milliseconds. Conduction study and epinephrine test were requested. Positive epinephrine test (Shimizu protocol): after the bolus there is pathological QTc prolongation up to 566 milliseconds. Throughout the infusion the absolute QT slowly decreases to baseline values. Electrophysiological study: diagnostic quadripolar catheters are placed in the right atrium, His and right ventricular apex. Abnormal basal intervals (HV 78 milliseconds). Basally poor AV conduction with Wenckebach point at 78 bpm, concentric and decremental. Absence of V-A conduction. Due to the results of the previous tests, it was decided to implant a bicameral implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) after cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to complete the study. After ICD implantation, treatment was started with 1.25 mg of bisoprolol every 24 hours. Cardiac MRI showed a slightly dilated but not hypertrophic LV, with preserved systolic function (LVEF 55%) and no intramyocardial late enhancement or other alterations of interest. From the point of view of relatives, a long QT panel was performed, which was negative.  DIAGNOSIS Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (Steinert's disease). Absence of significant structural heart disease on TT echocardiogram and cardiac MRI. Long QT syndrome probably associated with DM. First-degree history of sudden death, probably arrhythmic. Significant nodal conduction disorder and His-Purkinje system with implantation of bicameral ICD. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 51-year-old woman with no known drug allergies, no cardiovascular risk factors.  Cardiological history: Ebstein's anomaly type congenital heart disease. Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) diagnosed at 18 years of age. Followed in cardiology outpatient clinic, in usual New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III/IV. Episodes of orthodromic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Holter study (October/2016): sinus rhythm without arrhythmic events. She does not take any treatment on a regular basis. Admitted to a regional hospital due to progressive worsening of his functional class in the last 3 months with progressive dyspnoea until becoming minimal effort. She reported a case of upper respiratory tract infection (one month prior to admission), coinciding with worsening dyspnoea until she was at rest and orthopnoea. No other symptoms. During his admission to El Bierzo Hospital, depletive treatment was started for congestive heart failure with a tendency to hypotension. Transfer to our centre was requested to complete studies and assess treatment options. When assessed in our department, she reported intense asthenia with improvement in dyspnoea. Blood pressure 124/88 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm. Cyanosis. Acropaquias. Basal oxygen saturation in the supine position 80%, in the sitting position 65%. Jugular venous pressure normal. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, systolic murmur in tricuspid focus III/VI, holosystolic. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without added noise. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful on palpation. No palpation of hepatomegaly or other masses. Lower extremities without oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis and symmetrical peripheral pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 75 bpm. PR 200ms. Qtc 480ms. Right bundle branch block (RBBB). Predominance of positive P wave component in V1. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: cardiomegaly, without signs of vascular redistribution. Free costophrenic sinuses. No condensation. ANALYSIS: haemogram: leucocytes 9000 mil/mm3 (N 78%, L 11%), Hb 13.9 g/dl, haematocrit 41.7%. MCV 92.4 fl, platelets 114000/mm3, haptoglobin 100 mg%. Coagulation: INR 1.2, PT 72%, TTPa 32 seconds. Biochemistry: glucose 87 mg/dl, urea 30 mg/dl, creatinine 0.98 mg/dl (FG 60), total cholesterol 108 mg/dl, HDL 31 mg/dl, LDL 64 mg/dl, triglycerides 64 mg/dl, GOT 24 U/l, GPT 2624U/l, total bilirubin 0.72 mg/dl, NT-proBNP 207 pg/ml. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.53, PCO2 30.4, PO2 51, bicarbonate 25.2. Echocardiogram: severely dilated right ventricle with depressed contractility. Normal sized left ventricle with preserved function. Severely dilated right atrium (RA) with interventricular septum bulging to the left. Thin leaflet pulmonary valve with normal opening. Post-valvular flow of 1 m/s with symmetrical branch Doppler flow. Tricuspid valve with Ebstein's morphology, more apical implantation of the septal leaflet, 48 mm from the mitral annulus, with IV/IV regurgitation. Triangular morphology in spectral Doppler, with maximum velocity of 2.4 m/sg. Normal mitral and aortic valves. After the injection of agitated saline, there was abundant spontaneous passage of bubbles to the left cavities, presenting syncope during the procedure, with subsequent progressive recovery and headache. No obvious atrial septal defect (ASD) was observed, so it was attributed to PFO. Conclusion: Ebstein's disease, IV/IV tricuspid regurgitation with ventricular dysfunction, right-to-left shunt due to probable PFO. HEMODYNAMIC STUDY (right femoral artery): ventriculography shows right-left shunt. After temporary occlusion of the defect with a balloon, it was found that the pressures in the right atrium did not increase and the arterial pressures did not fall. With the use of a 35 mm Amplatzer FOP Tribiform MF 35 mm device, the defect is almost completely occluded, with minimal residual shunt, with arterial saturation from 81% to 99% (video 4). No complications. Under control with intracardiac echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), an 18 mm balloon test was performed, showing no significant haemodynamic changes (blood pressure and right atrial pressure).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to complete the study due to progressive worsening of functional class. An echocardiographic study showed significant right-to-left interatrial shunt suggestive of PFO with platypnoea-ortodesoxia behaviour. With these results, it was decided to perform a percutaneous technique on PFO. Prior to definitive closure, haemodynamic response was assessed with transient balloon closure, which was favourable, so a 35 mm Amplatzer cribriform closure device was implanted, with good final results and arterial saturation increased from 81% baseline to 99%. Post-procedure, the patient was stable and asymptomatic, with improvement in functional class and baseline saturation, and it was decided to transfer her to her hospital of reference.  DIAGNOSIS Platypnoea-ortodesoxia syndrome. PFO with significant spontaneous right-left shunt. Congenital heart disease of the Ebstein's anomaly type. Global respiratory failure secondary to intracardiac shunt, resolved. Implantation of a percutaneous Amplatzer cribriform 35 mm PFO closure device. Massive tricuspid regurgitation with no signs of pulmonary hypertension. Preserved LVEF. Intermittent WPW syndrome. Episodes of orthodromic TPSV. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history 53-year-old male, active, civil servant. He had no drug allergies, had smoked sporadically (1-2 packs/year accumulated) and was diagnosed with mild arterial hypertension, with no other associated cardiovascular risk factors. He took omeprazole on demand for occasional dyspepsia, but did not take any treatment on a regular basis.  Current history She consulted her primary care physician for several episodes of oppressive central thoracic pain, of sudden onset, at rest, lasting a few minutes. The pain is not related to meals, does not change with respiratory movements or postural changes and is accompanied only by mild sweating. He was prescribed treatment with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg (1-0-0), bisoprolol 2.5 mg (1-0-1), omeprazole 20 mg (1-0-0) and sublingual nitroglycerin on demand and was referred to the Cardiology Department. He went to the emergency department a few days later because the symptoms persisted despite treatment. With the use of nitroglycerine, the duration was shorter, but not the frequency; he reported up to 7 episodes in the last 3 weeks, with a clear predominance at night.  Physical examination in the emergency department Blood pressure: 145/89 mmHg. Heart rate 60 beats per minute, basal oxygen saturation 100%. Temperature 36.5°C. Good general condition. Conscious, oriented, cooperative. Eupneic at rest. Not hydrated. Normal colour. Jugular venous pressure normal. Carotid rhythmic, no murmurs. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic without murmurs, friction rubs or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur, without extra sounds. Abdomen with no notable alterations. Lower extremities normal. Peripheral pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS  Emergency ECG: sinus rhythm at 55 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, without repolarisation alterations.  Emergency laboratory tests: haemoglobin 15.8 g/dl, leukocytes 8,650/mm3 (normal formula), platelets 212,000/mm3. Coagulation: prothrombin rate 91 %, activated partial thromboplastin time 26.6 s, fibrinogen 309 mg/dl. Biochemistry: glucose 113 mg/dl, urea 40 mg/dl, creatinine 1.13 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium 3.4 mEq/l, serial troponin I 0.00 ng/ml.  Chest X-ray in the emergency department: normal.  Echocardioscopy in the ED: left ventricle of normal size and overall systolic function, without alterations in segmental contractility. Right ventricle of normal size and systolic function Normal atria. Absence of significant valvular heart disease. Visible segments of the great vessels normal. Normal pericardium.  Stress test: discontinued at minute 10.50 of the Bruce protocol (11.80 METS) for reaching the maximum theoretical heart rate. Normal blood pressure and chronotropic response. No arrhythmias were recorded. Conclusion: clinically and electrically negative for ischaemia.  Holter ECG of events of 10 days duration: coinciding with an episode of chest pain identical to the previous ones, ST segment elevation of a few minutes duration is recorded, as well as frequent supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles.  CT scan of the coronary arteries: calcium score 191. Calcific plaques were seen in the proximal third of the anterior descending and circumflex arteries that did not cause significant stenosis, as well as soft plaque in the middle third of the anterior descending artery that caused 50% stenosis.  EVOLUTION During his stay in the ED, the patient remained asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable at all times. Serial myocardial damage markers were negative. He was assessed by the on-call Cardiology team, who performed echocardioscopy where no alterations were observed. In view of the characteristics of the episodes, the possibility of coronary vasospasm was raised, so nitrates were added to his treatment and it was decided to complete the study on an outpatient basis. Admission was not considered necessary because the episodes of pain had not increased in intensity or duration and were not accompanied by palpitations, dizziness or syncope. The Holter recording of long-term events two weeks later showed transient ST-segment elevation coinciding with a new episode of chest pain, identical to the previous ones, confirming the diagnosis of coronary vasospasm. Bisoprolol was discontinued (the patient had already discontinued nitrates due to headache and acetylsalicylic acid due to dyspepsia) and diltiazem was started at a dose of 120 mg every 12 hours. Given that he did not perform strenuous physical exertion, ergometry was requested, which was clinically and electrically negative for ischaemia. Despite this result, in order to rule out underlying obstructive coronary lesions with greater certainty, a CT scan of the coronary arteries was performed, which showed non-significant stenosis in the anterior descending and circumflex arteries, and simvastatin was added to his treatment at a dose of 20 mg daily. The patient has progressed well, with no recurrence of symptoms to date. It is explained to him that in order to avoid new episodes as far as possible, it is essential that he abstains from smoking and adheres to the pharmacological treatment.  DIAGNOSIS Vasospastic angina. Coronary arteries without significant lesions. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 60 year old patient who attended the Emergency Department on 26/08/2016 due to pain in the right lower limb  Personal history Intolerance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Arterial hypertension under pharmacological treatment with poor control. Dyslipidaemia under pharmacological treatment. Anxiety syndrome.  Cardiological history: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation diagnosed on 01/08/2016 with CHA2DS2-VASc = 2 and HAS-BLED = 1. Treatment was started with beta-blockers and acenocoumarol. Echocardiogram: LVEF 60%. LA dilatation. Mild mitral stenosis. Episode of mild heart failure in the context of AF with rapid ventricular response on 13/08/2016 which was treated in the emergency department with diuretics and digoxin.  Current illness The patient came to the ED with pain, coldness and functional impotence of the right lower limb.  Physical examination BP 178/99 mmHg, HR 109 bpm, SatO2 99 %. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic sounds at 110 bpm with systolic murmur II/VI with preserved 2R. Pulmonary auscultation: minimal bibasal crackles. Right lower extremity: decreased pulse and coldness in MID with intense pain on palpation.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: urea 24 mg/dl, creatinine 0.89 mg/dl, Na 139 mmol/L, K 3.9 mmol/L, Hb 15.8 g/dL, Ht 45.8%, platelets 396,000, INR 1.47. D-dimer > 5000 ug/L. ECG: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at 120 bpm. ST segment rectification with data of LV overload and negative T wave in DIII and aVF. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. Congestive hilae. Vascular redistribution. No condensation or pinching of costophrenic sinuses. MID Doppler ultrasound: decreased monophasic blood flow in the superficial femoral artery with echogenic material partially filling the lumen of the artery. The flow decreases even more in intensity in the distal arteries without being detected in the distal posterior tibial and anterior pedial arteries. Conclusion: MID arterial ischaemia due to thrombosis. Ultrasound Doppler MII: occupation of the left popliteal a. Popliteal left by echogenic material not in its entirety without flow in Doppler study and with post-stenotic morphology at the level of posterior tibial artery. Conclusion: arterial ischaemia in popliteal artery. Cranial/perfusion computed tomography: acute ischaemic stroke in the left MCA territory secondary to carotid occlusion of the ICA, ICA, IMCA-M1 and ACA-A1 of cardioembolic profile with mismatch 30%. Angio-CT: floating thrombus at the level of the aortic arch distal to the ICA exit occluding the origin of the left subclavian artery. Echocardiography: moderate mitral stenosis of rheumatic aspect. Severe dilatation of the left atrium. LVEF 60%. Aortic sclerosis.  EVOLUTION Given that the patient presented pain and coldness in the right lower limb (MID), a Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs was performed which confirmed acute arterial ischaemia due to thrombotic occlusion at the level of the right superficial femoral artery. Treatment was started with intravenous sodium heparin and contact was made with Cardiovascular Surgery at the referral hospital and the patient was referred for evaluation. On arrival, given that the patient showed signs of acute ischaemia of the entire limb despite perfusion, mechanical embolectomy was performed with dissection of the right femoral tripod and MID embolectomy with Fogarty catheter associated with heparin lavage, haemostasis and closure. At 24 hours, the patient remained haemodynamically stable and a repeat Doppler ultrasound scan was performed with recovery of biphasic flow at femoral level. A review of the patient's INR since the start of anticoagulation had presented INR < 2 with time in therapeutic range of 0 %. Despite having suffered an embolic event with a SAMe-TT2R2 = 2 (which already predicts that the patient will have poor quality anticoagulation with antivitamin K), CHA2DS2-VASc = 4 and HAS-BLED = 2, it was decided to maintain treatment at discharge with acenocoumarol. On 19/02/2017 the patient returned to the emergency department for pain, coldness and functional impotence in the left lower limb, this time with absence of distal pulse. An echo Doppler of the MII was performed and showed arterial ischaemia in the popliteal artery. Given that the occlusion was at a more distal level and the echogenic material did not occlude the lumen completely, intravenous sodium heparin perfusion was started. On the 5th day of admission (24/02/0217) the patient suddenly presented pain and coldness in the left upper limb and 1 hour later presented dysarthria with haemiplegia of the right limbs. On suspicion of intracranial bleeding in the context of intravenous sodium heparin perfusion, a cranial CT scan was performed which ruled out intracranial bleeding. In the following hours, the patient presented a sudden deterioration in the level of consciousness with aphasia and left gaze deviation. With suspicion of stroke in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, the Stroke Code was activated (NIHSS = 22) and the patient was referred to the reference hospital. On arrival, a brain CT scan was performed which confirmed acute ischaemic stroke in the left MCA territory secondary to carotid occlusion of the ICA-MCA. However, the angio-CT scan also showed a floating thrombus at the level of the aortic arch distal to the exit of the LMCA (left common carotid artery) occluding the subclavian artery. Given the seriousness of the patient and the fact that she was being treated with sodium heparin, it was decided to perform a primary mechanical intra-arterial thrombectomy with aspiration of the cervical thrombus and fragments at the level of the LMCA-ICCA. A control CT scan showed extensive infarction with mass effect that improved progressively over the following days in the ICU, with improvement in aphasia but with right hemiplegia remaining as a sequela on discharge. At the MSI level, there was an improvement in arterial ischaemia and pulse recovery, so conservative management was decided. However, there was no improvement in the MII, presenting a very weak femoral and popliteal pulse with absence at distal level, so it was decided to perform arterial thrombectomy with dissection of the left femoral tripod and extraction of thrombotic material at the left femoro-popliteal level with a Fogarty catheter. Cardiologically, the patient initially showed signs of decompensated heart failure due to rapid AF that improved with diuretics and beta-blockade. Echocardiography was performed and showed moderate rheumatic mitral stenosis with severe dilatation of the left atrium and normal LVEF. All INRs were reviewed since discharge in August 2016 and only 2 of them were in therapeutic range with a TRT of 0%.  DIAGNOSIS Ischaemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory secondary to tandem ICA-MCA occlusion with a cardioembolic profile. Floating thrombus at the level of the arch with occlusion of origin of the left subclavian artery. Acute arterial ischaemia of MSI with spontaneous resolution.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history 74-year-old woman. Cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension. Dyslipidaemia. Cardiological history: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since 2002, on treatment with sintrom. She continued treatment with amiodarone until 2010, withdrawing due to interstitial pneumopathy. In relation to an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation, he required admission for acute pulmonary oedema and electrical cardioversion in 2002. The echocardiogram prior to admission showed moderate rheumatic mitral regurgitation, normal LVEF and severe dilatation of the left atrium. Other antecedents: episode of DVT and PTE in 2002 (in the same admission in which atrial fibrillation was diagnosed). Breast carcinoma (surgery and radiotherapy in 2006). Interstitial pneumopathy probably related to amiodarone. Baseline situation: IABVD. NYHA CF II. Usual treatment: enalapril 5 mg/12h, torasemide 5 mg/d, acenocoumarol according to guideline (10.5 mg/week), atorvastatin 20 mg/d.  Current illness The patient was admitted for an episode of atrial fibrillation at 200 bpm, treated with beta-blockers (producing spontaneous cardioversion). A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, showing a thrombus in the left atrial appendage. On admission she had an INR of 3.5, but with great variability in previous controls, several below 2. On discharge, treatment with atenolol and enoxaparin was prescribed. Two months later, the patient returned to the ED for common atrial flutter, with resolution of the atrial appendage thrombus. It was then decided to ablate the tricuspid cavus isthmus. On a subsequent admission he developed left atrial flutter and treatment was started with atenolol, digoxin and acenocoumarol was reintroduced at this time. She again came to the emergency department for abdominal pain, with an INR of 4.4 and a CT scan showed an abdominal wall haematoma with active bleeding from the epigastric artery.  Physical examination General condition, skin pallor, sweating, tachypnoea. BP 135/75, HR 132, Sat 94 %. Afebrile. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiopulmonary auscultation normal. Painful abdomen on palpation in the left flank, with haematoma in the wall at the level of the lower abdomen. No peritoneal irritation. Extremities with signs of chronic venous insufficiency, minimal malleolar oedema, symmetrical pulses  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS During admission for rapid atrial fibrillation: CBC: Hb 14.5, leukocytes 7200, platelets 283,000, INR 3.5, Cr 0.8, Na 141, K 4.9, PCR negative. We reviewed previous INR with very fluctuating values. ECG: atrial fibrillation at 170 bpm, narrow QRS, normal axis, no evidence of enlargement or overload. Transesophageal echocardiogram: mobile thrombus in the left atrial appendage measuring 2.0 x 1.3 cm. Mitral valve without stenosis and with moderate insufficiency. Aneurysmal dilatation of the left atrium. Sclerocalcified aortic valve with mild insufficiency. Mild TR allowing an estimated PSAP of 50 mmHg. Preserved biventricular systolic function, without dilatation of cavities. During admission for atrial flutter: Transesophageal echocardiogram: no thrombus in the left atrial appendage except for spontaneous contrast. Degenerative organic mitral lesion causing moderate insufficiency. Moderate tricuspid insufficiency. Dilatation of the left atrium. MR Vmax: 583.3 cm/s, MR GP max: 136.1 mmHg, MR ERO: 0.22 cm2. MRI PISA radius: 0.74 cm. During admission for haematoma of the abdominal wall: Emergency ECG: atrial fibrillation alternating with left atrial flutter with cycle length of 380 msec and variable conduction (2:1 / 1:1). Emergency laboratory tests: Hb 10; Ht 32; leucocytes 6,600; neutrophils 80 %; platelets 192,000; INR 1.2; sodium 140; potassium 5.7; glycaemia 396; creatinine 0.9; urea 42. Abdominal CT scan: anterior abdominal wall haematoma, located in the left anterior rectus muscle, with heterogeneous attenuation, measuring 6 x 8 x 16 cm. Intravenous contrast extravasation is identified in the arterial phase, which increases in the venous phase, compatible with active arterial bleeding dependent on the left inferior epigastric artery.  EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the ICU. Anticoagulation was reversed with vitamin K and prothrombin complex (Octaplex), the bleeding point was embolised by the Interventional Radiology Service, and 2 red blood cell concentrates were transfused, with clinical and haemodynamic stabilisation. During admission, atrial fibrillation alternated with atypical flutter and, given the impossibility of frequency control, Cardiology was notified: the patient was transferred to the Coronary Unit and intravenous atenolol and digoxin were prescribed, but the patient presented new bouts of 200 bpm and symptomatic bradycardia. Anticoagulation was not given for the first two episodes. Subsequently, given the history of bleeding and the high thrombotic risk, a continuous infusion of sodium heparin was started. Once on the ward, apixaban was substituted, initially 2.5 mg every 12 hours, and then the dose was increased to 5 mg every 12 hours. The transesophageal echocardiogram was repeated, again confirming the absence of a thrombus in the atrial appendage. As for the management of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, considering the poor control with medical treatment, AV node ablation and DDDR pacemaker implantation were chosen, which was performed without complications. The patient evolved favourably and was discharged on treatment with apixaban 5 mg/12h, atenolol 50 mg/12h (as an antihypertensive), atorvastatin 20 mg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day and furosemide 40 mg/day. One year later, he presented severe mitral insufficiency with worsening functional class and it was decided to perform surgery to replace the mitral valve with a 27 mm Epic Mitral bioprosthesis, with surgical ligation of the left atrial appendage at the same time.  DIAGNOSIS Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Common atrial flutter with ablation of the tricuspid caval isthmus. Left atrial flutter. Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome. CHADS-VASc: 3 points. HAS-BLED: 4. Moderate rheumatic mitral insufficiency. Valve replacement with biological mitral prosthesis. Thrombus in left atrial appendage, resolved. Surgical ligation of the left atrial appendage. Spontaneous haematoma of the rectum due to bleeding from the left epigastric artery, in relation to anticoagulation with acenocoumarol, with significant anaemia. Embolisation of the left epigastric artery. AV node ablation. Implantation of DDDR pacemaker. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Reason for consultation: chest pain and syncope.  Personal history 37-year-old woman with adverse drug reaction to enantyum and paracetamol (skin rash). Ex-smoker for 4 years (AOD: 25 p/a). Surgical interventions: cervical disc herniation operated on in private clinic at the end of 2012, appendectomy. Family history: father AMI at 38 years of age, subsequent reinfarction, mother AMI at 57 years of age.  Cardiological history: according to the private clinic report provided: October 2010: onset of chest pain and cardiac catheterisation in which there was no evidence of coronary lesions. Patient was asymptomatic after the episode until January 2013, a few months after the cervical hernia operations. Cardiac catheterisation was performed in February 2013: LMCA without lesions, proximal LAD lesion 52%, Cx and CD without lesions. MIBI was performed and small septal ischaemia was reported, so a Biomatrix 11 mm drug-eluting stent was implanted in the LAD. After stent placement, symptoms persisted and catheterisation was repeated in April 2013, with no evidence of new lesions or intra-stent restenosis. LV size and contractility normal Since April, symptoms worsened with fatigue and progressively disabling chest pain on minimal exertion, with lack of response to multiple treatments, at some point sinus tachycardia at 130 bpm and transient LBBB were observed. There is a suspicion of microvascular angina and painful LBBB. EPS was performed with no arrhythmic inducibility and later CMR showed mild ischaemia at the septoapical level. Baseline: since 1 month ago dyspnoea on minimal exertion, unable to lead an active life. Previously active in sporting activities, although he reported long-standing chest discomfort related to exercise without warm-up. Usual treatment: ASA 100 mg 0-1-0, sumial 20 mg 1-1/2-1/2, simvastatin 10 mg 0-0-1.  Present illness A 37-year-old female patient came to the emergency department with syncope in the context of chest pain. On climbing stairs she presented with oppressive central thoracic pain radiating to the jaw and left hemithorax together with dyspnoea with subsequent loss of consciousness lasting seconds. The pain lasted for a total of 5 minutes, subsiding on sitting and at rest. No sphincter relaxation, no tonic-clonic movements and no post-syncopal confusion. For the last month the patient has been experiencing daily chest pain on increasingly less exertion, in the last few days on minimal exertion.  Physical examination Afebrile, HR 55 bpm, BP 119/56 mmHg, Sat(aa) 98%. C and O in all three spheres, quiet cooperative. BEG; NC and NH. Eupneic. ACV: RCR, no murmurs or extratonos, no IY. Palpable and symmetrical pedial pulses, palpable and symmetrical femoral pulses. AR: VCM without superimposed sounds. ABD: soft and depressible, no megaliths, no signs of peritoneal irritation. No murmurs, preserved peristalsis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: Rs at 60 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, isolated negative T in V1. Chest X-ray: CTI within normal limits, Mediastinum not widened, SCF free, no condensation in lung parenchyma. CBC 05/05: leukocytes 6,180 ^3/uL (76 %), Hb 12.6 g/dl, Hto 35.8 %, platelets 213.00 10^3/uL, INR 0.99, D-dimer 149 ng/ml, glucose 88 mg/dl, urea 27 mg/dl, creatinine 0.69 mg/dl, Na 141 mEq/l, K 3.8 mEq/l. Biomarker curve: negative. Admission blood test (06/06): Quick: 81 %, INR: 1.16. Glucose 91 mg/dl, U 22 mg/dl, Cr 0.67 mg/dl, urate 5 mg/dl, TG 65 mg/dl, CT 162 mg/dl (HDL 54, LDL 95), total bili 0.7 mg/dl, GOT/GPT 16/14 u/l, GGT/FAL 15/63 u/l, total prot 63.5 g/l, albumin 38.7 g/l, Na+ 141 mEq/l, K+ 3.8 mEq/l, Cl 108 mmol/l, HbA1c: 4.9 %. Transthoracic echocardiogram (June 2014): overall normal systolic function. Normal sized left ventricle. Normal LV global systolic function. EF 59%. No abnormalities of segmental contraction or longitudinal strain involvement. Diastolic function not assessable due to associated lesions. No LV hypertrophy. Left atrium of normal size. Right ventricle of normal size. Left catheterisation (June 2014): stent in the proximal descending anterior descending artery permeable without hyperplasia or restenosis. Rest of artery without lesions. Circumflex artery and right coronary artery without significant lesions. The ergonovine test was performed. She started at maximum dose with precordial pain without angiographic alterations but electrocardiographically she presented complete AVB with escape rhythm that responded spontaneously to sinus rhythm. Ergometry 09/06/14: Bruce 03:05, maximum HR 171 bpm, maximum BP 150/90, maximum load: 4.8 METS. Normal resting ECG, very limited functional capacity. Conclusions: stress test terminated by fatigue and chest pain, at the end of the first stage without electrical changes. Abnormal tachycardia with standing, at the start of the test HR 130 bpm. Hormones: TSH 0.43 μUI/mL, FT4 1.04 ng/dl, NT-ProBNP 41 pg/mL. Autoimmunity study: LDH 178 u/l, CK 63 U/l, aldolase 3.7 U/l, CRP 0.36 mg/dl, ANA negative, RF < 20 IU/mL, haemolytic capacity CD 78 U/mL.

Pulmonary vascular resistance less than 1 Wood Unit. Conclusions: pulmonary pressures, cardiac output, PCP, PVC, systemic resistances and pulmonary resistances within normality. There is no RV-PA gradient, ruling out pulmonary stenosis. PFR (June 2014): normal, SatO2 unchanged on standing upright. Slight alteration of the MEF. TLM: events: RS with intermittent LBBB at any rate , bouts of sinus tachycardia often detected at 130-140 bpm with standing and from 150 bpm with LBBB conduction. Standing test: with reproducible standing, a disproportionate tachycardia (> 30 bpm of baseline HR, > 150 bpm, sinus tachycardia with or without LBBB) without hypotension, which reproduces his symptoms of weakness, malaise, nausea, pallor, chest discomfort, distal cyanosis with intense asthenia even exacerbated by speech, these symptoms disappear along with the sinus tachycardia rapidly with decubitus.  EVOLUTION The patient is a 37 year old female smoker with a history of moderate disease of a stented vessel in the LAD, the defect observed at rest after the drug is not very suggestive of ischaemia and is more related to her LBBB. No structural heart disease, ventricular function, filling pressures and normal cardiac output. Patent stent. His clinical manifestations and the standing test were diagnostic of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, with very advanced and disabling symptoms. Three lines of pharmacological treatment and progressive desensitisation through exercise were started.  Thus, treatment at discharge consists of: Postural measures, frequent drinking of water, diet with salt. Acetylsalicylic acid: 100 mg, 1 tablet, oral, Co. Fludrocortisone: 0.1 mg, 1 tablet, Oral, De.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 68-year-old male with hypertension, dyslipidaemia and World Health Organisation (WHO) grade 1 obesity. The patient also suffers from type 2 diabetes mellitus, being treated with insulin on a bolus-basal regimen (lantus 60 IU daily), but with suboptimal control (HbA1C 8.6%). He had been an ex-smoker for 3 years with a P/A index of 40. His past history included chronic ischaemic heart disease with three-vessel coronary artery disease revascularised on multiple occasions. He had made his debut in 1998 with an inferior infarction revascularised with primary angioplasty to the right coronary artery, and after a non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in March 2009, percutaneous revascularisation was performed with drug-eluting stents in the anterior descending (DA), native right coronary (CD) and circumflex (Cx) arteries. He had previously been rejected for revascularisation surgery due to poor distal vascular beds. He presented new acute episodes in August 2011, July 2012 and January 2013, with stent implantation in de novo lesions and on one occasion on a restenosis of the stent previously implanted in the proximal Cx. In the intercurrent period, the patient had stable exertional angina, whose threshold had been slowly and progressively shortening despite antianginal treatment until reaching CCS functional class III/IV. In addition, his micro- and macrovascular metadiabetic involvement included polyneuropathy, stage IIIb chronic kidney disease, and chronic lower limb ischaemia with bilateral femoropopliteal occlusion treated percutaneously on several occasions. Finally, in relation to moderate COPD with an exacerbating phenotype and severe SAHS, he was being treated with inhalers, home oxygen 16 hours a day and nocturnal CPAP. He was admitted to Cardiology after surgery for amputation of the 4th and 5th left metatarsophalangeal joints in the context of comprehensive treatment of diabetic foot. Despite the favourable postoperative evolution, the patient presented daily episodes of rest angina triggered by foot pain, poorly controlled despite the use of opioids. Physical examination revealed a good general condition, and the patient was eupneic. Vital signs were: BP 120/60 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, SatO2 with GN at 2 bpm 92 %. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was unremarkable, there was no oedema in the lower limbs and the left 1st and 2nd fingers had established erythrocyanosis, together with necrotic lesions at the apex. The 3rd finger also had a necrotic lesion of 0.5 cm diameter.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm, 1st degree BAV, QRS 110 ms with HBAI, ST rectification in I, aVL, V5-V6, similar to previous ones. No changes with and without pain. Blood tests: Hb 10 g/dl, leucocytes 16,900, platelets and coagulation normal, creatinine 1.65 mg/dl, ions normal, troponin T serum US 26 - 25 (normal < 10 ng/l), CK and CK-MB normal. Echocardiogram: left ventricle not dilated, with slightly increased wall thickness. Inferior basal akinesia and basal and medial segments of inferior lateral face. Hypokinesia of the inferior septum. Ejection fraction at the lower limit of normal (52%). Pseudonormalised transmitral filling pattern. Non-dilated right ventricle, with normal global systolic function. No significant valvular heart disease. Inferior vena cava not dilated with physiological inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. Aortic root not dilated. Coronary angiography: previously implanted patent stents. Multivessel coronary artery disease with poor distal beds, thin calibre and diffuse disease, not subsidiary of new revascularisation.  EVOLUTION Local treatment of the diabetic foot was carried out, the antibiotic cycle was completed and antianginal medication was titrated, and the patient tolerated bisoprolol 10 mg/day, amlodipine 10 mg/day, Uniket retard 50 mg/day, ranolazine 750 mg/12 h and ivabradine 5 mg/12 h. From the analgesic point of view, he is tolerating paracetamol c/8 h, metamizole 1c/8 h, fentanyl patches 75 mcg/72 h, and rescue morphine and sublingual NTG. Despite some symptomatic improvement, he continued to present very limiting mild exertional angina, with peaks of pain in the lower extremities that were difficult to control, requiring constant use of rescue medication. Having ruled out the possibility of further revascularisation, spinal cord stimulation therapy was chosen with two posterior epidural electrodes at cervicothoracic (C7-T4) and lumbar (T9-L2) levels for angina and diabetic foot with chronic ischaemia, respectively. With these devices, a generator was placed in a subcutaneous pocket at left flank level. Subsequent evolution after implantation was favourable, allowing angina-free daily activity at discharge, avoiding intense physical activity and overexertion.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease with mixed percutaneous and surgical revascularisation of three-vessel disease. Diffuse tertiary vessel disease. Refractory angina. Chronic lower limb ischaemia. Diabetic foot. Chronic renal disease. COPD with chronic home oxygen. SAHS with CPAP. Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. HYPERTENSION. Dyslipidaemia. Obesity. In the long-term evolution he had stable angina in CF II-III/IV of the CCS and the need for left infrapopliteal amputation one year later. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 72-year-old woman with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation, anticoagulated with acenocoumarol, without structural heart disease in previous echocardiograms. She consulted for months of chest pain on exertion compatible with typical angina on usual exertion. Acetylsalicylic acid was started and ambulatory exercise testing was requested. No findings on initial physical examination. Admitted for coronary angiography due to ergometry findings.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm, narrow QRS with normal axis, normal repolarisation. Blood tests: biochemistry and haemogram parameters in range. Myocardial damage markers not elevated. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. No mediastinal widening. No acute pleuroparenchymal pathology. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic. Normal segmental contractility and systolic function. Mitral filling with normal pattern for his age. Normal right ventricle and atria. Aneurysm of the interatrial septum without evidence of shunt by Doppler. No significant valvulopathies. Estimated PSP of 21 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Ergometry: stopped at minute 3 of the Bruce protocol due to limiting angina. Clinically positive (anginal chest pain and dyspnoea) from minute 1:30, which becomes limiting at minute 3 and persists on recovery for 3 minutes. Electrically negative to charges reached. No arrhythmias. Normal blood pressure response. Severely limited functional class (4 METS). Coronary angiography: common trunk: no lesions. Anterior descending artery: vessel of good calibre and development, with calcium, without significant stenosis. Bordering the tip. Circumflex artery. Non-dominant, without significant lesions. Right coronary artery: severely calcified from the ostium to the distal segment, with subtotal stenosis at the beginning of the middle segment and distal TIMI 2 flow. The distal vessel receives heterocoronary collateral circulation.  EVOLUTION After performing diagnostic coronary angiography, in the presence of critical stenosis of the right coronary artery with reduced flow, ad hoc angioplasty was decided, administering clopidogrel in the haemodynamics room. An attempt was made to cross the lesion with guidewires with increasing crossing and penetration capacity, given that the lesion behaved like a chronic occlusion (BMW, Miracle 3, Pilot 150 and Confianza Pro). Support is increased with a 1.5F coaxial balloon catheter, but only a false lumen is achieved, causing dissection with an image of contrast retention in the arterial wall, without images suggestive of leakage and with complete occlusion of the artery at the level of the lesion. The patient noted slight precordial pressure which subsided with 2 mg of Cl morphine. No changes were observed in the 12-lead ECG at the end of the procedure. She also presented generalised rash, suggesting allergy to iodinated contrast agent, which appeared to be controlled after administration of intravenous corticosteroid and antihistamine. He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for close monitoring, and an urgent transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing normal biventricular systolic function with no significant findings (highlighting the absence of pericardial effusion). The evolution was favourable, with no recurrence of chest pain, with progressive resolution of the allergic symptoms and with discrete elevation of biomarkers without changes in serum levels, and the patient was transferred to the conventional hospital ward the following day. Neither double antiplatelet therapy nor anticoagulation was suspended, given that the information transmitted was of occlusive coronary dissection and not perforation. Forty-eight hours after the procedure, the patient reported chest pain that initially appeared to have an angina profile, with constants in range, so an ECG was performed with no signs of ischaemia and intravenous NTG perfusion was started, with subsequent arterial hypotension, general malaise and signs of hypoperfusion, which persisted despite withdrawal of NTG. Urgent TTE was performed, showing pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of tamponade, an image suggestive of fibrin deposition at the level of the right AV groove and dyskinesia of the basal portion of the right ventricular free wall. Serum therapy was started, the patient was transferred back to the Coronary Unit and urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with extraction of fluid with a haematic appearance until stabilisation, with subsequent drainage and suspension of antithrombotic treatment. New instability a few hours after placing the pericardial drain, with electromechanical dissociation, with echocardiographic evidence of retapositioning that persisted despite repositioning the drain, with the need for orotracheal intubation due to a low level of consciousness. Cardiac surgery was contacted for urgent surgical pericardial drainage and the time interval was used to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram with the same findings in the right AV groove and basal portion of the RV, without loss of continuity or evidence of flow through the RV myocardium. After pericardial drainage and evacuation of abundant haematic fluid by median sternotomy, a large thrombus was observed adhered to the right AV groove with no active bleeding and haematoma in the basal region of the RV free wall and in the RA, suggestive of dissection of the right AV groove. On leaving the operating theatre, the patient persisted with great haemodynamic instability, so TTE was repeated, ruling out cardiac tamponade but showing severe RV dysfunction with extension of dyskinesia and hyper-refringence to mid-basal portions of the RV free wall, leading to severe systolic dysfunction of the same. Finally, the indication for circulatory assistance was ruled out and it was decided to limit therapeutic effort, and the patient died within a short period of time.  DIAGNOSIS Coronary dissection versus iatrogenic perforation by angioplasty guidewire of the right AV groove. Acute cardiac tamponade. RV free wall haematoma with acute severe dysfunction. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Emergency ECG: ST-segment elevation of V3-V6 and inferior face. Chest X-ray: no signs of HF. No pneumothorax line. Fracture in the 8th right costal arch. Coronary angiography: anterior descending: stenosis of 75% in proximal third with TIMI 3 flow and good distal bed. Stenosis of 90 % in distal third with TIMI flow During admission, the patient remains asymptomatic for angina and dyspnoea, with mechanical rib pain related to a fracture of the 8th costal arch. The patient was discharged home and consultation with Allergology was requested to complete studies. A skin test was performed which was positive, leading to a diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity (immediate, IgE-mediated) to metamizole (NSAID derived from pyrazolone). Furthermore, this mechanism was reaffirmed in vitro, with the induction of basophil activation in response to metamizole stimulation.  DIAGNOSIS Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ST-elevation (STEACS) in the context of anaphylactic reaction in a patient with 1-vessel coronary artery disease: Kounis syndrome type II. Allergy to metamizole (Nolotil). PTCA + 2 PHARMACOACTIVE STENTS in pAD. LVEF 45%.

HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 61-year-old woman, a former smoker, recently diagnosed with LADA type 1 autoimmune diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemic, with a history of spinocerebellar ataxia, who consulted the emergency department due to a non-productive cough and a feeling of dystrophy that had been evolving for days. She was haemodynamically stable, hypertensive (BP 189/114 mmHg), sinus tachycardia at 130 bpm, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 rpm at rest, without tugging, and oxygen saturation of 94% with Ventimask 40%, flapping and afebrile. ECG with sinus rhythm without repolarisation alterations. The physical examination showed evidence of severe bronchospasm on respiratory auscultation and cardiac auscultation with rhythmic twists without murmurs. The rest of the patient had no pathological findings.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Emergency ECG: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, PR 140 ms, narrow QRS QTc 448 ms without repolarisation alterations. ICU ECG: sinus rhythm at 78 bpm, PR 140 ms, narrow QRS, QTc 579 ms diffuse symmetrical negative T waves. ED ABG: pH 7.18; PCO2 79.9 mmHg; PO2 142.3 mmHg; bicarbonate 29.6 mmol/l; BS 1.4; SaO2 98 %. Serial troponin I: 0.12- 1.45-2.51- 3.4- 2.8 ng/ml. Emergency blood tests: creatinine 0.73 mg/dl; urea 54 mg/dl; haemoglobin 13.2 g/dl; haematocrit 42.3 %; leucocytes 23,000/μl; CRP 2.4 mg/dl. Blood tests during admission to Cardiology: highlights: HbA1C 7.1 mg/dl, total cholesterol 172 mg/dl, HDL 49mg/dl, LDL 91.58 mg/dl. Normal thyroid profile; D-Dimer 571 ng/Ml. Chest X-ray in ICU: hilar thickening. Apical redistribution. Transthoracic echocardiography: LV appears normal in size, slightly increased wall thickness, hyperdynamic symmetrical contractility. Normal LVEF. LA of normal size. RV of normal size and function. RA of normal size. IVC of normal size with inspiratory collapse greater than 50%. No pericardial effusion. Aortic root of normal size. VAo trivalva, appears to open correctly. MV with thin leaflets, correct kinetics. Competent. No IT detected. PV visualised subcostal, appears to have normal echostructure and flow. LV findings of normal size and function. LA normal. RV of normal size and function. RA of normal size and function. No significant valvulopathies are appreciated by this study route. Signs of normal PVC. No pericardial effusion. Cardiac magnetic resonance: LV of normal size, normal walls, symmetrical contractility. Normal LVEF. LA normal size. RV of normal size and function. RA of normal size. No significant valvulopathies. Mild pericardial effusion. No evidence of oedema or abnormalities in gadolinium uptake. Catheterisation: right dominance. Coronary arteries without angiographic lesions with normal flow.   EVOLUTION He progressed with progressive respiratory failure and hypertensive crisis, starting intravenous diuretic treatment, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, antibiotic treatment, bronchodilators and intravenous corticoids, and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, with early improvement and early withdrawal of ventilatory support. During his stay with early improvement and withdrawal of ventilatory support, an ECG with diffuse symmetrical T-negatives with elongated QTc and peak troponin 3.4 ng/ml was observed in this context. An echocardiogram was performed showing a slightly hypertrophic LV with preserved EF without clear segmentarism, and the patient was initially referred to STEMI Killip II and started on double antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation. Cardiology was consulted, and given the possibility of type 2 AMI secondary to hypertensive crisis and bronchospasm in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors as opposed to type 1 AMI without clear alterations in the echocardiogram, the patient was referred to Cardiology and it was decided to perform coronary angiography, which showed no coronary lesions. In order to rule out other causes of myocardial necrosis without coronary lesions, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was requested, which was compatible with normality. Since no evidence was found of transient global or segmental ventricular function impairment, it was decided to withdraw double antiplatelet therapy and the most likely diagnosis was type 2 myocardial infarction in the context of respiratory infection with severe bronchospasm. After several days of hospitalisation, she was discharged home without incident.  DIAGNOSIS Respiratory infection with severe bronchospasm. Type 2 myocardial infarction. Absence of coronary lesions. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  A 52-year-old female smoker, with no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia. She was admitted in February 2016 for a syncopal episode without prodrome with cranioencephalic trauma associated with a baseline ECG without alterations and cranial CT scan showing a small focus of subarachnoid haemorrhage in the left parietal and temporal lobes. In November 2016, he was readmitted for sudden recurrent syncope with fracture of the bones of the nose, and an echocardiogram was performed with no abnormalities, an orthostatic test and carotid massage were negative, and a tilt test with mixed response after NTG sl, with dizziness and hypotension with HR 40 bpm, but without loss of consciousness. It was therefore decided to implant a subcutaneous Holter (Reveal LINQ). She came for a Reveal review, after activating it due to an episode of loss of consciousness, while in the washroom preparing to go to work, preceded by a strange, undefined sensation, with a subsequent fall to the floor, with rapid recovery, without sphincter release or tongue biting. Reveal monitoring detected a 15-second pause (with a single wide QRS escape), with no previous tachycardia. The patient was admitted for further investigation. Physical examination showed a good general condition. BP 125/73 mmHg HR 65 bpm. Sat 02 96 %. AC: rhythmic heart tones without murmurs. AR: MVC, without added aggregates. EEII: no oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: urea 38 mg/dl, creatinine 0.63 mg/dl, Na 142 mEq/L, K 3.7 mEq/l, Hb 12.1 g/dl, leukocytes 8,050, platelets 309,000, coagulation within normal limits. Electrocardiogram: RS at 60lpm PR 164 ms narrow QRS, J-point elevation 0.5 mm V3-V6. 24-hour Holter: sinus rhythm throughout the recording at a mean HR of 60 bpm; maximum of 104 bpm and minimum of 49 bpm. Rare isolated supraventricular extrasystoles. No significant pauses, maximum RR 1.33 seconds. Transthoracic echocardiogram: normal. Electrocardiogram after pacemaker implantation: atrial and ventricular pacing rhythm.  EVOLUTION On the cardiology ward, he was kept under continuous monitoring, 24-hour Holter with no evidence of new arrhythmic episodes and an echocardiogram within normal limits. The patient was diagnosed with malignant vasovagal syncope and it was decided to implant a DDD pacemaker, without incident, with correct pacing and sensing thresholds. After an adequate evolution, she was discharged home.  DIAGNOSIS Malignant vasovagal syncope. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 42-year-old woman with hypertension on treatment with enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg/day, dyslipidaemia on treatment with atorvastatin 20 mg/day and a former smoker of 10 packs/year. History of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed at the age of 27 following skin and renal involvement, on chronic treatment with low-dose prednisone (5 mg/day). Class IIIB lupus nephropathy, with biopsy compatible with segmental and focal glomerulonephritis. Positive antiphospholipid antibodies (anti-cardiolipin IgG, anti-cardiolipin IgM, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I and lupus anticoagulant positive). No history of thrombosis or obstetric and gynaecological problems. She consulted the emergency department for two days of symptoms consisting of paraesthesia, pain and coldness in the right foot that worsened with supine decubitus and claudication of gait after 50 m. She also had an episode of dizziness and lightheadedness. In addition, episode of dizziness and sweating without clear chest pain or other symptoms. On examination she was in good general condition. Eupneic. BP 115/75 mmHg, HR 75 bpm. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic, without murmurs or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur. Right lower limb with grade 3 femoral pulse, grade 3 popliteal pulse, without distal pulses. Pallor and coldness of the right foot, venocapillary filling very slow compared to the contralateral one. Mobility and sensitivity preserved. Absence of trophic lesions.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 91 bpm. Normal PR. Narrow QRS, normal axis. Q wave in V1-V5 with negative T wave in V1-V2, flattened in V3-V6. Echo-Doppler right lower limb: occlusion of 2nd portion of popliteal artery with recanalisation in posterior tibial. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle, with normal wall thickness. Apical dyskinesia and akinesia of the distal thirds of all faces; hypokinesia of the middle third of the anterior septum and anterior face. Preserved LVEF (Simpson biplane 55%). Occupation of the apex by a sessile, crescentic mass; first diagnostic possibility: intraventricular thrombus. Mitral valve with a rounded mass of approximately 1 x 1 cm attached to the atrial side of the posterior annulus and the base of the posterior leaflet, causing a very eccentric insufficiency directed towards the interatrial septum. The right ventricle is not dilated, with normal global systolic function. No other valvular heart disease. No pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram: mitral valve with thin leaflets, normal opening. A rounded image of homogeneous echogenicity and well-defined borders is observed, adhering to the atrial side of the posterior portion of the annulus and the base of the posterior leaflet, at the level of the junction of the P2 and P3 festoons, with a maximum diameter of 1.12 cm, indicating II/IV insufficiency. Coronary CT scan: thrombosed dissection of the middle segment of the anterior descending artery, with involvement of the origin of the second diagonal branch. Left intraventricular thrombus. Coronary angiography: right dominance. Disease of a vessel with a long lesion in the middle third of the anterior descending artery compatible with dissection, distal vessel with TIMI 3 flow.  EVOLUTION An initial diagnosis was made of subacute ischaemia of the right lower limb secondary to infrapopliteal thrombosis, which was related to antiphospholipid syndrome. Medical treatment with anticoagulation and prostaglandins was started with a good response. However, the ECG showed anteroseptal QS, which led to a transthoracic echocardiogram with findings of contractility alterations compatible with anterior infarction, apical intraventricular thrombus, and a rounded mass adhered to the mitral valve. A transesophageal echocardiogram with negative blood cultures confirmed the diagnosis of emboligenic Libman-Sacks endocarditis. In addition, coronary CT and coronary angiography showed a long lesion in the middle LAD compatible with spontaneous thrombosed coronary artery dissection. The study was completed with a cerebral MRI which showed small ischaemic lacunar lesions in both cerebral hemispheres and an aneurysm located at the left-sided internal carotid bifurcation. Aggressive treatment of the SLE flare with methylprednisolone pulses, rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil and hydroxychloroquine sulphate and medical treatment of the thromboses with anticoagulation was performed. Asymptomatic at discharge, treatment was started with low doses of beta-blockers. Subsequent follow-up showed good evolution: LV with preserved systolic function, no new episodes of ischaemia, and resolution of the Libman-Sacks endocarditis with disappearance of the mass.  DIAGNOSIS Acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus: Emboligenic Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Left ventricular thrombus. Subacute infrapopliteal ischaemia of the right lower limb. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the anterior descending coronary artery. Evolved anterior myocardial infarction with preserved global ventricular function. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION An 8-month-old infant with no history of interest was referred to the outpatient cardiology department of our centre by her paediatrician after a murmur was found during a check-up. No medical treatment, except for the vitamin D supplement indicated by protocol. The mother reported that the patient presented fatigue during feedings. The patient's staturo-ponderal development was normal and the examination revealed no cyanosis or respiratory tugging; peripheral pulses were preserved and the presence of a systolic murmur in mitral focus II/VI was confirmed.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 150 beats per minute with signs of left chamber enlargement and the consultation echocardiogram showed significant mitral regurgitation (MR), and a regular transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was requested. The TTE showed situs solitus, levocardia, atrioventricular and ventricular-arterial concordance, with a dilated left ventricle after adjusting for weight and height, with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) despite mild inferior hypokinesia: diastolic diameter (DD): 42 mm; systolic diameter (SD) 28 mm; LVEF: 62%. The left atrium was very dilated, with bulging of the interatrial septum towards the right atrium and left-right shunt through the foramen ovale. We observed massive MR due to lack of mitral leaflet coaptation secondary to posterior leaflet retraction with a significant gap between the two leaflets. In addition, both papillary muscles and the chordae tendineae showed increased echogenicity, suggestive of fibroelastosis. During the study of the pulmonary artery (PA) we observed a diastolic flow with colour Doppler at this level, together with the presence of multiple intramyocardial diastolic flows both in the right ventricle and at the septal level. Pulmonary systolic pressure was 30 mmHg. All these findings in the TTE led us to suspect a possible anomalous coronary origin from the PA, and we requested a coronary CT scan. The coronary CT confirmed the suspicion, visualising the left main coronary artery emerging from the PA.  EVOLUTION After the diagnosis of ALCAPA (Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery), also called Bland-White-Garland syndrome, the case was presented at a medical-surgical session, and it was decided to intervene by means of coronary reimplantation and repair surgery on the mitral valve, due to the fact that the lesions present in the mitral valve apparatus visualised with TTE suggested little expectation of improvement after isolated coronary reimplantation. The intervention was performed via sternotomy, confirming the exit of the left main coronary artery from the PA. Resection of the left coronary button with anastomosis to the posterior wall of the ascending aorta and closure of the PA was performed. This was followed by mitral plasty with suturing of the anterior commissure to one third of the mitral valve and suturing of the posterior leaflet pseudo-cleft, the latter probably because the dilatation of the mitral annulus caused excessive separation of the indentations dividing the different scallops of the posterior leaflet. Postoperative TTE showed a significant reduction in MR, from massive to moderate, and in ventricular diameters Our patient evolved favourably during her admission and was discharged 1 week later, remaining asymptomatic during follow-up. The 6-month follow-up TTE showed a marked improvement from baseline, with a significant reduction in ventricular diameters (DD: 31 mm; SD: 21 mm), persistence of a normal LVEF (61%) and reduction in left atrial volume. MR was classified as mild and no significant stenosis was observed after mitral plication (mean transmitral gradient of 4 mmHg). Both PA diastolic flow and intramyocardial flows disappeared, and we found no significant PA gradient.  DIAGNOSIS ALCAPA (Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery or Bland-White-Garland Syndrome). Secondary severe mitral insufficiency. Coronary reimplantation surgery and mitral plasty. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 59-year-old woman with no cardiovascular risk factors with iatrogenic hypothyroidism following thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer on regular treatment with levothyroxine 75 mcg per day. She had no notable family history. The patient came to the Emergency Department because she suffered loss of consciousness while talking on the phone with her sister while they were arguing, without prodromes and with spontaneous recovery in a few seconds. She did not report a vegetative cortex and had a similar episode when descending stairs months earlier. She had no dyspnoea, palpitations or chest pain. On physical examination the patient was conscious, oriented, normal colour, eupneic, without jugular engorgement, BP 120/70 mmHg, 60 beats/minute, peripheral O2 saturation 96% at baseline, afebrile. Cardiopulmonary auscultation showed preserved vesicular murmur with rhythmic tones and no murmurs. In the abdomen there were no megaliths or signs of ascitesis and in the lower limbs there was no oedema with preserved distal pulses and no signs of deep thrombosis. The neurological examination was normal. A blood test was performed in the emergency department, which detected mild anaemia with no other notable findings, a portable chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram. Based on these data, Cardiology was consulted, and an urgent trathoracic echocardiogram was performed, in which no notable anomalies were observed, and the patient was admitted to the hospital ward with monitoring.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: leukocytes 11,500 / mm3, haemoglobin 10.57 g/dl, MCV 87 mm3 , MCH 24/cell, platelets 210,000 / mm3, normal coagulation, creatinine 0.57 mg/dl, urea 34 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate 98 ml/min/1.73 m2, Na 138 mEq/L, K 4.1 mEq/L, Mg 2.6, CPK 140 IU/L, troponin I 0.04 ng/ml. Urine toxins were negative and thyroid profile was normal. Portable chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index not very valuable, without pleural effusion or infiltrates. ECG: sinus rhythm at 72 beats/minute, normal axis, normal PR interval and QRS complex and normal QTc interval QRS complex and QTc interval of approximately 650 ms. Urgent transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle with DDVI of 40 mm without significant hypertrophy, preserved LVEF without segmental alterations of contractility and normal diastolic function with normal diastolic pattern and average E/E" of 6.5. Mitral valve with preserved structure and function. Absence of atrial dilatation. Non-dilated aortic root, normofunctioning trivalve aortic valve. Non-dilated right chambers, normal right ventricular systolic function by TAPSE of 18, absence of tricuspid insufficiency, non-dilated inferior vena cava with inspiratory collapse without pericardial effusion. ECG: sinus rhythm with very prolonged QT interval and polymorphic ventricular triplets initiated with "R over T" phenomenon. Telemetry tracing with torsades de pointes and cardioversion at 100 joules. Chest X-ray: with bicameral implantable cardioverter defibrillator with normal electrode placement. ECG: atrial paced rhythm at 70 beats/minute. There was a reduction in the QT interval with respect to the initial ECG after optimising treatment with beta-blockers.  EVOLUTION On the Cardiology hospital ward, the patient presented with polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles and non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (PSVT). Given these findings, with a baseline sinus rhythm rate of 65 bpm, intravenous magnesium was administered and, in the absence of improvement, the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit. Despite the initial measures, the patient developed sustained ventricular tachycardia of the torsades de pointes type, with loss of consciousness, and cardioversion at 100 joules was performed, which was effective. However, she presented again with non-sustained DVT, so it was decided to perform sedation. The patient showed signs of respiratory distress, arterial hypertension and finally required deep sedoanalgesia and orotracheal intubation. Beta-blockers were started and haemodynamic and arrhythmic stabilisation was achieved, although these drugs were titrated to low doses as the patient presented sinus bradycardia. An analytical study was completed with detection of toxins in urine, which was negative, and a thyroid profile showed no alterations, and the use of drugs that could prolong the QT interval was ruled out. Given the presence of probable congenital long QT syndrome and cardiorespiratory arrest resuscitated by sustained DVT, it was decided to implant a bicameral endovascular automatic defibrillator, which was carried out without incident, and the patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiology ward where the dose of beta-blocker was increased to bisoprolol 5 mg every 8 hours and blood tests were taken for genetic study. This detected a mutation in the KCNQ1 gene in heterozygosis associated with the development of long QT syndrome type 1 with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, and a family study was performed.  DIAGNOSIS Long QT syndrome type 1. Pathogenic mutation in the KCNQ1 gene. Recurrent syncope. Cardiac arrest resuscitated by PSVT. Absence of significant structural heart disease.

HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 55-year-old woman, asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view to date, suddenly started with oppressive chest pain radiating to the left upper limb. The medical history of interest included the presence of arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus, all of them under medical treatment with telmisartan 80 mg/24 h, atorvastatin 20 mg/24 h and metformin 850 mg/24 h, respectively. One year earlier, during a periodic company check-up, an incidental LBBB of the His bundle had been observed, and for this reason a transthoracic cardiac ultrasound had been performed, with no pathological findings. The patient was a non-smoker, had no family history of early ischaemic heart disease and had never undergone surgery or any other medical condition under treatment. Within 30 minutes of the onset of the symptoms, which had been preceded by a heated discussion, the Emergency Services were notified and, after observing the presence of an LBBB in the ECG, they activated the Infarction Code. He was transferred urgently to our hospital (tertiary level) for primary angioplasty. On arrival, the chest pain had disappeared, the blood pressure was 133/70 mmHg and the heart rate was 70 beats per minute, with no evidence of heart failure on physical examination.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS At the urgent coronary angiography, it was decided to first catheterise the right coronary artery with a JR4 diagnostic catheter, with no evidence of atheromatous lesions. The left coronary artery was then catheterised with an EBU3.5 guide catheter, revealing an anterior descending artery without lesions, as well as a fine, diffuse and progressive narrowing of the first obtuse marginal branch (OM1; the only branch of the circumflex territory; involving the two branches into which the artery subsequently bifurcated. Despite the lesion being practically subocclusive at the distal level of the first branch, flow was preserved in both branches (TIMI III). To further diagnose the pathology underlying the coronary finding, it was decided to analyse the vessel with an intracoronary imaging technique, the interventional cardiologist opting for optical coherence tomography (OCT) given its higher spatial resolution. After probing OM1 with two angioplasty guides, progressing the OCT monorail, and analysing the withdrawn artery together with the administration of 16 cc of iodinated contrast, a clear progression of the lumen involvement was evidenced, reaching the circumflex ostium. Despite this, the patient remained asymptomatic, with distal TIMI III flow in all branches, and with the coronary trunk intact. During her hospital admission, a clear ultrasensitive troponin T curve was observed (242 ng/ml to 1,860 ng/ml to 1,691 ng/ml to 800 ng/ml), as well as a reasonably controlled lipid profile (triglycerides 213 mg/dl, total cholesterol 217 mg/dl, HDL 34 mg/dl, LDL 140 mg/dl. Hba1C 6.7%). The rest of the blood tests and chest X-ray were unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiography showed significant akinesia of the OM1-dependent territory, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 %, without other pathological findings. In this sense, the study of myocardial function and its possible sequelae was extended with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which corroborated the presence of mild ventricular dysfunction, as well as the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (of 50 % of the myocardial thickness) in lateral and lateral-inferior aspect.  EVOLUTION Given the angiographic and OCT features of the coronary artery disease, and the fact that the patient was haemodynamically stable and pain-free, it was decided to opt for strictly conservative medical management. Since the patient did not develop new symptoms of ischaemia, and after having tolerated starting carvedilol 6.25 mg/12 h together with dual antiplatelet therapy (ASA and clopidogrel) and the previous dose of ARA-II, the patient was discharged 5 days after admission. Subsequent outpatient follow-up (1 year) showed no new coronary events, and the patient is in NYHA functional class I/IV and without exertional angina.  DIAGNOSIS Acute coronary syndrome in the presence of left bundle branch block. HYPERTENSION. Dyslipidaemia. Type 2 diabetes mellitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Patient aged 22 years, with no known pharmacological allergies and no medical or surgical history. No family history of heart disease or history of sudden death in the family. Habitual sportsman. No toxic habits.  Current illness The patient came to the hospital to have his teeth extracted by means of a scheduled operation in the maxillofacial operating theatre for outpatient surgery. He had been previously assessed by anaesthesia preoperatively, with normal physical examination, blood tests without alterations and ASA I evaluation. No baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed due to his age, in accordance with hospital protocol. During this procedure, the patient presented with a heart rate of around 45-50 beats per minute, and given that this was interpreted as bradycardia, prior to anaesthetic induction, 0.5 mg of atropine was administered as an intravenous bolus. The patient then presented with symptoms of precordial pressure, palpitations and profuse diaphoresis, and the monitor recorded a rhythmic tachycardia with wide QRS at 150-160 beats per minute, compatible with sustained ventricular tachycardia lasting one minute, with spontaneous transition to sinus rhythm. A bolus of 200 mg amiodarone was administered without further episodes.  Physical examination Blood pressure 110/50 mmHg. Heart rate 75 bpm. O2 saturation 100% (FiO2 0.21). Conscious, oriented, normal colour, normohydrated, good distal perfusion. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normal vesicular murmur. Abdomen was nondescript. Extremities without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG (operating room): sinus rhythm at 80 bpm. PR 0.180 msec. Narrow QRS. ST-segment depression in V3-V5 and in III and avF with negative T waves in these same leads. ECG (Emergency): sinus rhythm at 74 bpm, variable PR (between 0.08-0.10) and occasionally retroconducted P wave, some nodal beats. Blood tests: troponin I 0.22 mg/ml. Myoglobin 66. Serialisation: troponin I 2.56. Myoglobin 22. Haemogram without alterations (Hb 15.8 g/dl). Renal function and ions normal. Hepatic profile without alterations. Cholesterol 182 mg/dl. Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV of normal size and wall thickness, with hypertrophy of both papillary muscles. Global LV systolic function normal, without segmental asymmetries of contractility. Diastolic pattern: normal. Left atrium of normal dimensions. Right chambers of normal dimensions; RV normocontractile. Aortic root and visualized portion of proximal ascending aorta of normal dimensions. MV: thin leaflets, not limited in its opening, competent. VAo: trivalve, normal sigmoids, not limited in its opening, competent. IT minimal. IVC not dilated with normal inspiratory collapse. Estimated normal PAPs. Absence of pericardial effusion and intracavitary masses through this access route. Cardiac MRI: left ventricle at the high limit of normality (DTD: 56 mm), with normal systolic function. No hypertrophy or focal areas of late enhancement indicating fibrosis. Mild RV dilatation with normal EF. Non-dilated atria. Minimal MI. Mild TR. Coronary angioCT: coronary arteries with normal anatomical origin. No lesions in epicardial coronary arteries.  EVOLUTION After the episode of self-limited ventricular tachycardia, a 12-lead ECG was performed showing repolarisation alterations suggestive of myocardial ischaemia on the anteroseptal side with subsequent normalisation, although showing competition between sinus rhythm and nodal rhythm. Since the patient had presented with clinical signs of precordial tightness together with the ECG findings described, it was initially treated as an acute coronary syndrome and enzyme serology was performed with peak troponin I of 2.56 ng/dl. Beta-blockers (bisoprolol) were started at low doses. Subsequently, the patient remained asymptomatic with no new episodes of angina, arrhythmias or electrical changes in the electrocardiogram. Given the patient's clinical manifestations compatible with ventricular arrhythmia secondary to a probable acute coronary event, it was decided to admit the patient for further study. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI were requested to rule out underlying cardiomyopathy, as well as coronary angioCT to rule out coronary artery disease. These tests ruled out structural heart disease. The case was discussed with the arrhythmia unit, which performed an electrophysiological study that was negative for induction of ventricular arrhythmias or reentrant arrhythmias and no evidence of accessory pathways. After ruling out structural heart disease and induction of arrhythmias in the electrophysiological study, it was concluded that the ventricular tachycardia presented was secondary to a probable coronary ischaemic event (the patient presented chest tightness with associated vegetative symptoms, clear alterations in the ECG and increased markers of myocardial damage). The ECG alterations described and the elevation of markers of myocardial damage would not be secondary to the ventricular tachycardia as it was of very short duration. Therefore, we believe that the ventricular tachycardia was the secondary event to myocardial ischaemia. Given that the angioCT findings ruled out any structural abnormality that could cause ischaemia, the presence of coronary vasospasm triggered by a sudden change in heart rate in the context of intravenous administration of atropine was proposed as the first diagnostic probability. Since the patient had no cardiovascular risk factors and no clinical history of angina, it was not considered necessary to perform coronary vasospasm provocation studies. Medical treatment with calcium antagonists was not initiated as a clear trigger for the episode was identified. The beta-blockers that had been started were withdrawn as they have been described as a possible trigger for coronary vasospasm. With the results of the complementary tests and the good prognosis of the same, and with a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia in the context of probable coronary vasospasm secondary to the administration of intravenous atropine, hospital discharge was decided for outpatient monitoring without initiating any pharmacological treatment for the time being.

Current illness The patient consults for approximately 1-2 months for episodes of chest pain that usually appear at rest and at night, but sometimes appear after heavy physical exertion. He refers to the pain as oppressive, radiating to the left arm and jaw, with no accompanying vegetative cortex; the duration of the episodes is usually a maximum of 10-15 minutes and they subside spontaneously. In the last week he presented 4 episodes of chest pain and consulted his primary care physician, who referred him to Cardiology for assessment.  Physical examination Vital signs: BP 130/70, HR 70 bpm, O2 saturation 97% on room air. Patient conscious and oriented, normal neurological examination. Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur. Auscultation of heart sounds normal, no murmurs or extratonos, no pericardial friction rub. Neck without jugular ingurgitation. Abdomen without pathological findings. Lower extremities without oedema or signs of thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: glucose 120 mg/dl, urea 30 mg/dl, creatinine 0.85 mg/dl, sodium 142 mEq/l, potassium 4 mEq/l, chlorine 104 mEq/l. Leukocytes 7,500 with 60 % neutrophils, haemoglobin 13.2 g/dl, haematocrit 40 %, platelets 250,000. Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, little R wave growth in right precordial leads. No other repolarisation abnormalities. Chest X-ray: normal cardiac silhouette, no acute pleuroparenchymal findings. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal dimensions, normal wall thickness. Preserved systolic function without segmental alterations of contractility. Normal diastolic pattern. Normal left atrium. Mild mitral insufficiency. Aortic root and aortic valve normal. Normal right chambers. No pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography: right radial access 5F. Cardiac catheterisation: right dominance. Left common trunk (LMCA) without lesions. Anterior descending artery (AD) without lesions. Bisector branch: slight proximal lesion. Circumflex artery (Cx) with slight mid-level lesion. Right coronary artery (RCA) with severe pseudostenosis due to coronary spasm at midlevel that improves completely after administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin. Diagnosis: epicardial coronary arteries without significant hagiographic lesions. Coronary vasospasm of the right coronary artery.   EVOLUTION The patient was assessed in the outpatient cardiology department. At that time he was asymptomatic, the physical examination was normal and the ECG showed no changes in repolarisation. A baseline transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which was normal, with preserved global left ventricular function and no segmental asymmetries of contractility. Since the patient had cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidaemia and smoking) and presented a typical clinical picture of exertional angina, it was decided to request coronary angiography to rule out coronary artery disease. At the time of cardiac catheterisation, the patient was asymptomatic and had no symptoms of angina. The ECG on arrival showed no changes with respect to the previous ones. Blood test parameters were normal. Cardiac catheterisation was performed via the right radial artery. First, LMCA was cannulated with evidence of slight lesions in the bisector branch and proximal Cx. Subsequently, the LMCA was cannulated without complications. After the first contrast injection, a pseudo lesion with the appearance of a severe plaque was detected at the level of the middle LMCA. At that time, the patient reported chest pain similar to the episodes described above and ST segment elevation in lead II of the monitoring. Initially it was thought that the patient had a fixed lesion over which there had been added vasospasm, so it was decided to administer intracoronary nitroglycerine, which progressively improved the angina and the repolarisation alterations on the monitor. After a new contrast injection, complete resolution of the previously observed lesion was observed. In view of the typical angina symptoms and the coronary angiographic findings, the case was labelled as vasospastic angina with severe vasospasm during cardiac catheterisation. Medical treatment with calcium antagonists and long-acting oral nitrates was started, with excellent clinical evolution during follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Vasospastic angina. Right coronary artery spasm triggered by catheter manipulation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 73-year-old male patient with a DDDR pacemaker since 2002 due to complete atrioventricular block (AVB). In November 2014, he was admitted for facial and upper limb oedema with intoxication on decubitus.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS As part of the study, venous Doppler ultrasound was performed, showing complete thrombosis of the brachiocephalic venous trunk with extension to the right axillary and jugular veins. The diagnosis was confirmed by venography which reported thrombosis of the superior vena cava and both brachiocephalic venous axes up to the subclavian veins and collateral drainage through intercostal veins to the azygos vein.  EVOLUTION With a diagnosis of SVCS in relation to pacemaker electrodes (MP), the patient consulted vascular surgery, which dismissed the case due to the impossibility of access for stent implantation in the venous territory. The patient was discharged with diuretic treatment and anticoagulation. He consulted the emergency department on two other occasions due to severe headache and intolerance to decubitus; the family also told us that he had suicidal ideas in relation to his symptoms. The procedure was performed in the operating theatre, under general anaesthesia with invasive monitoring, echocardiographic control and available ECC equipment. Prior to the procedure, the right femoral vein was cannulated leaving a 7F introducer and an epicardial electrode was implanted through a left thoracotomy. This electrode was tunneled to a right suprapectoral neobolla and connected to external stimulation, as the patient was dependent on cardiac stimulation. Subsequently, after careful dissection, the old generator was removed, and using Cook radiofrequency sheaths and Spectranetic mechanical sheaths, the electrodes were extracted in their entirety. Once the extraction was completed and prior to the removal of the sheath, a guidewire was introduced through the sheath and advanced to the right femoral vein. Using the femoral access, balloon angioplasty and implantation of two self-expanding stents in the superior vena cava (Sinus XL 14 x 40 mm, Protégé GPS 9 x 40 mm) and another Gore-Tex® stent (Gore-Viabahn 54 mm) in the innominate vein were performed. Once the stent implantation was completed, an SSI generator was connected to the right suprapectoral neobag. After 24 hours, the patient was discharged to the ward with a notable decrease in the oedema in the sella, and was able to sleep all night in the supine position, which he had not been able to do in recent months. The patient was discharged without complications under anticoagulant treatment.  At the three-month follow-up CT scan, the stents were found to be permeable. At the 6-month check-up, he reported complete recovery of his symptoms and was able to lead a normal life.  DIAGNOSIS Superior vena cava syndrome after MP implantation. Hybrid approach: electrode extraction and venous stent implantation. Epicardial electrode implantation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 73-year-old male with no allergies, ex-smoker, hypertensive, dyslipidaemic, with stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) secondary to obstructive uropathy due to benign prostatic hypertrophy: had refused renal transplant, started peritoneal dialysis (PD) in August 2008 with several infectious complications, discontinuing PD in June 2012 due to partial recovery of renal function (creatinine 4"2 mg/dl and GFR 15 ml/min), and again presenting criteria for restarting renal replacement therapy (RRT) since November 2014 (creatinine 7"61 mg/dl and GFR 7"7 ml/min), which he had refused as he was asymptomatic. Hyperparathyroidism and anaemia secondary to CKD. No cardiac history. He reported poor compliance with pharmacological treatment. Admitted to nephrology in November 2016 with end-stage renal failure and anasarca, requiring placement of a right femoral catheter for urgent haemodialysis and transfusion of red blood cell concentrates due to severe anaemia. Examination on admission: BP 224/92 mmHg, HR 90 bpm. Conscious and oriented. Rhythmic heart tones without murmurs, friction rubs or extratones. Jugular ingurgitation and oedema with fovea up to the genital region, with distal pulses not palpable due to oedema. Tachypnoea with bibasal hypophonesis and decreased vocal transmissions of left predominance. Hepatomegaly.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, 0o axis, with electrical alternation, without repolarisation alterations. Blood tests: glucose 92 mg/dl, urea 291 mg/dl, creatinine 13.1 mg/dl (FG CKD-EPI 3.3 ml/min/1.73 m2), total Ca 8.69 mg/dl, total proteins 7.17 g/dl, Na 141.3 mmol/l, Cl 114 mmol/l. Venous blood gases: pH 7.15, pCO2 25 mmHg, bicarbonate 8.7 mmol/l, EB -18.6 mmol/l. Haemogram: leucocytes 6.46 x109/l (77.9 % neutrophils, 11.1 % lymphocytes), Hb 4.5 g/dl, HtO 14.9 %, MCV 90.3 fl, MCH 27.4 pg, platelets 148,000 x109/l. INR ratio 1.07. Serology: negative for HCV, HBV and HIV. HBV DNA undetectable. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly suggestive of pericardial effusion. Lung parenchyma without congestive signs. Left pleural effusion. Echocardiogram: severely hypertrophied LV with good systolic function and diastolic dysfunction due to poor relaxation. LA severely dilated. Normal right chambers. No significant valvulopathies. Severe global pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of haemodynamic involvement: partial collapse of the free wall of the RA, RV and LA, respiratory variation of mitral filling flow of 41%, dilatation of inferior cava (24 mm) and suprahepatic veins without inspiratory collapse of the former and inspiratory inversion of the diastolic component of the suprahepatic vein Doppler. Bilateral pleural effusion. Pleural fluid: exudate. Proteins 3.9 g/dl (5.84 g/dl in serum), LDH 242 U/l (431 U/l in serum with normal values 208-378). Clear appearance. Red cells 300 cells/mm3, leukocytes 391 cells/mm3 (7 % polymorphonuclear, 93 % mononuclear), glucose 94 mg/dl, ADA 9.2 U/l, CRP 10.7 mg/l, pH 7.45. Negative for malignant cells. Negative cultures. Pericardial fluid: exudate. Proteins 4.1 g/dl (6.78 g/dl in serum), LDH 2313 U/l (456 U/l in serum with normal values 208-378). Haemorrhagic appearance. Red cells 945,100 cells/mm3, leukocytes 44,965 cells/mm3 (2 % mononuclear, 98 % polymorphonuclear), glucose 79.7 mg/dl, ADA 16.2 U/l. Negative for malignant cells. Thoracic-abdominal CT: sheet of pericardial effusion. Left pleural effusion with underlying compressive condensation/atelectasis. Bilateral renal atrophy and hydronephrosis and right renal tumours under study. Bilateral renal cortical micronodules, non-specific.  EVOLUTION Given the suspicion of pericardial effusion on radiological imaging, transthoracic echocardiography was performed, which showed severe pericardial effusion with evidence of haemodynamic compromise but without clinical evidence of tamponade. Initially oriented as probable uremic pericardial effusion, a tunnelled right jugular catheter was placed and haemodialysis was intensified, achieving adequate volume depletion, but without improvement of the pericardial effusion after 12 days. Thoracentesis of the pleural effusion was performed with exudate results, and given the persistence of pericardial effusion despite adequate haemodialysis, it was decided to perform a diagnostic and therapeutic pericardiocentesis. A total drainage of 1400 ml of haematic fluid was obtained, exudate, with abundant leukocytes with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells, no glucose consumption or increase in proteins, elevated LDH and negative cytology for malignant cells. In view of these findings, it was decided to perform a whole body CT scan to screen for occult neoplasia, and two solid tumour-like masses were observed in the right kidney. With regard to the anaemia, gastrointestinal losses, haemolysis or metabolic deficits were ruled out and attributed to CKD, and treatment with darbepoetin was started.  DIAGNOSIS Stage V chronic renal failure due to obstructive uropathy. Malignant pericardial effusion. Severe anaemia secondary to chronic renal disease. Renal neoplasia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Thyroid function: TSH 3.65 mIU/l, T4 0.65 ng/dl. -CBC: red blood cells 4.67 mill/mm3, haemoglobin 14.8 g/dl, haematocrit 43 %, MCV 92 fl, leukocytes 6.6/mm3 (59 % N, 28 % L), platelets 150 /mm3.   Echocardiogram: LV dimensions at the upper limit of normality (taking into account body surface area). Parietal thickness preserved. Global systolic function preserved (57% by Simpson ́s biplanar) and GLS -19%. No clear contractile asymmetries. No conclusive data suggesting LVOT elevation. LA slightly dilated (biplanar volume 36 ml/m2). Normal right chambers. Aortic root of normal size. MV and VAo without alterations. I do not detect IT adequately to estimate PAPs. Absence of pericardial effusion or intracavitary masses by this access route. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): acute myocarditis (LV) with oedema (subepicardial linear hypersignal in middle and apical inferior segments and middle lateral segments) and fibrosis (subepicardial linear late enhancement in basal and middle anterior segments, basal and middle lateral segments, middle and apical inferior segments and middle inferoseptal segment). Moderately dilated left ventricle (DTD: 60 mm); with normal systolic function: (EF 52 %). Normal RV function. Atria not dilated. Mild AI. Electrophysiological study: no significant findings. No evidence of accessory pathway or double nodal pathway. Programmed stimulation does not induce ventricular arrhythmias.  EVOLUTION Since admission, the patient had a favourable evolution with no new episodes of arrhythmias. CMR was performed which showed the existence of myocardial oedema and findings suggestive of acute myocarditis. The case was discussed with the Arrhythmia Unit, which decided to implant a subcutaneous ICD. The EMBLEM MRI model subcutaneous ICD was implanted without complications or incidents. The implanted system was checked for proper functioning. Tolerates ambulation without limitations. Tension levels tended to be on the low limit, so beta-blocker and ARAII treatment was adjusted, with good tolerance, asymptomatic. In a situation of clinical stability it was decided to discharge him from hospital.  DIAGNOSIS Sustained ventricular tachycardia in the context of acute myocarditis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 63-year-old independent woman with no cognitive impairment. Cardiovascular risk factors: smoker, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia under pharmacological treatment with good control. No previous cardiological history or other history of interest. She consulted because, after receiving the news of the death of a relative, she began with generalised malaise associated with abnormal facial movements and slurred speech with difficulty in producing long sentences, the episode lasting about 30 minutes. Hours later, the same symptoms reappeared and she was assessed by the emergency services who referred her to our centre.  Physical examination showed a good level of consciousness, oriented in the three spheres, no meningeal signs. Language not very fluent due to nominative difficulties. She understands and repeats correctly. Normal cranial nerves. Normal campimetry. Facial centred with the rest of the lower pairs normal. Normal long motor, sensory and cerebellar pathways. Skin-plantar reflexes ambiguous. CYC: PVY normal, carotid pulses normal AP: MVC AC: normal. Abdomen normal. Extremities: Normal pulses, no oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests on admission: biochemistry: glucose 87mg/dl, urea 46 mg/dl, creatinine 0.86 mg/dl, sodium 143 mmol/l, potassium 3.8 mmol/l, CRP 1.2mg/dl. Coagulation: PT 87 %, aPTT 1.23 FBN 580mg/dl, INR 1.09. Haemogram: leucocytes 6.99*103 (normal formula), HB 14.2g/dl, 252,000 platelets. ECG: sinus rhythm at 56 bpm, without repolarisation alterations. Cranial CT scan without contrast, urgent: left fronto-opercular hypodense lesion also affecting the anterior region of the insular cortex, with loss of corticosubcortical differentiation compatible with subacute ischaemic lesion. There is no significant mass effect on adjacent structures. In the rest of the parenchyma, no intra- or extra-axial haemorrhages or other ischaemic lesions are identified. Morphology of sulci and ventricles normal for the patient's age. Centred midline. Posterior cranial fossa structures without apparent alterations. No bony lesions were observed. Findings: subacute ischaemic lesion in the anterior superficial territory of the left MCA. Control cranial CT scan at 72 h: appearance of a focus of confluent petechial microhaemorrhage, of nodular morphology and approximately 9 mm in diameter, inside the known ischaemic or subacute frontal and left insular lesion. The latter has slightly increased in size with respect to the previous study, with greater involvement of the left frontal subcortical white matter at the level of the corona radiata. There is no significant mass effect on the surrounding parenchyma, the midline ventricular system. Pineal cystic lesion approximately 9 mm in diameter and with peripheral gross calcification, non-specific and unchanged. The rest of the study showed no significant alterations or changes with respect to the previous one. Conclusions: appearance of a focus of confluent petechial microhaemorrhage, without mass effect, within the lesion of subacute ischaemic profile of the known left MCA territory. Transthoracic echocardiogram 4 days after admission (Video 1 and 2): Normal sized LV with mild concentric hypertrophy. Preserved LVEF. Prolonged relaxation. RV of normal size and function. Left atrium slightly dilated. Mass in the left atrium dependent on the interatrial septum, heterogeneous echogenic density, deflected limits, which prolapses into the ventricle through the mitral valve not generating significant gradient but mild-moderate mitral insufficiency. Impression of myxoma. Normofunctioning aortic valve. Mitral valve with insufficiency generated by prolapse of the atrial mass. Non-dilated IVC. No pericardial effusion.  EVOLUTION A 63-year-old woman attended the emergency department with clinical neurological deficit. An urgent cranial CT scan was performed, showing a subacute ischaemic lesion in the anterior superficial territory of the left MCA. The patient was admitted to the Stroke Unit for routine management. She progressed favourably with complete recovery of the neurological deficit. After 72 hours, a repeat CT scan showed a focus of confluent petechial microhaemorrhage, without mass effect, within the lesion with a known subacute ischaemic profile of the left MCA territory. The echocardiogram showed a mass in the left atrium, dependent on the interatrial septum, with deflected limits, which prolapses through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, causing mild-moderate mitral insufficiency. Given these findings, the case was re-evaluated jointly with the Cardiology, Neurology and Cardiac Surgery Departments; the patient presented a significant surgical risk as a result of the recent stroke with minor haemorrhagic transformation; however, given the characteristics and behaviour of the tumour, with repeated embolisms and given the risk of other complications, it was decided to perform urgent surgery that same day. The atrial mass was excised with resection of the fossa ovalis and reconstruction with a pericardial patch. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative period and was discharged from hospital. The pathological anatomy of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of myxoma.   DIAGNOSIS Left frontal ischaemic stroke. Confluent petechial microhaemorrhage inside the ischaemic profile lesion. Left atrial myxoma. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

No other intoxicants reported. No hypertension, no dyslipidaemia, no diabetes mellitus. No known heart disease. Bronchial asthma treated with inhalers, with 10 flare-ups related to mites and pollen in the last year treated with bronchodilators and auto-injectable adrenaline. Surgical interventions: right knee meniscus 2 years ago. Usual treatment (poor compliance): terbutaline 1 inhalation in the mornings. Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 every 24 hours. Family history: father with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at the age of 52.  Present illness A 21-year-old man, with the history described above, presented to his health centre with a sensation of chest tightness and sudden onset of dyspnoea. The report highlights: inspiratory stridor and BP 80/55. Intravenous methylprednisolone 80 mg and an ampoule of adrenaline 1 mg/ml intramuscular were administered, with improvement of the respiratory symptoms, but he presented with precordial pressure radiating to the neck. An ECG was performed showing an inferoposterolateral subepicardial lesion. Sublingual nitroglycerine was administered without clinical or electrocardiographic improvement, so the Emergency Services were notified and he was transferred to our hospital. On arrival (30 minutes after the onset of pain), he reported a slight improvement in pain, although ST-segment elevation persisted, so the patient was transferred to the haemodynamics room for urgent catheterisation, and coronary arteries were found to have no significant lesions.

EVOLUTION This is a 21-year-old male, allergic to mites and grasses, smoker, asthmatic with several annual crises requiring emergency department visits and administration of intravenous corticosteroids and intramuscular adrenaline, who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit of our hospital due to infero-posterior STEACS in relation to an anaphylactic reaction with severe bronchospasm and hypotension, with no clear trigger (probably environmental factor). The patient required administration of intravenous methylprednisolone and intramuscular adrenaline, improving the respiratory symptoms, but subepicardial lesion persisted despite sublingual nitroglycerine. An urgent coronary angiography was therefore performed without significant lesions. The picture was interpreted as a possible Kounis Syndrome. The Allergy Department assessed the patient with altered tryptase serology and elevated immunoglobulins and eosinophilia, and concluded that the symptoms were due to an immunoallergic mechanism, all of which was compatible with Kounis syndrome. Allergic tests were positive for environmental factors, mites and pollen, as possible triggers. He presented an enzymatic peak of 250 CK with troponin 3,500 with an initial TTE with a subsequent basal and mean hypokinesia that resolved on discharge. The patient was treated with acetylsalicylic acid, amlodipine, corticotherapy in a descending pattern and antihistamines with good clinical evolution, with no new episodes of chest pain. Cardiac MRI was requested, which showed good contractility, preserved fraction and absence of late enhancement in viability sequences. Given the good evolution, the patient was discharged on the seventh day after admission.  DIAGNOSIS Kounis syndrome (allergic vasospastic angina). Anaphylactic reaction with severe bronchospasm and hypotension. Allergy to mites and pollen. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 70-year-old man, hypertensive with no other personal or family history of interest, was transferred by helicopter by the Emergency Department with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The patient was in an area difficult to access by road and called the Emergency Services referring intense chest pain and nausea. At the time of assessment by Cardiology, the patient was cloudy, haemodynamically unstable (BP 70/40), poorly perfused and with severe chest pain. On cardiac auscultation, no murmurs were heard and the tones were muffled. Pulmonary auscultation revealed no extra sounds. No peripheral pulses are palpable.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation of 5 mm V2-V6, I, aVL, II, III and aVF with ST-segment elevation in V1 and aVR. Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV without apparent contractility alterations. A flap from the aorta is observed in the ventricular cavity, with moderate aortic insufficiency, without adequate visualisation of the ascending aorta. The right cavities are normal and there is no pericardial effusion. Angio-CT scan: in the non-contrast phase, linear calcification is identified in the lumen of the aortic arch, as well as calcifications in the lumen of the abdominal aorta cranial to the renal vessels and both common iliac arteries, compatible with atheroma plaques with displacement of the intima and therefore compatible with the suspicion of dissection. Aneurysm of the ascending aorta measuring 5 cm. The lung parenchyma showed interstitial thickening, bilateral infiltrates predominantly in posterior regions and small pleural effusions, suggestive of oedema.  EVOLUTION Given the echocardiographic findings, emergent CT angiography was requested and Cardiac Surgery was notified for possible intervention. Norepinephrine perfusion was started and the patient was immediately transferred to radiology. There he presented with desaturation requiring OTI and then extreme bradycardia which prevented a valid CT angiography. Only non-contrast images were acquired in the arterial phase, which were compatible with the suspicion of dissection of a 5 cm ascending aortic aneurysm, together with pulmonary oedema. The patient rapidly evolves unfavourably, with extreme bradycardia persisting despite advanced resuscitation manoeuvres, which degenerates into asystole and death.  DIAGNOSIS Ascending aortic aneurysm. Acute aortic syndrome with suspected coronary and aortic valve involvement. Evolution to cardiogenic shock and exitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Male, 38 years old, from Morocco. No drug allergies. No medical or surgical history of interest. No toxic habits. No treatment at present. Active baseline life. Works in the countryside. He has been living in Spain for 7 years. The patient comes to the Cardiology Department with very unspecific symptoms. He reported a sensation of "noises in the heart" that appeared at rest. He denies dyspnoea on exertion. He also had no history of chest pain or syncope. Physical examination showed BP 125/ 60 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, good general condition, afebrile, eupneic at rest with baseline O2 saturation 98%. Cardiac auscultation with rhythmic heart sounds, reinforcement of the first sound, mitral opening click and audible diastolic rumble in the apex. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without rales. Abdomen: soft and depressible, not painful on palpation, no masses or organomegaly. Lower limbs: symmetrical paedial pulses present. No oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 62 bpm, PR 0.19 sec, nicked P wave in II, III and aVF and in left precordial leads, non-pathological q wave in aVL, normal ventriculogram. Blood tests: glucose 90 mg/dl. Urea 25 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.88 mg/dl. GOT 23.0. GPT 13.0 g/dl. Total cholesterol 126 mg/dl. Triglycerides 57 mg/dl. HDL cholesterol 45 mg/dl. LDL cholesterol 70 mg/dl. Haemoglobin 16,0 g/dl. Haematocrit 48,3 %. MCV 87.8 fl. Platelets 194.0 10e3/uL. Leukocytes 7.96 10e3/uL; TSH 1.55 IU/ml. Chest X-ray: slightly increased cardiothoracic index. Left atrial enlargement. Slight vascular redistribution. Free costophrenic sinuses. No infiltrates or condensation. Echocardiography: severely dilated left atrium (34 cm2). Normal right atrium. Normal aortic root, ascending aorta and arch. Rheumatic mitral valve with stenosis morphology and low score for valvuloplasty (4, without commissural calcium). Aortic sigmoid aortic valve trivalves, thickened, rheumatic, with slightly reduced opening. Left ventricle slightly dilated (59 mm, 144 ml), normal thickness. Preserved global and segmental LVSF (EF 65%). Normal right ventricle. AIS intact. Pericardium and cava system normal. Doppler: severe mitral stenosis AVE 0.85 cm2 by THP, by planimetry 1.1 cm2, mean gradient 12-14 mmHg). Trivial mitral insufficiency. Mild aortic stenosis (peak gradient 21 mmHg). Aortic insufficiency II/IV (central jet not crossing papillary muscle plane, no diastolic reversal in descending thoracic or abdominal aorta). Trivial tricuspid regurgitation allowing estimation of mild PH (42 mmHg).  EVOLUTION This is a patient with rheumatic valve disease (mainly severe mitral stenosis) with minimal PH. However, he presents with dubious symptoms or symptoms discordant with the severity of MS. Given the characteristics of the valve disease, percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC) would be indicated (valve area 0.85 cm2, favourable anatomical characteristics, ultrasound score < 8, absence of significant calcification or other valve diseases of greater than mild degree). Age is also a factor in favour of PMC, thus postponing valve replacement surgery. We decided to request an exercise ultrasound to evaluate changes in the mitral gradient and pulmonary pressures, which was positive due to the appearance of clinical symptoms and an increase in the mean transmitral gradient to 20 mmHg and pulmonary pressure >60 mmHg. With these results, the case was presented at a medical-surgical session and was accepted for percutaneous mitral commissurotomy. The commissurotomy was performed using an Inoue balloon. By transseptal puncture, the guide wire was advanced from the right atrium to the left ventricle, crossing the mitral valve. The balloon is progressively inflated from distal to proximal, thus adopting an hourglass shape that will serve to anchor the balloon to the valve upon removal. The procedure proceeds without immediate complications. Postoperative echocardiography shows an optimal result with mitral valve area > 1.5 cm2, with no increase in mitral regurgitation. The patient evolved favourably during hospitalisation and was discharged pending review in the outpatient cardiology department to assess progress and tolerance to effort.  DIAGNOSIS Rheumatic polyvalvulopathy: severe mitral stenosis, mild double aortic lesion. Preserved left ventricular systolic function. mild pulmonary hypertension at rest, severe on exertion. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 46-year-old male patient. No cardiovascular risk factors. No known personal cardiological history. No marfanoid habit. Diagnosed with discoid lupus under treatment. Father died of aortic dissection in 2010 at the age of 61, with no history of hypertension or marfanoid habit. Trivalve aortic valve. Two healthy children.  Current disease In view of the father's history, our patient and his sister were referred for a study in 2010. At that time the patient had an aortic root at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva of 39 mm, dilated for his body surface, a trivalve aortic valve and no stigma of Marfan or other syndromic entities, so it was decided to follow up. During the follow-up, a progressive growth of the aortic root was observed. In March 2017, an angio-CT scan was completed, confirming a 46 mm aorta.  Physical examination Height 1.80 m, weight 72 kg, BP 105/59 mmHg (symmetrical in both upper limbs), HR 80 bpm, SatO2 98% on room air. Normal phenotype. CBC: no jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: no superimposed sounds. Abdomen: nondescript. EIA: no malleolar oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Echocardiogram in September 2014: LV not dilated or hypertrophic with normal systolic function. Diastolic pattern of prolonged relaxation. Dilatation of the aortic root with effacement of the sino-tubular junction. Maximum diameter of 43 mm. Aortic root dilatation with normal systolic function. Normofunctioning MV. Normal right chambers. Echocardiogram in September 2016: LA of normal size. LV of normal dimensions, without alterations in segmental contractility and with normal systolic function. Normal filling pressures. Normofunctioning MV. AoV trivalva normofunctioning. RV of normal size and function, without adequate signal for PSAP calculation. Dilated aortic root of 46 mm. No pericardial effusion. Normal vena cava. Analysis: biochemistry: Glc 92 mg/dl. Urea 36 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.95 mg/dl. Na 144 mmol/l. K 4.5 mmol/L, FA 68 U/l. AST 16 U/l. ALT 18 U/l. GGT 22 U/. Haemogram: Hb 14.2 g/dl. Haematocrit 44 %. Leukocytes 6,520/uL with 57 % neutrophils. Platelets 245.000/uL. PT coagulation 86 %. INR 1.11. Fibrinogen 397. Angio-CT of aorta and coronary arteries: trivalve aortic valve. No alterations are observed in the origin of the coronary arteries. The aortic root measures 29.5 x 23.5 mm at the valve annulus, 46 x 42 mm at the sinuses of Valsalva and 40 x 37 mm at the sinotubular junction. The ascending aorta measures 41 x 37.5 mm. The proximal portion of the aortic arch measures 30.5 x 30 mm, the medial portion 28.5 x 25.5 mm and the isthmus 25.5 x 23.5 mm. The descending aorta at the level of the diaphragmatic pillars measures 22 x 20.5 mm. Normal origin of coronary arteries. Coronary arteries without lesions.  EVOLUTION Given the angio-CT findings and measurements together with the family history, once syndromic entities had been ruled out, the patient was framed in the context of aneurysm syndrome and family dissections, and was referred to Cardiac Surgery for surgery. The patient was admitted on a scheduled basis for aortic root and ascending aorta replacement with a 34 mm tube with aortic valve reimplantation according to David's technique. Immediate postoperative evolution was favourable, with no notable incidents or complications. The post-surgery echocardiogram showed a 33 mm aortic root with correct valve function. The anatomopathological study of the aortic fragment analysed showed a thinned elastic lamina with myxoid degeneration of the media. Finally, the patient was discharged home, pending the results of the genetic study requested.  DIAGNOSIS Ascending aortic aneurysm in an asymptomatic patient with a history of aortic dissection in a first-degree relative. Surgery for aortic root replacement and ascending aorta. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history HBP. Dyslipidaemia. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on OAC treatment. Diagnosed with bladder tumour, TUR performed by the Urology Department. Under outpatient follow-up. She has had a DDDR permanent pacemaker for 2 months due to sinus node disease diagnosed following a syncopal episode. Active fixation electrode.  Current illness Initially admitted to the Pneumology Department due to exertional dyspnoea, asthenia and pleuritic chest pain.  Physical examination BP 110/60 mmHg. HR 90 bpm. SatO2 98 % with nasal goggles at 2 l/min. Cardiac auscultation: R1 and R2 rhythmic and regular, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: hypoventilation in the middle and lower left hemithorax. Abdomen: non-painful, with no signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower extremities: no oedema. Neurological examination: functions preserved.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 75 bpm, BRDHH, HBAS. T-negative lower and lateral face. CBC: leukocytes 6,800/uL with 63.7% neutrophils, Hb 11.5 g/dL, Ht: 33.8%, platelets 255,000/uL, urea 23 mg/dL, creatinine 0.91 mg/dL, Na 142 mEq/L, K 4.3 mEq/L. Chest X-ray: bicameral pacemaker. Significant left pleural effusion. Echocardioscopy: LV of normal dimensions. Preserved LVEF. No apparent segmental alterations of contractility. Normal right cavities with preserved visual contractility. No significant valvulopathies. Absence of pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest: bicameral pacemaker with leads in the right atrium and ventricle. Perforation of the apex of the right ventricle by the ventricular electrode, the end of which is located about 4 cm outside the cardiac contour, is confirmed. There is a small haematoma in the sinus of the cardiophrenic fat. There is no pericardial effusion. There is abundant left pleural effusion, of high density, compatible with haemothorax. No pneumothorax was identified. Partial passive atelectasis of LSI and complete atelectasis of LII.  EVOLUTION Twenty-four hours after admission, he presented dizziness and postural instability without loss of consciousness and chest pain with pleuritic characteristics, for which we requested an assessment. The pacemaker device was checked and failed to sense and stimulate the ventricular electrode. Echocardioscopy without pericardial effusion. Despite the absence of pericardial effusion, due to suspicion of myocardial perforation by the ventricular electrode, an urgent thoracic CT scan was requested and the diagnosis was confirmed. The patient underwent emergency surgery in the operating theatre, and the ventricular electrode was removed percutaneously with repositioning in the RVOT, verifying correct thresholds, sensing and impedance, and the respective chest drain was implanted in the same procedure. The evolution was favourable, with resolution of the haemothorax, correct functioning of the pacing device and asymptomatic at discharge.  DIAGNOSIS Late myocardial perforation of RV apex by pacemaker lead. Reimplantation of ventricular lead in RVOT. Secondary haemothorax resolved on discharge. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Right atrium occupied by a large intracavitary mass. Morphologically normal valves, without dysfunction. Moderate pericardial effusion with dilated inferior vena cava. After administration of a sulphur hexafluoride ecopotentiator, no uptake by the mass was observed. Transesophageal echocardiogram: large intracavitary mass at the level of the right atrium, occupying and filling practically the entire cavity, without reaching the tricuspid valve plane or the atrioventricular groove, with a broad base of implantation at the level of the atrial roof and the interatrial septum, well defined, measuring 8 cm x 6 cm, with very heterogeneous echographic characteristics inside, with large anechoic areas and other dense areas, with an irregular interior appearance. This mass crosses the fossa ovalis towards the left atrium, resting superiorly against the aorta without infiltrating it. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): large mass in the RA (9 x 7 cm), well-defined borders, does not appear to infiltrate the wall or pericardium, relatively homogeneous, appearing isointense on T1 sequences, while on T2-weighted sequences it appears hyperintense. After gadolinium administration, there is an absence of perfusion in the first step and only very slight heterogeneous enhancement in the late phases. Cranio-thorax-abdomen CT scan: well-defined 84 x 99 mm lesion occupying practically the entire right atrium, contacting the uppermost part of the atrium and the interatrial septum, with minimal introduction through the interatrial septum into the left atrium. It contacts the anterior zone of the right pulmonary artery and the right ascending aorta. Persistently hypodense with IV contrast. Large hepatomegaly with areas of uptake, in relation to his known angiomatosis. CT scan of coronary arteries: coronary arteries without lesions.  Pathological anatomy of the tumour: intramyocardial cavernous cavernous haemangioma with papillary endothelial hyperplasia. No signs of malignancy were observed in the material studied. Inguinal adenopathies reactive lymphadenitis.  EVOLUTION Following the clinical manifestations described and the findings on examination, a transthoracic echocardiogram was requested with the results described. After finding evidence of a large tumour in the right atrium, various imaging tests were performed. Without a definitive diagnosis, and with the differential diagnosis of myxoma versus sarcoma, the patient underwent surgery. Resection of the tumour in the right atrium was performed with intraoperative biopsy. The right atrium and interatrial septum were reconstructed with two patches of bovine pericardium. Surgical findings: atrial tumour with a spongy appearance, highly vascularised, with a wide base of implantation in the roof of both atria and the interatrial septum. Small atrial septal defect with respected fossa ovalis. Infiltration only of the interatrial septum, with absence of epicardial infiltration of other structures. An intraoperative biopsy was performed, which showed a tumour formed by inter-anastomosed vascular channels, without cytological atypia with lymphoid aggregates. Vascular tumour of low malignant potential. Postoperative evolution was uneventful, remaining haemodynamically stable and cardiovascular asymptomatic. In subsequent follow-ups, the patient presented paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the rhythm being controlled with flecainide. She remained stable, with no evidence of recurrence in subsequent echocardiograms.  DIAGNOSIS Intramyocardial cavernous haemangioma with papillary endothelial hyperplasia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 64-year-old male, ex-smoker, with a history of long-standing arterial hypertension and suboptimal control, treated with ACE inhibitors and diuretics. He had a heart murmur since childhood, "functional". The first non-invasive imaging study was performed in 2007, due to a radiological finding of cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, in the context of a study of hypertensive crisis in the emergency department. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy without dilatation of the cavity and with good systolic function (ejection fraction 72%). The mitral valve is congenitally defective, with a "parachute" arrangement, anterior leaflet prolapse and single posteromedial papillary muscle. All this leads to a double functional alteration with mild stenosis (effective area 2.5 cm2; mean gradient 4 mmHg) and moderate (III/IV) eccentric insufficiency. The aortic valve is bicuspid, with a slightly restricted antero-posterior opening (intercoronary fusion) (systolic doming; maximum transvalvular gradient of 35 mm Hg and effective area by continuity equation of 1.9 cm2). No diastolic prolapse or regurgitation was observed. The aortic root and ascending aorta are of normal diameters. The right chambers are structurally and functionally normal, with no evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Flow analysis of the abdominal and descending thoracic aorta showed data suggestive of aortic coarctation (diastolic prolongation and gradient in the descending aorta reaching a systolic peak of 107 mmHg). In view of these findings, MRI was requested to assess the suspected aortic alterations. This study confirmed the presence of coarctation of the aorta with stenosis distal to the exit of the left subclavian artery with a minimum diameter of 7 mm (pre-stenosis, 18 mm; post-stenosis, 27 mm). In addition, an aberrant right subclavian artery is observed leaving the area of the coarctation with a retroesophageal course. With a confirmed diagnosis of incomplete Shone's syndrome (parachute mitral valve, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation), the surgical option was considered (2008), which the patient initially rejected due to his good functional status and absence of symptoms. He maintained regular outpatient check-ups for the next four years. However, the progression of the functional grade (grade II) and the appearance of angina made it necessary to go to the emergency department, from where he was admitted to our department (08/2012).  Physical examination Good general condition. Not hydrated, normal colour. Height within normal limits (1.75 cm), with adequate development of limbs and secondary sexual characteristics. Skin without lesions, fragility or bruising. No visual defects or other syndromic stigmata. Blood pressure figures in right upper limb: 160/140, similar to lower limbs, left upper limb: 200/105, heart rate: 90 bpm. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, with pansystolic murmur III/VI aortic with preserved S2; systolic murmur II-III/VI mitral and systodiastolic murmur in the left dorsal region. Abdomen: nondescript, no abdominal murmur. Lower extremities: symmetrical femoral pulses, but less intense than the humeral and radial pulses, pedial pulses present, no oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood count, biochemistry and coagulation: normal. Electrocardiogram. Chest X-ray. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram (14/8/2012): slight dilatation (25 cm2) of the left atrium. Bicuspid aortic valve, with thickening of both leaflets and slight calcification (mainly at the level of the raphe) that homogeneously restricts mobility and causes a moderate reduction in systolic opening, without significant aortic insufficiency. Severe concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle without dilatation of the cavity and with good systolic function. In the left ventricular outflow tract there is a fibrous bundle with a maximum thickness of 9 mm. As a whole (aortic valve and subaortic bundle), there is a severe obstruction to the left ventricular outflow tract (maximum velocity: 4.12 m/s, mean gradient: 41 mmhg). Parachute mitral valve with diffuse thickening of both leaflets and prolapse of the anterior leaflet, leading to severe mitral insufficiency (IV/IV) directed eccentrically and with Coanda effect towards the posterior and lateral wall of the left atrium; the regurgitant jet enters the pulmonary veins and reverses the systolic component of the antegrade flow. Descending thoracic aorta with post-stromal narrowing and acceleration of systolic flow as evidenced by colour Doppler. Doppler analysis shows a pattern of systolic acceleration with a peak gradient of 80 mmHg, without diastolic prolongation. Coronary angiography (performed via the right femoral artery due to the impossibility of progression to the radial access): left coronary tree without lesions. Severe proximal stenosis of the right coronary artery. Aberrant right subclavian artery with retroesophageal trajectory from descending aorta (distal to coarctation). Pressures in ascending aorta 166/73 and descending aorta 104/64. Angio-CT scan of thoracic aorta: aortic coarctation immediately distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, with a diameter of 9.5 x 12 mm at the narrowest point. Anatomical variant of aberrant right subclavian artery originating distal to the coarctation, with a clearly smaller calibre than the left subclavian artery. There is no visualisation of intercostal artery hypertrophy. There is some hypertrophy of the left mammary artery. Renal artery aneurysms, the largest of which is 10 mm in diameter, with calcium and mural thrombus. Bilateral simple renal cysts. Calcifications in the aortic valve.  EVOLUTION Given that the hypertension was severe, treatment was started with calcium antagonists, ARAII, beta-blockers, diuretics, doxazosin, nitrates and antilipemiant drugs. The case was presented at a medical-surgical session and was accepted for surgery. After evaluating the different surgical options, it was finally decided to replace the valve at first, and then to treat the coarctation of the aorta by means of endovascular therapy or surgery. During the entire hospital stay, the patient remained without new episodes of chest pain, with good control of blood pressure, and was discharged with a good functional level. Once the diagnosis and comorbidities had been established, treatment was started, addressing different objectives which, in the present patient, merited adequate control. Severe arterial hypertension is controlled by means of a pharmacological combination that includes calcium antagonists, ARAII, beta-blockers, diuretics and doxazosin. Statins are added as secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease and nitrates for symptomatic relief of angina. It was decided to surgically intervene the different elements that make up this complex congenital heart disease. The approach included initially treating the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (valve replacement and impeller resection) and deferring the approach to the coarctation to a later stage, either by surgery or by percutaneous intervention. On 15/3/2013 he underwent surgery using extracorporeal circulation (total CPB time 171 minutes; ischaemia time 137 minutes) and antegrade and retrograde perfusion. Double valve replacement was performed (metal prosthesis No 23 in supra-annular aortic position and metal prosthesis No 27 in mitral position, without preservation of mitral leaflets) and resection of the subaortic leaflet. In the immediate postoperative period he remained dependent on amines and with complete AV block. He subsequently developed atrial fibrillation associated with right bundle branch block and enzyme peak in the necrosis range (3967 ngr/l), which was interpreted as perioperative infarction, without haemodynamic repercussions. He required blood pressure control with ACE inhibitors and doxazosin to maintain cerebral and splanchnic blood pressure at therapeutic targets (110/70 and 170/80 mmHg, respectively). The control echocardiogram (in sinus rhythm) shows prosthetic normofunction and preserved ejection fraction, so it is possible to be discharged on the tenth postoperative day, with the aforementioned antihypertensive treatment and statins, as well as permanent oral anticoagulation (acenocoumarol). At present, her blood pressure control remains suboptimal and her functional grade (II) limits her daily activities to some extent. He is awaiting percutaneous repair of the coarctation (angioplasty and stent implantation), which was accepted by the medical-surgical team and by the patient at his last outpatient check-up (09/01/2014)  DIAGNOSIS Complex congenital heart disease with serial stenosis of the left ventricle flow: incomplete Shone's syndrome. Single posteromedial papillary muscle. Parachute mitral valve with anterior leaflet prolapse and double lesion: mild stenosis and severe insufficiency. Subaortic stenosis: moderate subvalvular aortic stenosis. Schaeffer's type 1 bicuspid aortic valve: moderate aortic stenosis. Yuxtaductal aortic coarctation (adult type) with severe obstruction to aortic flow. Aberrant right subclavian artery with origin in postductal aorta. Secondary arterial hypertension with suboptimal control. Coronary artery disease with severe stenosis of proximal right coronary artery. Renal artery aneurysms. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Transfer to the emergency department due to deterioration of the level of consciousness and left hemiplegia.  Personal history Allergy to adolonta, metamizol and tramadol. Smoker of 10-20 cigarettes a day. Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty with residual mild rheumatic mitral stenosis. Paroxysmal AF. Depressive syndrome. Usual treatment: sintrom. Mother died of aortic aneurysm.  Physical examination Patient sedated and connected to mechanical ventilation, well adapted. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic, without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur and no added sounds. Left hemiplegia. Positive and symmetrical distal pulses.  Present illness Patient admitted to his hospital of reference for sudden loss of consciousness, accompanied by left hemiplegia. Suspicion of stroke with thromboembolic characteristics led to the activation of the Stroke Code. She was transferred to our centre to complete studies and assess treatment.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Cranial CT scan without intravenous contrast: hypodense lesion affecting the right insular and frontal territory, suggestive of subacute infarction. Angio-CT of supra-aortic trunks and Willis polygon: repletion defect in the M2 branch of the anterior trunk of the right MCA compatible with thrombus. The rest of the intracranial arteries showed no stenosis or repletion defects. Incidentally, an intramural haematoma was observed at the level of the aortic arch, with passage of contrast into the interior, compatible with an unstable penetrating ulcer, so it was decided to complete the study by means of a CT angiography of the thoraco-abdominal aorta. Perfusion CT scan: decrease in flow, increase in mean transit time and decrease in volume affecting almost the entire anterior superficial territory of the right MCA, compatible with subacute infarction. Angio-CT of the thoracoabdominal aorta: intramural haematoma affecting the ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta and extending to the origin of the renal arteries, identifying an aortic ulcer at the level of the arch with active contrast passage, suggestive of unstable haematoma. Bilateral pleural effusion was also observed, more noticeable on the left side. Echocardiogram: severe LA enlargement. Mild non-dilated LVH with preserved EF. Poor diastolic relaxation. Rheumatic mitral valve with mean gradient of 4.7 mmHg. Ascending aorta dilatation of 45 mm. At the level of the sinotubular junction there is an intra-aortic linear image separating two spaces, the smaller posterior one with no lumen inside, which looks like a haematoma. Aortic V. without gradient or insufficiency. Right cavities in the high limit with mild TR and PSAP 28+PVC.  EVOLUTION 65-year-old patient admitted for right hemispheric stroke, in the context of unstable mural haematoma. Given the patient's associated pathology and the surgical risk, emergency surgical treatment was rejected. She was admitted to the ICU, requiring intravenous treatment with antihypertensive drugs and sedation for 48 hours to control her blood pressure. After the sedation period, the patient awoke conscious, with left hemiplegia. The echocardiogram performed after stabilising the patient showed a normofunctioning aortic valve, with the rest of the study similar to that on admission. Haemodynamically, the patient evolved satisfactorily, improving the pulmonary oedema with diuretics and extubation was possible on the tenth day of admission. After the stay in the ICU, the patient was discharged to the hospital ward, where she progressed satisfactorily, without complications. Blood pressure was adequately controlled with beta and alpha blockers. Prior to hospital discharge, a control CT angiography of the thoraco-abdominal aorta was performed, which showed a good evolution of the aortic intramural haematoma, with a reduction in the diameters of the aorta and the mural collection. A small myointimal defect remains adjacent to the origin of the supra-aortic trunks. No alterations were observed at the level of the celiac, superior mesenteric or renal trunks.  DIAGNOSIS Stroke of the right cerebral hemisphere Intramural aortic haematoma in resolution. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 57-year-old woman, active smoker of 10 cigarettes a day with a history of overweight, dyslipidaemia under treatment with statins and ezetimibe, hypothyroidism with replacement therapy and generalised anxiety disorder under follow-up by the mental health unit. She was referred for stress echocardiography with dobutamine because she presented functional class II/IV of the New York Heart Association and moderate effort angina with submaximal ergometry due to weakness in the lower limbs. On physical examination, the patient was in good general condition with auscultation of rhythmic heart tones without murmurs or other findings of interest. The stress test was started. The baseline electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, pr 200 msec, narrow QRS, without repolarisation alterations. The baseline transthoracic echocardiogram showed good global and segmental left ventricular function, with normal wall thickness, no significant valvular heart disease and normal pulmonary artery pressure. During stress echocardiography with maximum dose of dobutamine (40 mcg/kg/min), a paradoxically negative chronotropic response was observed, reaching a bradycardia of 36 bpm. After administration of 0.5 mg atropine, the patient presented chest pain, with ST-segment depression in inferior leads and from V3 to V6 up to 3 mm with ST-segment elevation in AVR and V1-V2 , I and aVL , and moderate left ventricular dysfunction with hypokinesia of the basal segments and LV apical hypercontractility. After administering solinitrine and intravenous metoprolol, the persistence of chest pain and electrocardiographic alterations continued, so an urgent coronary angiography was performed, which showed normal epicardial coronary arteries, without lesions susceptible to revascularisation, with no evidence of coronary vasospasm. Ventriculography showed apical hypercontractility with hypokinesia of basal segments.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Basal electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm, normal pr, left inferior axis, narrow QRS, without repolarisation alterations. Baseline transthoracic echocardiogram: preserved LVEF with no alterations in segmental contractility, no LV dilatation or hypertrophy, no significant valvular heart disease and normal pulmonary artery pressure. Stress echocardiography: Maximum dose of dobutamine is reached with paradoxically negative chronotropic response. After administration of atropine the patient presented chest pain, with electrocardiographic changes. Moderate left ventricular dysfunction with hypokinesia of the basal segments and LV apical hypercontractility. Catheterisation: coronary arteries without lesions susceptible to revascularisation. Ventriculography: apical hypercontractility, hypokinesia of basal segments.  EVOLUTION After cardiac catheterisation, the electrocardiogram evolved to progressive normalisation, the patient remained asymptomatic and a maximum peak troponin level of 1.7 ng/ml (normal value: 0.00-0.16 ng/ml) and a creatine kinase MB mass of 31.79 ng/ml (normal value: 0.00-5.10 ng/ml) was reached. Once on the ward, the dose of beta-blockers was increased with good tolerance and progressive improvement in left ventricular function, and she was discharged one week after admission with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% according to Simpson and no segmental alterations in contractility.  DIAGNOSIS Reverse Tako-tsubo during dobutamine stress echocardiography. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present a 72-year-old patient from Ukraine in an autonomous functional situation with no known drug allergies, with a personal history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and permanent atrial fibrillation. Under home treatment with ramipril 10 mg/24 h, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 h, metformin 850 mg/24 h, fenofibrate 145 mg/24 h and Sintrom 4 mg according to haematology guidelines. She came to the emergency department for repeated presyncopal and syncopal episodes of sudden onset, lasting seconds and with spontaneous recovery, with no apparent sequelae.

Bone marrow aspirate: cytological diagnosis of DLBCL. Flow cytometry: no abnormal immunophenotype lymphocytes with a frequency of more than 1/8,000 cells were detected in this sample.  EVOLUTION This is a patient with the aforementioned history who presented with a right cervical mass of three months' evolution with progressive growth causing dysphagia for solids with a weight loss of 20 kg. She came to the emergency department for repeated abrupt syncopal episodes and atrial fibrillation with significant pauses of up to 5-6 seconds duration was observed on monitoring. Controlled massage of the left carotid sinus reproduced the same symptomatology with a positive cardioinhibitory response with pauses of 4 sec. After discussing the case with Cardiology and Otorhinolaryngology on duty, beta-blocker treatment was suspended and the patient was admitted to the observation room for monitoring and ECG recording, in addition to performing an ultrasound-guided FNA with the aim of identifying the cervical mass to allow therapeutic guidance. During monitoring, the patient suffered new syncopal and presyncopal episodes with bradycardia and significant pauses. FNAUS was performed with inconclusive results. In view of the finding of episodes of symptomatic bradycardia with significant pauses, the patient was diagnosed with peripheral neurocardiogenic syncope secondary to carotid compression by a large cervical mass pending filiation, and was admitted to Cardiology for implantation of a VVIR pacemaker to control the cardioinhibitory reflex. This procedure was carried out without complications, and its correct functioning was checked, being programmed in VVIR at 70/60 beats per minute. Subsequently, beta-blockers were restarted for AF at around 110 beats per minute. After a CT scan, biopsy and anatomopathological study of the cervical mass, Otorhinolaryngology concluded that it was a cervical adenopathic conglomerate with a diagnosis of high-grade diffuse large-cell B lymphoma. The patient was transferred to the haematology department to complete the study and start specific chemotherapy treatment according to the R-CHOP scheme (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, liposomal doxorubicin due to being a cardiac patient, vincristine and prednisone). During admission to haematology, episodes of dyspnoea and dysphagia with good response to corticoids and cytoreduction with cyclophosphamide. Rapid reduction of the cervical mass with symptomatic improvement and no new syncopal episodes. Given the clinical stability, discharge was decided to continue treatment on an outpatient basis.  DIAGNOSIS Cardioinhibitory reflex vasovagal syncope secondary to compression of the carotid sinus by a large cervical mass. Large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, stage II-B, triple-Hit (BCL-2, BCL-6 and C-MYC). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 77-year-old woman, hypertensive and diabetic, with no family history or previous cardiological history. The patient consulted the emergency department of her hospital for an episode of chest pain at rest, of about two hours' duration, accompanied by vegetative crust. She reported symptoms compatible with exertional angina during the previous two weeks, with a progressive drop in the pain threshold. There were no other cardiological symptoms in the anamnesis. An electrocardiogram was performed showing ST-segment elevation in the anterior face, and the haemodynamics department was contacted, and the patient was transferred to our hospital for primary angioplasty. Catheterisation revealed 95% stenosis in the middle LAD (see coronary angiography), which was revascularised by thromboaspiration and implantation of two drug-eluting stents. Subsequent transfer to ICU to continue immediate evolution. On admission, the patient was haemodynamically stable and in good general condition. BP 140/70 HR 90 bpm ACP: rhythmic tones without murmurs. Bladder murmur preserved without pathological sounds. Lower limbs without oedema. No congestive or low output semiology.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on admission to Cardiology: sinus rhythm at 75 bpm. Normal axis. Normal PR. Narrow QRS QS from V1-V4 with significant ST elevation in precordial leads (more pronounced in V3-V4, "tombstone ST") and in inferior face. CBC: blood glucose 140 mg/dl, creatinine 0.90 mg/dl, urea 37 mg/dl, Na 140 mEq/l, K 3 mEq/l, Hb 10 g/dl. Leukocytosis of 14,000 on admission (predominantly polymorphonuclear) which subsequently normalised. Platelets 500,000, normal coagulation. Liver, lipid and thyroid profile without alterations. Glycated Hb 10.7%. Peak TNTUs 1327 ng/L, CPK 227 mU/ml. Coronary angiography: normo-developed anterior descending artery of good calibre, with acute lesion (95 %) in the middle segment, distal vessel TIMI 1 flow, of regular calibre. Rest without significant lesions. Right dominance. Urgent PCI on middle LAD: thromboaspiration with catheter, implanting zotarolimus-eluting stent (2.25 x 18 mm) and another non-consecutive stent-eluting stent (3 x 15 mm). Final TIMI flow 2 improved with intracoronary nitroprusside. Transthoracic echocardiography: left atrium slightly dilated (37 ml/m2). Mitral valve with calcification of the posterior annulus but with thin leaflets and good mobility. Mild central mitral regurgitation. Slightly dilated LV (VTDi 68.23 ml/m2) with 9 mm basal septum and 6.5 mm posterior wall. Mitral filling pattern with E > A and E/e ́ averaged 7. Akinesia of all apical segments with compensatory hypercontractility of the remaining segments and LVEF estimated by Simpson biplane at 65%. An interventricular septal defect was observed at the apical level compatible with VSD. The largest diameter is recorded in more anterior planes (1.3 mm). High velocity flow is achieved with Vmax 4.5 m/sec and mean gradient 42.5 mmHg. Fibrocalcified aortic valve with adequate opening and mild central insufficiency. Non-dilated RV with preserved systolic function (TAPSE 23 mm). Mild IT jet that allows estimating a PAPs of 56-57 mmHG. Non-dilated IVC with adequate inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion Transesophageal echocardiography: in the most apical segment of the septum, which is akinetic, there is a solution of continuity compatible with VSD with high velocity flow passage. This VSD is best defined in more anterior planes of the septum, with diameters of 1.2 cm x 1.9 cm (area > 2 cm2 with friable surrounding tissue). The septal myocardium more proximal to the defect, also akinetic, has a rarefied and hollow appearance. The VSD lacks borders in its distal part, continuing with the more apical myocardium which is very thinned.  EVOLUTION The patient evolves favourably in the first hours after the intervention. Bedside echocardiography showed akinesia in the apical territory and preserved LVEF. The patient was monitored and treatment for acute coronary syndrome was continued. At 12 hours, the patient had a loud systolic murmur, more audible in the left parasternal focus, which was not present on arrival. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out early post-AMI mechanical complications. A solution of continuity was found in the apical interventricular septum with a high velocity left-to-right flow passage. Echocardiography also showed data compatible with pulmonary hypertension. After a diagnosis of ventricular septal defect (VSD), the Cardiac Surgery Department was consulted and, given the clinical context (advanced age in a patient with comorbidity, double antiplatelet therapy and relative stability), emergency surgery was ruled out at that time. The patient remained stable for the next 72 hours and was transferred to the cardiology monitoring unit for further treatment. She initially evolved unfavourably, presenting congestive semiology, so continuous perfusion of furosemide was started. A 24-hour infusion of levosimendan was prescribed, with subsequent improvement.  Repeat transthoracic echocardiography showed a septoapical VSD with a high-speed left-to-right shunt (V max 4.5 m/sec mean gradient 43 mmHg). The RV-AD gradient is 53 mmHg, compatible with at least moderate pulmonary hypertension. Given that there was an indication for VSD closure, and in order to decide on the optimal approach (percutaneous versus surgical), transesophageal echocardiography was requested. A 3D TEE reconstruction of the septal defect (diameter 1.2 x 1.9 cm and area > 2 cm2) was performed. The VSD lacked borders in its distal part, and the myocardium proximal to it was rarefied (friable appearance and with hollows). Given these findings, percutaneous closure was ruled out and the patient was accepted for surgery. Surgery was performed three weeks after the AMI.  DIAGNOSIS Anterior STEMI subjected to primary angioplasty with revascularisation of the culprit lesion in the mid LAD using two drug-eluting stents. Septoapical VSD as an early post-AMI mechanical complication corrected surgically. Akinesia in the apical territory, with preserved LVEF. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 78-year-old woman, independent for basic activities of daily living and without cognitive impairment. She had previously been diagnosed with arterial hypertension, obesity, hypothyroidism and depression. She was being treated with candesartan 8 mg, sertraline 100 mg and levothyroxine 150 mcg. She came to the emergency department for dyspnoea of 2 months' duration, with no clear relationship with exertion. She reported no chest pain, palpitations or other cardiac symptoms. Physical examination: afebrile, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, BP 140/94 mmHg and respiratory rate of 16 rpm. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic and without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: moderate inspiratory stridor. The neurological, abdominal and extremities examination showed no abnormalities.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Biochemistry: Na 141 mEq/L, K 4.2 mEq/L, Cr 0.9 mg/dl, U 43 IU/L, AST 26 IU/L, ALT 31 IU/L. Blood count and coagulation: Hb 12.4 mg/dl, MCV 95 fL, Htco 45 %, Leukocytes 10,203 /ml, PT 97 %. Baseline arterial blood gases: pH 7.35, SatO2 85 %, pO2 55 mmHg, pCO2 32 mmHg. ECG: sinus at 90 bpm. No evidence of ischaemia, conduction disturbances or repolarisation. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. No condensation. Angio-CT of pulmonary arteries: absence of acute PTE. No local complications at the level of the thoracic aorta.  EVOLUTION Given the absence of signs of decompensation due to heart failure and given that the initial tests were not suggestive of structural heart disease, she was initially evaluated by pulmonology due to inspiratory stridor. Bronchoscopy revealed an intermediate tracheobronchomalacia, for which bronchodilator and corticosteroid treatment was started. The evolution was poor, with the patient presenting numerous episodes of dyspnoea and desaturation, mainly when sitting or standing upright. Cardiology consultation was requested. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed: non-dilated left ventricle with preserved systolic function, non-dilated and normofunctioning right ventricle, aneurysmal interatrial septum with right-left bubble passage after infusion of agitated saline, mitral insufficiency grade II/IV, no pericardial effusion or other findings of interest. A catheterisation was requested for a pressure study, with normal pulmonary pressure, interlocking pressure and pressures in the left chambers. During this procedure, an AL2 catheter was passed into the left atrium through the foramen ovale, allowing oximetry samples to be obtained at the central venous level, in the right and left chambers, both in the supine and seated positions. A jump in O2 saturation and pressure was observed between the pulmonary veins and left chambers. Systemic flow was also 26 % higher than pulmonary flow. The patient was referred back to the haemodynamics laboratory for closure of the foramen ovale in a procedure guided by transesophageal echocardiography. A balloon occlusion test was initially performed, showing an increase in supine arterial saturation from 78% to 93%. Subsequently, the patent foramen ovale was closed using an 18 mm Amplatzer ASD device. Control TEE showed a near total reduction of the shunt with correct positioning of the Amplatzer.  DIAGNOSIS Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome. Patent foramen ovale (with occasional right-to-left shunt). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history Independent for ADLs. Lives with daughter. No known drug allergies. Denies toxic habits. She has a history of years of arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia Diabetes mellitus type 2 in treatment with oral antidiabetics. Hypothyroidism on hormone replacement therapy. Ischaemic stroke (2015) in the left MCA territory, of atherothrombotic aetiology, the only sequelae being deviation of the oral commissure. The family reports a benign brain tumour (possible meningioma). Left optic nerve atrophy with secondary decrease in visual acuity  Cardiological history: chronic ischaemic heart disease starting with angina in 2003, with TC and 3-vessel disease. In 2005, double coronary artery bypass from internal mammary artery (IMA) to anterior descending (AD) and from saphenous vein (SV) to right coronary artery (RCA) was performed in another centre. Subsequently new episodes of angina, with coronary angiography (2008): distal coronary trunk (TCd) 75% including ostium of DA and circumflex (CF) (90% in all these lesions), CDp CTO, AMI-DA 100% and VS-DP permeable. PCI was not performed. In 2013, she presented an episode of unstable angina and was studied at the centre where she had undergone surgery, and echocardiography was performed with preserved LVEF and infero-basal akinesia, and coronary angiography was repeated (2013): severe lesion in distal TC and DAp, chronic underocclusion in proximal CF, chronic complete occlusion in proximal CD; occluded AMI-DA graft and patent VS-DP without stenosis. It was considered a bad case for percutaneous revascularisation, opting for medical treatment, as it seems that she has had few symptoms from the cardiological point of view for several years.  Usual medication: ASA 100 mg 1-0-0, atenolol 25 1-0-0, oral nitrates (40 mg) 1-1-1, metformin 850 mg 0-1-0, levothyroxine 75 mcg 1-0-0, atorvastatin 80 mg 0-0-1, enalapril 20 mg 1-0-0.  CURRENT ILLNESS Since 17/04/17 he has had episodes of palpitations, accompanied by oppressive central thoracic pain with irradiation to both upper extremities, without vegetatism, which subside with rest. She has presented daily episodes of chest pain of the same characteristics, some related to small efforts and others at rest, self-limited and of variable duration (up to 2 hours), which remind her of the episodes of angina with which her coronary disease debuted in 2003. On 21/04/17, when she woke up at 9 am, she had another episode of similar pain lasting about 30 minutes, so she consulted the Accident and Emergency department of the corresponding regional hospital. On arrival, the patient was asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable. An ECG was performed with evidence of AF at 69 bpm (not described in previous reports), with unknown LBBB (not described in the 2015 medical report). Troponin I was measured at 1.4 ng/ml (limit of significance 0.04 ng/ml). A 300 mg ASA and 300 mg clopidogrel and 40 mg enoxaparin were administered, and the patient was referred to our centre for admission to the Coronary Unit.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests at the regional hospital: creatinine 1.06 mg/dl. CK 110U/L. Sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 4.8 mEq/L. Chlorine 108 mEq/L. Glucose 178 mg/dl. Lactate 1.82 mmol/L.

HbA1c 8.2 % Control laboratory tests 8 weeks after discharge: HbA1c 7.1 %, GOT 112, GPT 71, GGT 91U/L, FAlc 96. ECG on admission: atrial fibrillation with FVM of 72 bpm, LBBB. Control ECG: sinus rhythm 50 bpm, LBBB, frequent atrial extrasystoles. ECG at discharge: RS at 57 bpm, LBBB. Chest X-ray: silhouette at high limit of normality. Sternotomy sutures. Normal lung fields. Coronary angiography: severe lesion at the level of the distal common trunk. It is a trifurcated trunk (DA-Biscitrus-CX). LAD with significant lesions in the middle third. Distal vessel of small calibre. Significant lesion at the level of the middle-distal third of the bisector branch. Small calibre distal vessel. CX with severe lesion at the level of the proximal third. Critical lesion at the level of the CX-1st OM bifurcation. Small calibre distal vessel. Dominant DC with chronic occlusion at the level of the proximal third. Distal vessel visible from saphenous graft to posterior descending artery. Saphenous graft to posterior descending without significant lesions. No cannulation of mammary graft to LAD (occluded according to previous reports). Echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle, moderate septal hypertrophy, preserved systolic function (EF Simpson 4C 53 %) with akinesia and thinning of mid and basal segments of inferior and inferoseptal face, without other evident alterations of segmental wall contractility. Pseudonormal diastolic pattern. Right ventricle of normal size, preserved function. Left atrium slightly dilated. Normal aortic diameters. Trivalve aortic valve, with thickening and calcification of the base of all leaflets, predominantly the non-coronary leaflet with preserved opening, mild insufficiency. Mitral valve with slightly thickened leaflets, preserved opening, mild central regurgitation (EROA 0.04 cm2, RV 8 ml). Tricuspid valve with mild insufficiency allowing estimation of PSAP of at least 26 mmHg. Non-dilated inferior vena cava with inspiratory collapse > 50%. No pericardial effusion. No intracardiac masses are evident.  EVOLUTION On arrival, she remained asymptomatic. Echoscopy was performed with preserved LVEF. Akinesia of the basal segments of the inferior and inferolateral face and severe hypokinesia of the middle segments of the inferior and inferolateral face. RV with normal morphology and contractility. No significant valvulopathy or pericardial effusion. ECG on admission in AF with controlled FVM, reverting to RS spontaneously at the time of admission. We maintain double antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation (for NSTEACS and paroxysmal AF in patient with CHA2DS2-VASc 8). Tendency to bradycardia, so beta-blockers were suspended and restarted on 24/4 at low doses. ECG persists with LBBB and supraventricular extrasystoles. Peak troponin I 1.9 ng/ml. Tolerates sitting. After reviewing the last coronary angiography, and given the abruptness of the clinical picture with high suspicion of VS bypass lesion/occlusion, it was decided to perform coronary angiography directly without prior ischaemia detection test, which showed similar findings to those found (according to the report from the hospital where the revascularisation surgery was performed) in the study performed in 2013. Haematoma in relation to the radial puncture that is resolved by prolonging the compressive bandage given the clinical stability is discharged to the ward. On the ward it was considered that the infarction could be related to episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, so amiodarone was added and beta-blockers were adjusted. It was decided to optimise medical treatment. An ordinary analysis revealed elevated transaminases, already present in previous analyses, probably related to high doses of statins, so atorvastatin was replaced by pitavastatin. The patient was switched to pitavastatin 4 mg to assess liver enzyme control on an outpatient basis. HbA1c 8.2 % was also noted, so it was decided to start empaglifazone on discharge. Given the history of a possible meningioma and the haematoma of the right arm, it was decided not to start anticoagulation and to assess its initiation on an outpatient basis. She remained stable, with no new episodes of chest pain. She began to ambulate with good tolerance and was discharged from hospital. The patient was seen 8 weeks after hospital discharge and presented CF II, with no new episodes of angina since she had been at home and with a glycated haemoglobin of 7.1%, as well as an improvement in her liver profile.  DIAGNOSIS Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, type 2. Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Coronary artery disease of LMCA and 3 vessels. Carrier of double bypass AMI-DA (occluded) and VS-DP (patent). Ischaemic heart disease with preserved ventricular function. History of ischaemic stroke. Arterial hypertension. Dyslipidaemia.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history No known drug allergies. Ex-smoker for 30 years. Ex-excessive drinker for 3-4 years. CVRF: hypertension, dyslipidaemia. No diabetes mellitus. Studied in May 2015 by the Chest Pain Unit for recurrent chest pain with negative ischaemia detection tests. Previous surgical interventions: appendectomy. Usual treatment: simvastatin 20 mg c/24 hours; enalapril 20 mg c/24 hours.   Current disease Patient with the previously described personal history came to the emergency department of our hospital after starting with oppressive central thoracic pain, radiating to the shoulder and left upper limb, without associated vegetative cortex while he was shaving. Given the persistence of the pain, he decided to sit down, subsequently fainting with sudden loss of consciousness, without prodrome and with associated cranioencephalic traumatism after hitting the floor, recovery ad integrum, without remembering anything of what had happened and without being able to specify the duration as it was not witnessed by anyone. The patient reported that he had previously been awakened by a central thoracic pain of similar characteristics, but of shorter duration and self-limited. He denied worsening of functional class, no orthopnoea or episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. She had not had previous syncopal episodes or chest pain related to exertion or at rest.  Physical examination The patient was stable, in good general condition. Well hydrated and perfused. Eupneic at rest and tolerating decubitus. Afebrile and haemodynamically stable. BP 203/96 mmHg. HR 80 bpm. On auscultation, rhythmic tones, no murmurs. Bladder murmur was preserved, with no other superimposed noises. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, normal axis. PR 160 msec. Narrow QRS, rectified ST segment in V6 already described in previous records. Laboratory tests: biochemistry with renal function, glycaemia and ions in range. Haemogram with values within normality. Serial cardiac enzymes within normal range. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. No images of parenchymal condensation, free costophrenic sinuses. Transthoracic echocardiography: left atrium of normal dimensions. Left ventricle not dilated, normal myocardial thickness. No segmental alterations of contractility are visualised, systolic function by Simpson biplane of 60 %. Trivalve aortic valve with slight fibrosclerosis, opening and mobility of its leaflets preserved. Aortic root not dilated. Mitral valve with thin leaflets and good mobility. Mitral filling pattern with E>A wave. Right chambers not dilated, preserved systolic function (TAPSE 20 mm). Mild tricuspid insufficiency allowing an estimated PAP of 17 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Cardiac catheterisation: left coronary trunk without lesions. Descending artery without lesions with good distal vessel. Circumflex artery without lesions. Very high origin of the right coronary artery with impossibility of selective probing; aortography visualised the proximal, middle and distal segments without disease. Coronary angio-CT: anomaly in the exit of the right coronary artery which instead of leaving the right coronary sinus leaves the medial portion of the left common coronary trunk, following an interarterial path between the pulmonary artery and the ascending aorta to then reach its usual position (malignant coronary anomaly), measuring the maximum calibre at its interarterial passage of 2.5-3 mm to continue with its usual route with a calibre of 4 mm. The rest of the vessels without anomalies. Doppler ultrasound of supra-aortic trunks: non-significant stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Non-significant stenosis of the right external carotid artery.  EVOLUTION Patient with multiple CVRF admitted to our ward for chest pain with a high intermediate pre-test probability of ischaemic heart disease, so it was decided to carry out a test to detect intermediate ischaemia. During his admission the day before the stress test was performed, the patient presented a new episode of chest pain coinciding with high blood pressure figures and documenting electrical changes in the ECG performed, which normalised after the pain subsided, so it was decided to request direct coronary angiography, suspending the exercise stress test. The catheterisation was reported as a left coronary artery without lesions and the inability to probe the right coronary artery due to a very high origin which, given the images, was suggestive of an anomaly of the origin of this coronary artery. Given the findings, it was decided to perform a coronary angio-CT scan to confirm the suspected diagnosis, which documented the anomalous origin of the right coronary artery which, instead of leaving its usual location in the right coronary sinus, has its origin in the left common coronary trunk and then follows a path between both pulmonary arteries and the aorta and then follows its usual path, this being a malignant coronary anomaly. It was decided to present the case at a medical-surgical session to discuss the possibility of surgery for this anomaly, and the patient was accepted. The intervention was carried out during admission, proceeding to dissection and reanostomosis of the right coronary artery to the right coronary sinus with good results and without intraoperative complications. The patient evolved favourably during the postoperative period, without complications related to the intervention and without new episodes of chest pain or other symptoms, and was subsequently discharged home. After hospital discharge and with regular check-ups, the patient remains asymptomatic and in good functional class.  DIAGNOSIS Typical chest pain in a patient with malignant coronary anomaly with origin of the right coronary artery from the left main coronary artery. Surgical intervention with reanastomosis of the right coronary artery to the aortic coronary sinus on the same side. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of an 85-year-old man, in good baseline condition, independent in all activities, with no known medical history, no regular treatment and no recent check-ups. He was completely asymptomatic in the early morning and went to the fields to do his work. He begins with oppressive chest pain but decides not to seek urgent medical attention. Some time later he was found by his relatives who, alarmed by the fact that they also observed some difficulty in speaking and walking, took him to the local health centre. The patient is unable to specify the exact time of evolution from the onset of symptoms, although it could correspond to an interval of 4-5 hours until the first medical contact. On arrival he presented: BP 150/60 mmHg, HR 45 bpm. Afebrile. O2 sat 96% at baseline. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: arrhythmic with ejection systolic murmur suggestive of aortic sclerosis. Bladder murmur preserved without clear crackles. He continued with residual chest discomfort, of lesser intensity.  ECG shows atrial fibrillation at 50 bpm. Normal axis. Little marked ST-segment elevation in II, III and avF, without Q wave. Good R wave growth in precordial leads. During the first assessment, the patient's speech was striking, with difficulty in expressing certain words, and the physical examination revealed haemiparesis of the left limbs. It was decided to transfer the patient to the Emergency Department of the hospital, where the neurologist on duty was notified and an urgent brain CT scan was performed.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on arrival at the Emergency Department: atrial fibrillation at 50 bpm. Normal axis. Little marked ST segment elevation in II, III and avF, without Q wave. Urgent brain CT scan: no signs of intracranial bleeding. There were signs of small vessel encephalopathy, cerebral ageing and lacunar infarcts without evidence of acute extensive ischaemic infarction. Urgent echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle. Mild wall hypertrophy. Global contractility preserved, estimated LVEF 60%. Inferolateral hypokinesia. No pericardial effusion. No aortic root dilatation. Good suprasternal window and no involvement of supra-aortic vessels. CBC: haemogram, ions, renal function in range. Elevation of cardiac markers. First determination of troponin I: 51 ng/ml.  EVOLUTION In the Emergency Department, intravenous nitroglycerine perfusion was started, which almost completely controlled the chest pain. Electrocardiographic findings showed an inferior STEACS in the context of non-anticoagulated AF. Neurological examination showed left hemiparesis 3/5, facial nerve involvement on the same side and ipsilateral positive Babinski. The clinical suspicion was ischaemic stroke of embolic origin. We decided not to administer antiplatelet agents until an imaging test was available. First of all, we transferred the patient for a cranial and thoracic CT scan1 . This confirmed the ischaemic nature of the stroke, ruled out intracranial haemorrhage and possible anomalies of the supra-aortic trunks (dissection type).  Intravenous thrombolysis in the Stroke Code is only recommended in patients seen within 4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms1. At the time of our assessment, the time was longer and did not meet the criteria for mechanical thrombectomy, so no cerebral reperfusion treatment could be carried out. We then performed an urgent echocardiogram where we observed a hypokinesia in the inferolateral face, with no other significant findings. After this, urgent coronary angiography was performed via the femoral artery (radial access was not possible). The images showed angiographically normal left main coronary artery, anterior descending, circumflex and right coronary arteries. A stop was observed at the level of the middle circumflex artery with superior convexity, compatible with coronary embolism. Thromboaspiration was performed, recovering TIMI III flow, with a good final result. There was no angiographic stenosis suggestive of underlying atherosclerotic disease. No stent implantation was necessary. The history of non-anticoagulated embolic AF, the normal coronary angiography and the angiographic appearance of the culprit lesion suggested coronary embolism as the cause of the acute myocardial infarction. The patient was admitted to hospital and 72 hours later a repeat CT scan of the brain showed a new cortico-subcortical hypodensity in the medial aspect of the right temporal lobe in relation to the acute ischaemic stroke in progress, with an intermediate risk of haemorrhagic transformation.  DIAGNOSIS Non-anticoagulated atrial fibrillation. Ischaemic stroke of embolic origin, dependent on the right posterior cerebral artery. STEMI. Coronary embolism in the circumflex territory. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

EVOLUTION Patient aged 44 years with smoking and dyslipidaemia as known risk factors, admitted as a Code Ictus, having received treatment with intravenous fibrinolysis within the protocol, and with evidence of occlusion in left parietal M2 subsequently recanalised. Control neuroimaging studies showed subacute ischaemia of the infarcted territory, as well as petechial haemorrhagic transformation and oedema. At the same time, the patient presented striking alterations in the ECG, with pathological TTE in the emergency department characterised by akinesia of all the apical segments and compensatory hypercontractility of the basal segments with suspicion of probable stress cardiopathy, for which reason CT angiography of the coronary arteries was performed, which showed no significant lesions. The control TTE showed normalisation of segmental contractility. In the aetiological study there was no evidence of a cardioembolic or vascular source with evanescent occlusion of the vessel. In the analytical study, lupus anticoagulant was detected, coinciding chronologically with an active infection at the level of the left ankle. On discharge, lupus anticoagulant and thrombophilia studies by haematology were pending confirmation; antiplatelet treatment and statins were prescribed. As a sequel, she persists with mild mixed dysphasia undergoing speech therapy.  DIAGNOSIS Ischaemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory (M2). Stress cardiomyopathy in relation to acute neurological process. |O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

No personal or family history of heart disease. Usual treatment: amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide 5/50 mg per day.  Current illness In December 2016, he presented with catarrhal symptoms with dry cough, wheezing and dyspnoea on moderate exertion. He was assessed by his primary care doctor, who classified the case as acute bronchitis and started bronchodilators and treatment with levofloxacin in January and February 2017. A chest X-ray in February 2017 showed vascular redistribution, although diuretic treatment was not started. ECG in February 2017 in sinus rhythm with incomplete LBBB. No febrile or infectious symptoms after December 2016. Good blood pressure self-control. Due to progression of dyspnoea, orthopnoea and oedema, she went to the emergency department. Admitted to the cardiology ward for study and treatment of heart failure.  Physical examination Conscious and oriented. Tachypneic and tachycardic. BP 147/73 mmHg, HR 90 bpm. Sat 02 95% with Ventimask at 31%. Jugular ingurgitation and hepatojugular reflux. Cardiac auscultation: tachycardic with gallop rhythm, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: bibasal crackles. ABD: soft and depressible, no masses or megaliths, not painful on palpation, peristalsis present. Lower extremities: pretibial oedema in both extremities. No signs of DVT. Peripheral pulses present.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests on admission: creatinine 0.88 mg/dl, urea 53 mg/dl, K 3.5 mEq/L, Na 144 mEq/L, glucose 126 mg/dl, INR 1.16. Haemogram without alterations. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.54, pCO2 24.2 mmHg, pO2 24.2 mmHg, bicarbonate 21.3 mmol/L, lactate 2.15 mmol/L. ECG: sinus rhythm at 86 bpm. Signs of LA growth. Normal PR. Narrow QRS with incomplete LBBB, lateral negative T wave. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. Signs of vascular redistribution to upper fields. No pleural effusion or pneumonic consolidation. Echocardiogram 21/04/17: LV dilatation with severely depressed function, hypertrabeculation without echocardiographic criteria of non-compaction (suboptimal window). Mild functional MR. Grade II diastolic dysfunction with elevated LVEDP criteria. Dilated RV with mild dysfunction. Mild TR. Normal PAPs (may be underestimated due to RV dysfunction). Minimally elevated PVC signs. No pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography 24/04/17: no angiographic lesions. Cardiac MRI 26/04/17: dilated LV, wall thickness at the lower limit of normality, hypertrabeculation with criteria of non-compaction in the inferolateral wall (ratio non-compacted myocardium: compacted of 4:1) global hypocontractility with severely depressed EF (24.5%). Dilated LA. Dilated RV with depressed function. Dilated RA. Subjectively mild MR. Minimal pericardial effusion. Presence of intramyocardial uptake in basal and middle segments of septal wall and RV insertion. Conclusions: dilated cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction with non-compaction criteria. Intramyocardial septal uptake. Cranial CT 29/04/17: no established ischaemic brain lesions. No acute haemorrhages. Occlusion of the posterior communicating segment (P2) of the right posterior cerebral artery. Cranial CT 30/04/17: established ischaemic lesions at the level of the right temporo-occipital, ipsilateral thalamus and bilateral cerebellar. Small focus of haemorrhagic transformation in the temporo-occipital lesion.  EVOLUTION During admission to the ward, depletive treatment was started, together with beta-blockers, ARAII (intolerance to ACE inhibitors due to cough), eplerenone and ivabradine. An echocardiogram was performed showing cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular dysfunction and hypertrabeculation of the left ventricle, without meeting the criteria for non-compaction with suboptimal window. Laboratory tests with normal thyroid profile, autoimmunity and proteinogram. Normal renal function. Coronary angiography ruled out coronary lesions. Finally, for the aetiological study, cardiac MRI was performed which showed the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction with criteria of non-compaction and intramyocardial septal uptake. Enoxaparin was started at anticoagulant doses (1 mg/kg/12 h). During the evolution of the patient's clinical deterioration, dobutamine perfusion at inotropic doses was started. After several days of treatment, the patient improved and dobutamine was withdrawn and beta-blockers, ARAII and eplerenone were restarted. As a complication during admission, the patient had an ischaemic stroke despite the anticoagulation already started. Fibrinolysis was ruled out as the patient was anticoagulated and thrombectomy was ruled out as the territory was small and with progressive clinical improvement. On discharge the patient was anticoagulated with dabigatran 110 mg/12h for 1 month, after which it was increased to 150 mg/12h as recommended by haematology. He will continue to be monitored in the heart failure unit and neurology consultation.  DIAGNOSIS Debut heart failure. Non-compaction cardiomyopathy with biventricular dysfunction. Ischaemic cerebral vascular accident. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 68-year-old woman, with no known drug allergies, hypertension, with a history of subclinical hypothyroidism, arthritis, osteoporosis, hypermetropia and glaucoma. No family history of interest. For two months she had been experiencing episodes of central thoracic pressure radiating to the left upper extremity (ESI) on exertion, which self-limited spontaneously within a few minutes. On the day of her admission, she went to her health centre for presenting while walking with oppressive precordial pain radiating to the shoulder and LTE, similar to previous episodes but of greater intensity and duration (about 30 minutes). An ECG was performed with pain that showed sinus rhythm with negative T wave in V4-6, I and AVL, for which she was transferred to our centre. On arrival at the ED, BP 194/97 mmHg, HR 108 bpm, O2 saturation 95% baseline, and an ECG was performed even with chest pain, which was similar to that described previously. A few minutes later, after cessation of pain and control of blood pressure, a new ECG was performed in which the described alterations disappeared. In a subsequent control ECG, electrical alterations were again observed, with a negative T wave in V2-6, I and AVL, although the patient remained asymptomatic at that time. Physical examination: conscious and oriented, normohydrated and well perfused. Eupneic at rest with no signs of respiratory work. No IY or other congestive signs. AC: rhythmic around 105 bpm, no murmurs or audible extratonos. PA: normoventilation in all fields. Abdomen was nondescript. LES: no oedema or signs of DVT.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG 1: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, negative T wave in V4-6, I and AVL. ECG 2: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, no repolarisation abnormalities. ECG 3: sinus rhythm at 75 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, negative T wave in V4-V6, I and AVL. Blood tests: troponin I < 0.01 (by 3 determinations). Glucose 103 mg/dl, urea 32 mg/dl, creatinine 0.86 mg/dl, uric acid 5.60 mg/dl, triglycerides 135 mg/dl, serum cholesterol 136 mg/dl, serum HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dl, serum LDL cholesterol (calculated) 73 mg/dl, chloride 102 mEq/L, sodium 141 mEq/L, K 4.6 mEq/L, CK 60 U/L, FA 64 U/L, GGT 19 U/L, GOT 20 U/L, GPT 26 U/L. Leukocytes 8,300/microlitre, Hb 16.4 g/dL, Hto 48.2 %, MCV 90 fl. Platelets 250,000/microlitre. Chest X-ray: normal cardiomediastinal silhouette, without pleuroparenchymal alterations of acute evolution. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated LV, with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Global systolic function preserved, without segmental alterations of contractility. Normal diastolic pattern, with non-elevated LVEDP data. Right chambers of normal dimensions, RV normocontractile (TAPSE 21 mm, S" wave 11 cm/sec). MV thin veils, not limited in its opening, minimal central MI. VAo trivalva, preserved opening without generating significant gradient, competent. Mild TR. Estimated normal PAPs. No pericardial effusion or intracavitary masses by this access route. Coronary angiography: left common trunk without angiographic disease. Anterior descending: intramyocardial bridging in mid-distal segment with significant milking. Rest of the vessel very looped without angiographic disease. Circumflex: very looped vessel, without angiographic disease. Right coronary: dominant. Slight ostial sharpening, which is calcified. Rest of the vessel without angiographic disease. In conclusion: very tortuous coronary arteries without significant angiographic disease and mid-distal LAD with intramyocardial bridging leading to significant milking.  EVOLUTION The physical examination was normal at all times, as were the laboratory tests, and there was no evidence of enzyme elevation compatible with myocardial necrosis. A chest X-ray was performed, showing no radiological alterations of acute evolution, and an echocardiogram was performed with no findings of interest. The clinical picture was interpreted as unstable angina with dynamic electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ischaemia, so the case was discussed with the Intensive Care Unit and, given the patient's haemodynamic stability, it was decided to admit her to Cardiology. The patient was admitted to our department, with continuous monitoring. After 24 hours, coronary angiography showed very tortuous coronary arteries with no significant angiographic disease and mid-distal LAD with intramyocardial bridging leading to significant milking. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout admission, with good control of blood pressure and no arrhythmic events during monitoring. She was discharged after 48 hours with low-dose beta-blocker treatment (emconcor 2.5 mg every 24 hours). The patient has recently been assessed in cardiology consultations, remaining asymptomatic with good functional class, so the prescribed treatment has been maintained.  DIAGNOSIS Chest pain. Coronary arteries without significant angiographic lesions. Intramyocardial tract of the anterior descending artery at mid-distal level with significant milking. Preserved systolic function. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cardiovascular risk factors: arterial hypertension (AHT). Dyslipidaemia. No diabetes.  History Mitral insufficiency diagnosed in 2017 after an episode of heart failure. Intervention in November 2020 with placement of St. Jude No 25 mechanical prosthesis. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Mild-moderate pulmonary hypertension. Mild-moderate stenosis of the middle anterior descending coronary artery. Moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with small bronchiectasis in the right base. Anxious syndrome. Surgical interventions: appendectomy. Intervened caesarean section. Mitral valve replacement. Baseline situation: independent for basic activities of daily living, no cognitive impairment. Lives at home with her husband. Two daughters, one under neurological follow-up for multiple sclerosis, lives independently, and the other with granted dependency due to mental retardation. No orthopnoea. No usual oedema. Treatment: simvastatin 10 mg (1 tablet at dinner), enalapril 5 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), bisoprolol 5 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), amiodarone 200 mg (5 days a week), sintrom 4 mg (total weekly dose 10 mg) 1 tablet at snack, omeprazole 20 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), ferrimanitol ovalbumin 40 mg (1 tablet at lunch), furosemide 40 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), spironolactone 25 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), alprazolam 0.5 mg (1 tablet at bedtime), budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 mg (2 puffs at breakfast and dinner), tiotropium bromide (2 puffs at lunch).  Current illness He presented to the emergency department for an episode of self-limited aphasia and two partial seizures in the left arm and leg (he started with clinical aphasia and later movements in the leg first and then in the arm, accompanied by a sensation of some dysmetry and loss of strength in the right arm). He was admitted to neurology, who, suspecting cardioembolic stroke, requested an echocardiogram to complete the study. Due to an increase in the mean mitral prosthetic gradient (after implantation 3.5 mmHg now 7.7 mmHg), it was decided to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in which he presented two mobile images suggestive of thrombus adhered to the mitral prosthesis. There was no evidence of endocarditis and no previous compatible history. She has not presented fever or shivering, previous infectious symptoms or stigmata of endocarditis. Previous INR values checked since October, all values are below 2.5 and there are even two below 2, so she is referred to cardiology for further evolution and treatment.  Physical examination Afebrile. Blood pressure 136/54 mmHg, heart rate 71 bpm, baseline oxygen saturation 95%. Neck: no jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic. Normal prosthetic sounds. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without crackles. Abdomen: no hepatomegaly. Lower limbs: no oedema. No Janeway lesions or Osler nodules.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Emergency laboratory tests: glucose 119 mg/dl, urea 51 mg/dl, creatinine 0.65 mg/dl, sodium 136 mmol/l, potassium 4.7 mmol/l, ultrasensitive troponin T 11 ng/l, Hb 12 g/dl, platelets 277 x103 /mm3, leukocytes 6.95 x103 /mm3, normal formula. Urinalysis in the emergency department: no significant findings. Emergency ECG: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm. Atrioventricular block (AVB) first degree with PR 240 ms. Normal voltages. T flattened in III, with no other findings. Postero-anterior chest X-ray, ED: sternotomy surgical clips. Metallic prosthesis in mitral position. Calcified atheromas in the aorta. Small ill-defined areas of increased density in the left upper field and right and left midfield, radiologically unspecific, may correspond to inflammatory changes, chronic changes, etc.; in the context of a coronavirus pandemic it is recommended to rule out, with analytical data and PCR, that it is pulmonary involvement by COVID 19. Images of calcium density in right hypochondrium compatible with calcified hepatic granulomas Degenerative changes in the spine and calcifying tendinitis in the right shoulder. Serology and PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirate for COVID 19 negative. Cranial CT: no signs of acute intracranial pathology.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: several lesions were seen. One in the left parietal white matter. Another punctiform on the right side of the pons in the posterior midline. In the superior area of the left cerebellar hemisphere. They show restriction in the diffusion sequence to a greater or lesser degree, do not show oedema or significant mass effect, and show low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 and FLAIR. They are compatible with acute/subacute ischaemic lesions, to be assessed with history (heart disease, etc.). There are no signs of haemorrhage in these lesions. In the T2 gradient-echo sequence, some right medial occipital cortical haemosiderin deposits are observed in the upper area of the left cerebellar hemisphere and the lower area of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Encephalo-ventricular pattern with atrophy correlated with the age of the patient. The Willis polygon shows normal calibre and patency of the main arteries, with less flow through the distal branches of the left middle cerebral artery. Conclusion: multiple supra- and infratentorial ischaemic lesions, acute/subacute. To be assessed with history (image 3).  Laboratory tests on admission: no significant alterations with respect to the ED in terms of acute phase reactants. Renal, liver and lipid profile within normal limits.  Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) 18/01: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with mild concentric hypertrophy, anomalous movement of the septum due to surgery, normal contractility, LVEF Simpson 63%. Mild left atrial dilatation, non-dilated right chambers with normal function. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PSAP) in high normal range estimated at 41 mmHg. Inferior vena cava not dilated with adequate inspiratory collapse. Non-stenotic fibrotic trichomysial fibrosed aortic valve with mild regurgitation. Mechanical mitral prosthesis with normal disc motion, area estimated by hemi-pressure time at 2.3 cm2, mean gradient 7.7 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Aortic root not dilated. Conclusions: mild left ventricular hypertrophy, normofunctioning prosthesis, mild aortic insufficiency.  Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) 19/01: in the presence of a slightly increased mean mitral prosthetic gradient, TEE was performed, showing a non-ligated left atrial appendage, free of thrombus. The interatrial septum was intact. Bidisc mechanical mitral prosthesis with good opening. At around 9 o'clock in the lateral position, seen from the left atrium, a filiform mass of 12 x 4 mm, mobile, prolapsing towards the LV in diastole, echogenicity suggestive of thrombus (no fever) adhered to the atrial side of the prosthetic ring. In the anteromedial portion towards 1-2 h of the clock, a filiform image is visualised adhered to the anteroseptal portion of the ring, measuring 2 x 7 mm, more hyperechogenic, contiguous with the ring tissue, with slight movement towards the LV in diastole. Some calcified atheroma plaque in descending thoracic aorta. Conclusions: mobile image in the posterolateral area of a recent mechanical mitral prosthesis, without significant obstruction, suggestive as a first possibility of thrombus. Mobile hyperechogenic image in anteromedial position. Three small jets of functional intraprosthetic regurgitation.  Blood cultures x3 19/01: only one of them isolated coagulase negative Staphylococcus (Penicillin R, Oxacillin R, Gentamicin S, Clindamycin R, Erythromycin R, Vancomycin S, Cotrimoxazole R; R being resistant and S sensitive) probable contamination.  TEE of control 26/01: mechanical prosthesis that impresses of adequate opening and closing of the discs, 3 narrow jet of prosthetic washout are observed, with a fourth more eccentric compatible with periprosthetic leak at anterior level of the aortic suture (12 h of the clock), which is directed to interatrial septum, reaching the left atrial roof, with decrease of the systolic component in left superior pulmonary vein. Contractile vein of 2 mm and area of the contractile vein in 3D 4 mm2, estimated as moderate grade (not visualised in previous study). As for the image visible in the previous study, it is located in the posterolateral part of the annulus, filiform appearance with movement concordant with the posterior disc, 14 mm long and 4-5 mm wide, which has decreased somewhat with respect to the previous study. Conclusions: moderate eccentric mitral insufficiency (MI) due to periprosthetic leak. Image compatible with thrombus in posterior mitral prosthesis.  Blood cultures x3 27/01: only one of them isolated coagulase-negative Staphylococcus coagulase, with the same antibiogram as the previous one. Probable contamination. Surgical report 31/01: median re-sternotomy. Dissection of pleuropericardial adhesions due to previous surgery. Ascending aorta, single cavoatrial and coronary sinus cannulation. Establishment of extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Aortic clamping. Left atriotomy. Administration of cardioplegia. Explanation of the mitral prosthesis, implantation of a 25 mm Epic mitral prosthesis. Closure of the atriotomy. Administration of enriched warm haematic cardioplegia and aortic declapping. Recovery of spontaneous heartbeat. Warmed to normothermia and disconnected from CPB. Removal of cannulae, haemostasis and neutralisation of heparin. The prosthesis is checked for proper functioning by TEE. No ventricular electrode. Drains: anterior mediastinum and pericardial sac (pericardium is not closed). Incidents: right lung was damaged during dissection, the leak was repaired with tachosil, with good results. Anaesthetic part: induction with etomidate, rocuronium, fentanyl and maintenance with sevoflurane, propofol and rocuronium. Cormack-Lehane I/IV with Burp manoeuvre. Antibiotic prophylaxis with levofloxacin. Need of vasoactive support with noradrenaline and dobutamine at low doses. CPB time 70 min and ischaemia time 52 min. Furosemide 80 mg and continuous insulin perfusion. Tranexamic acid in total 1,360 mg, coagulation monitoring by thromboelastogram and total transfusion of 4 red blood cell concentrates, 1 pool of platelets, 1,500 IU octaplex, and 2 g of fibrinogen (total of around 1,750 cc of inflow). Returned from the operating theatre extubated, with clevidipine perfusion and stable from the respiratory and haemodynamic point of view. Prosthesis microbiology: no pathogen growth. TTE post-surgery 09/02: left ventricle of normal characteristics and function (LVEF 60%). Biological prosthesis in normofunctioning mitral position. Mild tricuspid insufficiency. Estimated PSAP around 41 mmHg. Mild pericardial effusion without repercussions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his admission to the ward he did not present fever and no stigmata of endocarditis were observed. There were no signs of heart failure. In the first days of admission, still in neurology, she presented self-limited episodes of focal seizures, which did not generalise, and which were treated with lamotrigine. Subsequently asymptomatic. A brain MRI was performed which confirmed multiple supra- and infratentorial ischaemic lesions with no signs of bleeding. Although there was no initial evidence of endocarditis, after extraction of x3 blood cultures, empirical antibiotic treatment with vancomycin was started, in addition to anticoagulation with sodium heparin. In the echocardiographic control a week after treatment, one of the possible thrombotic images was significantly reduced in size and the other had practically disappeared. However, a moderate perivalvular leak appeared in the area occupied by the latter. Therefore, despite the absence of inflammation (no leukocytosis, normal procalcitonin, etc.) or clear infection (only growth in one of the blood cultures of a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which was assumed to be possible contamination), the current clinical suspicion is of probable endocarditis added to the valve thrombosis, and cardiac reintervention is decided. Mitral valve replacement with a 25 mm Epic bioprosthesis was performed, with no incidents during the procedure, and the patient was extubated before leaving the operating theatre. Postoperatively, she had spells of AF with RVR with haemodynamic repercussions which were controlled with occasional doses of amiodarone. Subsequently, sintrom was replaced by apixaban. Even with the absence of biological growth in prosthetic material, it was decided to complete treatment with vancomycin for 4 weeks.  DIAGNOSIS Cardioembolic stroke with multiple supra- and infratentorial ischaemic lesions. Focal motor crises without alteration of the level of consciousness secondary to the above. Prosthetic valve thrombosis. Periprosthetic leak with moderate new onset insufficiency. Replacement of the prosthetic valve with a 25 mm Epic biological prosthesis. Preserved biventricular function. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 35-year-old woman with the following personal history: Family history: grandmother died at the age of 86 years due to acute myocardial infarction. Two paternal uncles with chronic ischaemic heart disease at 62 and 73 years of age respectively. Paternal aunt underwent aortic valve replacement at the age of 75. Cousin with congenital heart disease that he cannot specify. Father under follow-up for chest pain, with coronary angiography without lesions at 64 years of age. No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: smoker of 5 cigarettes per day (3.8 packs per year). No hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidaemia. No previous cardiological history. No other medical or surgical illnesses. Baseline: sedentary lifestyle, but no symptoms related to physical activity. No chronic home treatment.  She consulted the emergency department for having presented that same afternoon, while seated, with syncope lasting about 20 seconds, with a sensation of palpitations and previous chest discomfort. After regaining consciousness, she reported chest discomfort, nausea, headache and general weakness. No sphincter release and complete spontaneous recovery.  In the anamnesis, she reported a very similar episode two or three weeks earlier, with the same characteristics, also at rest, while lying in bed, preceded by a vegetative cortex. Since then, she reports having noticed isolated, self-limited episodes of palpitations with sudden onset and end. She denies any other clinical manifestations in recent weeks, or the use of drugs or other substances.  On arrival at the hospital, the patient was asymptomatic and without neurological focality. Haemodynamically stable (blood pressure 120/75 mmHg, heart rate 70 bpm, baseline oxygen saturation 100%). Oriented and cooperative. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, non-painful, no masses or megaliths. Lower limbs: no oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: creatinine 0.6 mg/dl, potassium 3.7 mEq/l, sodium 136 mEq/l, haemoglobin 11.8 g/dl, haematocrit 36%, leucocytes 9000/ml, platelets 159000/mm3. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 65 bpm, normal axis, normal PR, narrow QRS, no repolarisation abnormalities. No serial ECG changes. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. Free costophrenic sinuses. No infiltrates were observed. Normal mediastinum. Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle (LV) of normal size, thickness and systolic and diastolic function. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size and function. Left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) of normal size. No valvular heart disease. No indirect signs of PAH. Aortic root of normal size. No pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI: ventricles with preserved morphology and systolic function. No oedema or myocardial fibrosis/necrosis. Telemetry (24 h): sinus rhythm. Ventricular extrasystoles (VE) of moderate monotopic density with very short coupling (in the ascending branch of the T) with episodes of doublets and 4 episodes of symptomatic polymorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (PSVT) (palpitations and new syncopal symptoms). Electrophysiological study (EPS) and ablation with navigation system: baseline with moderate-density VS with LBBB morphology and transition in V5, with short coupling period. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the RV is performed with echo-intracardiac. The presence of a prominent moderator band is noteworthy. Activation mapping was performed with greater precocity at the level of the middle portion of the RV free wall, the anatomical point being located inside the cavity. Correlation mapping is also performed by topo-stimulation, with 95% of the morphology reproduced in the moderator band. Radiofrequency applications are performed at this point (40-45 W, 30 ml/min) with an irrigated catheter with a contact sensor, repeatedly inducing intense automatic activity. Subsequently, isoproterenol is administered without the appearance of extrasystoles after 30 minutes of waiting. Ventricular arrhythmia induction test was performed and was negative. Flecainide test: negative.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION After evaluation of the patient by cardiology in the emergency department, despite the normality of the complementary tests (ECG, chest X-ray and laboratory tests), given the characteristics of the syncope that suggest a cardiogenic profile, it was decided to admit the patient for electrocardiographic monitoring and to complete the studies. On admission to the ward, the patient remained stable and with no new syncope. Echocardiography ruled out structural heart disease. During the first hours of monitoring, she had self-limited episodes of palpitations and a new syncopal episode, identical to the previous ones that led to her admission. Telemetry showed isolated low-density VE and episodes of very rapid NSTEVT symptomatic due to the R-over-T phenomenon due to a very short coupling period (240 ms). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and an EPS was programmed with a view to navigation-guided ablation of the focus of the VS with possible origin in the RV moderator band (LBBB morphology, transition in V5, left superior axis and QRS <150 ms). Radiofrequency ablation was performed in the moderator band (BM) guided by the CARTO navigation system, in addition to a flecainide test, which was negative. The morphological study was completed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without alterations. Subsequently, he remained on the cardiology ward for telemetric monitoring without any sustained arrhythmias or clinical incidents. A 24-hour Holter recording 5 days after ablation showed a single isolated PVC in 24 hours. Given the success of the procedure and the absence of induction of ventricular arrhythmias, it was decided to implant a subcutaneous Holter prior to discharge. On review 8 months after ablation, an NSTEVT of 14 beats associated with palpitations was recorded, and implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was proposed, which was carried out without complications. In addition, a genetic study was completed which showed no mutations associated with channelopathies or sudden death. The patient was asymptomatic at subsequent check-ups and had no new events.  DIAGNOSIS Repeated syncope in the context of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia induced by short-coupled ventricular extrasystoles originating in the right ventricular moderator band. Ablation of right ventricular moderator band extrasystoles. ICD implantation for secondary prevention. No structural heart disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 49-year-old male. Cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, very difficult to control, treated with 4 drugs, under follow-up by nephrology. No diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia. No toxic habits. Chronic kidney disease secondary to interstitial nephropathy due to vesicoureteral reflux with the start of haemodialysis at the age of 31 (in 1989), double kidney transplant in 1992 and 2015, both dysfunctional and embolised, currently under study for a new transplant and on haemodialysis. Multiple complications at the level of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) (stenosis, obstruction), currently presents AVF in right upper limb. Multifactorial anaemia being treated with erythropoietin and transfusions. Resistant secondary hyperparathyroidism with renal osteodystrophy and parathyroid adenoma in the right lower lobe.

Present illness After a haemodialysis session, the patient presented with general malaise and palpitations, with haemodynamic stability. The monitor showed wide QRS tachycardia at 150 beats per minute (bpm). A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which was interpreted as sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT), so 4 boluses of 100 mg of procainamide were administered, and the patient progressed to an arrhythmic narrow QRS tachycardia that appeared to be atrial tachycardia and then went into sinus rhythm.   Physical examination Blood pressure 190/100, 70 bpm, saturation 98% baseline. No jugular ingurgitation. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without over-additions. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, systolic murmur II/VI in the apex. Abdomen: soft, non-painful, with renal graft in FID. Lower extremities without oedema. Palpable and symmetrical paedial pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests on admission: Biochemistry: creatinine 4.74 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate 13 ml/min/1.73, uric acid 5.04 mg/dl, triglycerides 109 mg/dl, total cholesterol 112 mg/dl, HDL 30 mg/dl, LDL 60 mg/dl, total BR < 1.20 mg/dl, AST 15 U/l, ALT 13 U/l, GGT 22 U/l, sodium 141 mmol/l, potassium 5.39 mmol/l, magnesium 1.85 mg/dl, inorganic phosphate 6.3 mg/dl, Hb A1c: 3,90%. Albumin 3080 mg/dl. TSH 1.98 peak IU/ml, free T4 1.26 ng/dl. Haemoglobin 9.5 g/dl, MCV 94 fl, MCHC 30.5 g/dl, platelets 204000, leukocytes 5990, neutrophils 3960 (66.2%), lymphocytes 570 (21.2%). Coagulation: PT 12s, ATP 79%, INR 1.17, aPTT 35.9s. Urgent blood gases after tachycardia: pH 7.480, pCO2 41 mmHg, pO2 93 mmHg, sodium 131 mmol/l, potassium 4.7 mmol/l, bicarbonate 40.5 mmol/l, oxygen saturation 97.8%. Chest X-ray on admission: normal cardiothoracic index with no signs of congestion or costophrenic sinus impingement. Calcified aorta with no other findings. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: regular wide QRS tachycardia at 153 bpm with morphology of right bundle branch block (RBBB), superior axis; no fusion beats, AV dissociation or concordance in precordials. Transthoracic echocardiogram on admission: non-dilated left ventricle with moderate concentric hypertrophy and preserved global systolic function without segmental disorders. Moderately dilated left atrium. Right ventricle of normal size and preserved contractility. Mitroaortic sclerosis without repercussion (mild mitral insufficiency). Filling pattern: impaired relaxation. Minimal posterior pericardial effusion without repercussion. Normal aorta. Electrophysiological study (EPS): poor and decremental ventriculoatrial conduction. Anterograde Wenkebach point 360 ms, no overt pre-excitation with atrial stimulation; with adenosine administration there is evidence of pre-excitation at low frequencies but also simultaneous block of the pathway and atrioventricular node (AVN) (blocked P waves). Induction of atrial tachycardia is not achieved even after isoprenaline infusion. Coronary sinus mapping was performed and during bouts of pre-excitation an area of greater ventricular precocity was observed at the posterior-postero-lateral level and a pre-excitation pattern consistent (12/12) with clinical tachycardia. Transseptal puncture was performed and the mitral annulus was mapped to identify the area of maximum ventricular pre-excitation in the posterior area, requiring several applications to achieve ablation of the pathway, which was finally checked with adenosine. After adenosine, the patient presented atrial fibrillation, and electrical cardioversion was successfully performed.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the cardiac intermediate care unit for monitoring. On arrival, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed concentric hypertrophy with normal global systolic function without segmental disorders. The wide QRS tachycardia tracings were initially interpreted as ventricular tachycardia originating in the posterior papillary muscle (QRS with BCRDHH morphology and superior axis), so we started treatment with oral verapamil (120 mg every 12 hours), despite which he continued to present episodes of tachycardia with wide QRS on the monitor, self-limited. Daily 12-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm at 75 bpm, with evidence of ventricular enlargement, early transition and left anterior hemiblock (HBAIHH), with a pseudo-delta wave in inferior leads and V3-V5, which was interpreted as alterations typical of ventricular hypertrophy. Two days later, an ECG was performed in sinus rhythm at 82 bpm where a clear delta wave was observed; in addition, telemetry showed more obvious pre-excitation in supraventricular extrasystoles. Although the wide QRS tachycardia was initially interpreted as SMVT, and the delta wave as a pseudo-delta wave in the context of ventricular hypertrophy, what led us to suspect a possible pre-excitation was the ECG immediately after the infusion of procainamide, in which a narrow basal QRS without a delta wave was observed, and how in the following days, without the effect of procainamide, an inconspicuous delta wave was observed in the ECGs in sinus rhythm, which became more pronounced with verapamil treatment. Given the suspicion of a left lateral accessory pathway, we performed a test with 12 mg of i.v. adenosine, which revealed pre-excitation. The case was discussed with arrhythmology and an electrophysiological study was performed, where an accessory pathway was found in the posterior portion of the mitral annulus, which was successfully ablated, and the pre-excitation disappeared in the control ECGs.

Biomarkers of myocardial damage: troponin I (hsTnI) 6,514 ng/l --> 3,343 ng/l --> 3,810 ng/l --> 3,046 --> 2,343 ng/l (normal range: 0.0-11.6 ng/l). RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2: negative. Chest X-ray: centred cardiomediastinal silhouette. Cardiothoracic index (CTI) less than 0.5. Lung fields translucent, without pleural effusion or condensation. Transthoracic echocardiogram: Portable echocardiogram on admission to the coronary unit: non-dilated left ventricle, with extensive septal akinesia, without other alterations of segmental contractility, with preserved global systolic function. Non-dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function. Normal filling pressures. Absence of significant valvular heart disease. Aortic root and left atrium of normal diameters. Absence of pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram prior to discharge: similar to previous study. Global systolic function preserved. Haemodynamics: Emergent coronary angiography on arrival. Trunk: normal. Anterior descending artery: image compatible with spontaneous coronary dissection at mid-distal level. Distal flow TIMI 3. Circumflex artery: image compatible with spontaneous coronary artery dissection at first obtuse marginal level. Distal flow TIMI 3. Right coronary artery: dominant, normal. Control coronary angiography on the third day of admission. Truncus: normal. Anterior descending artery: image compatible with spontaneous coronary artery dissection at mid level with progression to more distal level compared to previous catheterisation and increased haematoma causing distal flow TIMI 1. Circumflex artery: image compatible with spontaneous coronary artery dissection at first obtuse marginal level. Distal flow TIMI 3. Right coronary artery: dominant, normal. Angio-CT: cardiac cavities of normal size. Ascending and descending thoracic aorta of normal calibre, slightly elongated. Abdominal aorta of high normal calibre (28-29 mm) without arteriosclerosis. At the origin of the celiac trunk there is an image compatible with a haematoma with dense contrast in its interior that could correspond to intramural bleeding causing severe stenosis at that level. Hepatic, splenic and mesenteric arteries without alterations. Normal renal arteries. Absence of coronary calcium. Coronary angiography: left coronary trunk of normal calibre and origin without arteriosclerosis. Anterior descending artery of normal calibre and origin without arteriosclerosis. Haematoma is visualised in the distal anterior descending (AD) artery causing significant stenosis. Circumflex artery of normal calibre and origin without arteriosclerosis. Marginal obtuse branch of good calibre, without arteriosclerosis or signs of vascular involvement. Right coronary artery of normal calibre and origin, without arteriosclerosis, the distal segments are not adequately visualised due to movement artefacts. Absence of signs of vascular involvement. In summary: an image compatible with focal haematoma (small longitudinal extension) with signs of intramural bleeding (contrast density in the central area) located at the origin of the celiac trunk and in the distal portion of the anterior descending artery causing a significant decrease in the calibre of both vessels. No other notable vascular alterations were observed.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the emergency department, an electrocardiogram was performed showing ST-segment elevation in anterior leads, activating the haemodynamic alert. Diagnostic coronary angiography showed spontaneous coronary dissection in the middle anterior descending artery (mAD) and the first obtuse marginal branch (1st OM) with preserved distal flow in both arteries, and conservative treatment was decided with double antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation and admission to the coronary unit for follow-up. The patient remained asymptomatic for the first 2 days with a progressive decrease in biomarkers of myocardial damage and electrocardiographic evolution characterised by the appearance of deep negative T waves in the anterolateral and inferior face. On the third day of admission to the coronary unit, he presented several episodes of angina-like central thoracic pain at rest with ST-segment elevation in anterior leads. It was decided to repeat the coronary angiography showing progression of the LAD dissection at distal level with compromise of distal flow (TIMI 1). In view of the findings described, it was decided to maintain conservative and symptomatic management. Subsequent good evolution without new episodes of chest pain, with progressive decrease in biomarkers of myocardial damage and electrocardiographic evolution of acute myocardial infarction, so it was decided to discharge the patient with double antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg, ramipril 2.5 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg and nebivolol 2.5 mg. The patient attended a scheduled outpatient check-up with the cardiologist in the area 2 weeks later, reporting episodes of typical angina with moderate exertion, so it was decided to request an angio-CT scan to assess the resolution of the haematoma and rule out fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). The CT scan showed an image compatible with focal haematoma with signs of intramural bleeding located at the origin of the celiac trunk and in the distal portion of the anterior descending artery, causing a significant reduction in the calibre of both vessels. The decision was made to maintain conservative management of both lesions by increasing the dose of oral beta-blockers, withdrawing clopidogrel and adding nitrates to relieve symptoms, with good initial clinical response, no recurrence of episodes of chest pain and no associated abdominal symptoms.  DIAGNOSIS Anterior STEMI. Killip I. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the mid-distal anterior descending artery and first obtuse marginal artery. Preserved LV systolic function. Focal haematoma with signs of intramural bleeding located at the origin of the celiac trunk. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Family history of ischaemic heart disease in his father at 47 years of age, and in two maternal uncles at 42 and 50 years of age respectively. No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: no hypertension, no diabetes, no dyslipidaemia. Obesity (body mass index [BMI] 35). No toxic habits.  Cardiological history: assessed in 2012 for progressive exertional angina, antianginal and anti-ischaemic treatment was started and an echocardiogram was performed with globally and segmentally preserved systolic function; given clinical persistence despite medical treatment, coronary catheterisation was performed with no significant angiographic lesions. Cardiological treatment was withdrawn, anxiolytics and the usual analgesics were started, and the patient was discharged from cardiology consultations. Referred again in 2014 for progressive exertional angina, with sporadic episodes at rest, which persisted despite antidepressant treatment combined with the usual analgesics, it was decided to request another coronary catheterisation, again showing no significant angiographic lesions. She was again discharged from cardiology and referred to psychiatry by her primary care physician. Referred again in 2019 due to functional worsening, with persistent episodes of chest pain on exertion and isolated episodes of greater intensity at rest. In this case, a diagnosis of "syndrome X" was made and only ranolazine 375 mg/12 hours was added to her treatment (without antiplatelet agents or statins) and myocardial perfusion SPECT, a new transthoracic echocardiogram and a review in one year with the results were requested.  No other history of interest. Baseline situation: sedentary lifestyle. Life limited by episodes of chest pain with significant impairment and secondary emotional lability. Usual treatment: ranolazine 375 mg/ 12 hours, sertraline 50 mg at breakfast, lorazepam 2 mg 1 tablet at breakfast and another at dinner, paracetamol 650 mg/tramadol 75 mg every 8 hours and ibuprofen 400 mg on demand.  Current illness Consultation at the emergency department for an episode of oppressive central thoracic pain, with significant accompanying neurovegetative symptoms, onset at rest, self-limiting, lasting about 20 minutes and with significant emotional involvement. He says that it reminds him of previous episodes of chest pain and that he has already had several coronary angiographies and that "he has never had to have stents fitted", but that he has recently undergone a test to study his heart, which he cannot specify and that he is awaiting a review in the outpatient cardiology department with the results next week. After reviewing the patient's history and medical records, it is found that a few weeks ago a myocardial perfusion SPECT was performed showing inducible myocardial ischaemia in the anterior aspect. Serial electrocardiograms performed in the emergency department, carried out when the patient was no longer in pain, showed no changes or dynamic alterations suggestive of ischaemia. The study was completed by enzyme seriation, which was found to be normal. Chest X-ray with no findings. However, despite the normality of the complementary tests performed in the emergency department, they decided to contact the on-call cardiology team for assessment.  Physical examination On arrival, the patient was haemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 130/60 mmHg, a heart rate of 64 beats per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98% at baseline. She was oriented and cooperative, with marked emotional lability and crying. Physical examination was unremarkable. Echocardioscopy showed preserved systolic function globally and segmentally, without significant valvular heart disease or pericardial effusion. At the insistence of the patient and her history, it was decided to admit her to hospital for readjustment of medical treatment and to assess the possibility of performing a new coronary catheterisation with invasive functional study to rule out coronary vasospasm and/or microvascular dysfunction as the aetiology of the chest pain.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: glucose 83 mg/dl, glycosylated haemoglobin (A1c) 5.3%, creatinine (serum) 0.86 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate calculated by CKD-EPI formula 76 ml/min/1.73 m2, urea 38 mg/dl 21 - 43, uric acid 4.1 mg/dl, total proteins 7.7 g/dl, total cholesterol 147 mg/dl, hDL cholesterol 45 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol (calculated) 125 mg/dl, triglycerides 98 mg/dl, total bilirubin 0.72 mg/dl, aspartate transaminase (GOT) 19 U/l, alanine transaminase (GPT) 22, haemoglobin 12.7 g/dl, leucocytes 9745 x 103μl, platelets 289 x 103μl. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 67 beats per minute, PR 180 ms, normal axis, narrow QRS, QTc 410 ms, no acute repolarisation abnormalities. Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index within the normal range. Free costophrenic sinuses, no evidence of vascular redistribution. No masses or consolidations.  Echocardioscopy: preserved systolic function without segmentarity. Absence of significant valvulopathies. No pericardial effusion. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) of normal size, thickness and systolic and diastolic function. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size and function. Left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) of normal size. No valvular heart disease. No indirect signs of pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Aortic root of normal size. No pericardial effusion. Myocardial perfusion SPECT: Mild precordial pressure without ECG alteration during regadenoson administration Baseline HR 90 bpm post-stress 120 bpm. Post-stress study shows anteroseptal myocardial hypocaptation which normalises at rest. Findings suggestive of myocardial ischaemia induced in the territory of the anterior descending coronary artery (AD). Coronary catheterisation with invasive functional study: coronary tree of normal distribution and development. Right dominance. Absence of angiographically significant lesions. A study of microvascular dysfunction was performed by thermodilution with saline boluses and an IMR of 78 and a CFR of 0.8 were obtained, indicating severe microvascular dysfunction. Positive vasoreactivity test with acetylcholine in the territory of the anterior descending artery at a dose of 100 μm (reduction of coronary diameter > 90%, ischaemic changes in the electrocardiogram and clinical signs of angina). Conclusion: severe microvascular dysfunction and coronary spasm in the territory of the anterior descending coronary artery.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Once admitted to the cardiology ward, anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal treatment was reinforced, and a transthoracic echocardiogram and a new coronary catheterisation with invasive functional study were requested. The echocardiographic study showed preserved global and segmental systolic function, without systolic dysfunction or valvular heart disease. However, the coronary catheterisation performed showed no significant angiographic lesions, with no changes with respect to previous studies. It was decided to perform a complete functional study in the haemodynamics room using thermodilution with saline boluses and intravenous adenosine perfusion to obtain the microvascular resistance index (MRI) and coronary flow reserve (CFR). The results obtained were markers of severe microvascular dysfunction: MRI 78 (cut-off point <25) and CFR of 0.8 (cut-off point >2-2.5). The study was completed with the coronary vasoreactivity test to rule out coronary vasospasm, which was positive in the territory of the anterior descending coronary artery with an intracoronary dose of 100 μg (reduction in coronary diameter greater than 90%, dynamic alterations in the ECG and clinical symptoms of angina). Given these results, the patient was diagnosed with severe microvascular dysfunction and coronary vasospasm, and it was decided to progressively withdraw anxiolytic and antidepressant treatment, and acetylsalicylic acid, atorvastatin, amlodipine and nitroglycerin night patches were added, showing clear symptomatic improvement, as well as a marked decrease in emotional lability on finally learning the aetiology of the chest pain. At the review 12 months after admission to the cardiology outpatient clinic, the patient is asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view, and has managed to discontinue all antidepressant and anxiolytic medication and has progressively begun to engage in physical activity with excellent tolerance.   DIAGNOSIS Angina with documented ischaemia in AD territory with coronary arteries without significant lesions (INOCA). Severe microvascular dysfunction confirmed by invasive functional study. Coronary vasospasm in the territory of the anterior descending artery induced during acetylcholine test. Preserved global and segmental systolic function. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 58-year-old male. No known drug allergies. Active smoker of 1 pack a day. No other cardiovascular risk factors. Recent diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma with lymph node involvement, undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with docetaxel, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (FLOT scheme). He started the first cycle 24 hours before admission to the cardiology department. Usual medication: metamizole 575 mg/8h, metoclopramide 10 mg/8h, paracetamol 1 g/8h, tramadol 50 mg/8h, dexamethasone 8 mg/24h, omeprazole 20 mg/24h.  Present illness Started chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil in continuous infusion through a reservoir 24 hours ago. He came to the emergency department for an episode of oppressive chest pain, radiating to both extremities and associated with vegetative cortex, with abrupt onset and spontaneous disappearance after 30 minutes, and was subsequently asymptomatic. On arrival at the emergency department, electrocardiogram (ECG) showed isoelectric ST and the patient was haemodynamically stable. After 2 hours in the ED, he presented a second episode of typically angina-like central thoracic pain with electrical evidence of ST elevation of up to 4 mm on the inferolateral side associated with hypertensive reaction (blood pressure [BP] 198/101 mmHg). After administration of sublingual nitroglycerin, there was clinical improvement and retrogradation of electrical changes with flattening of repolarisation in V5-V6. No dyspnoea or other associated symptoms. During his stay in the emergency department he presented a new recurrence of pain with ST elevation in II-III-aVF, V1-V4. Cardiology was contacted and the AMI code was activated.   Initially the perfusion of 5-fluorouracil was stopped and i.v. nitroglycerin was started. On arrival in haemodynamics the patient was asymptomatic and the ECG changes had regressed. Emergent coronary angiography was performed with ectatic coronary arteries, without significant angiographic lesions. Aortography ruled out signs of dissection at the level of the ascending aorta, aortic arch and thoracic descending aorta.  Physical examination Weight 85 kg, height 1.85m. Good general condition, normohydrated, normoperfused. Conscious and oriented. No signs of heart failure. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones, no murmurs. Peripheral pulses present and symmetrical. Respiratory auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: normal examination, no pathological findings.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiograms: ECG with pain: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS axis at +30o, ST elevation II, III, aVF, V3, V4, V5, V6 (maximum 4 mm in II). ECG without pain and on discharge: sinus rhythm at 74 bpm, normalisation of the previously described changes with isoelectric ST, without other repolarisation alterations. AP portable chest X-ray on arrival at the ED: no condensation in the lung parenchyma or signs of pulmonary congestion. Laboratory tests: Initial blood tests (in the ED): glucose 160 mg/dl; urea 51 mmol/l; creatinine 1 mg/dl; GFR 82 ml/min; sodium 139 mEq/l; potassium 3.85 mEq/l; leukocytes 10.82 x109/l; haemoglobin 15.6 g/dl; haematocrit 44.1%; platelets 210 x109/l; INR 1.14. Myocardial enzymes: peak TnI-US 29.70 pg/ml (normal 2-25 pg/ml) and peak CK 295 U/l (normal 10-195 U/l). SARS-CoV-2 PCR: negative. Complete laboratory tests 24 hours after admission: Metabolic profile: total cholesterol 186 mg/dl; LDL 123 mg/dl; HDL 40 mg/dl; triglycerides 115 mg/dl; HbA1c 5.1%. Liver function: GOT 23 U/l, GPT 14 U/l, GGT 20 U/l, total bilirubin 0.71. Haemogram without alterations. Coronary angiography: right dominance. Ectatic coronary arteries, without significant angiographic lesions. Aortography: absence of complications of ascending aorta and aortic arch. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) neither dilated nor hypertrophied with normal systolic function without regional contractile asymmetries. Right ventricle not dilated and normocontractile. Normal atria. Absence of functionally significant valvular heart disease. Normal pulmonary pressure. No pericardial effusion. No mechanical complications.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION Medical treatment was maintained with intravenous nitrates, with subsequent enteral conversion after satisfactory blood pressure control, remaining haemodynamically stable and without angina recurrence. After 48 hours of monitoring, we contacted our medical oncology colleagues to adjust and control the medication for her oncological process. During the subsequent evolution, given that he did not require treatment with 5-FU, it was decided to perform a subtotal R2 gastrectomy and start treatment with irinotecan. On discharge, from the cardiological point of view, treatment was maintained with: acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg 0-1-0, nifedipine 20 mg 1-1-1, isosorbide mononitrate 40 mg 0-1-1 and fluvastatin 40 mg 0-0-1-1.  DIAGNOSIS Coronary vasospasm secondary to 5-fluoruracil treatment. Non-Q acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Killip I. Preserved LV systolic function. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History  64-year-old female patient, with the following history: No family history of interest for the current picture. No known adverse drug reactions. Cardiovascular risk factors: long-standing arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia and long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus, without target organ damage. Denies toxic habits. Previous surgeries: breast reduction, tubal ligation. Previous admissions: admission in 2019 to internal medicine for atypical chest pain, discharged after ergometry, which was inconclusive, and myocardial perfusion SPECT, which was negative. Usual treatment: enalapril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg 1 tablet every 24 hours, sitagliptin 100 mg 1 tablet every 24 hours.  Present illness She was referred to the emergency department for chest pain of several days' duration. The patient describes the pain as central-thoracic, oppressive, intermittent, non-radiating, not accompanied by vegetative cortex, which appears with exertion and improves with rest, of 5 days' evolution. Today's episode was more intense, so she went to her primary care physician, who referred her to the hospital due to pathological findings on the electrocardiogram (ECG), suggestive of acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation. The main finding of interest in the ED analysis was the presence of mobilisation of markers of myocardial damage in the range of myocardial necrosis: TnT-hs 25 - 47 - 93 ng/l. A diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome was therefore made, and coronary angiography was requested, which was performed the following day and showed a lesion in the middle circumflex artery, which was revascularised by implanting a drug-eluting stent. During her stay on the hospital ward, she progressed well, with no new episodes of chest pain. Echocardiography was performed, which showed preserved biventricular function, without segmental contractility disorders. In-hospital laboratory tests showed preserved renal function, an improved lipid profile and high levels of glycosylated haemoglobin. Finally, she was discharged with the following treatment at discharge: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg (1 tablet every 24 h), ticagrelor 90 mg (1 tablet every 12 h), enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg (1 tablet every 24 h), bisoprolol 5 mg (1 tablet every 24 h), atorvastatin 80 mg (1 tablet in the evening), omeprazole 20 mg (1 tablet before breakfast), canaglifozin 100 mg (1 tablet every 24 h), sitagliptin/metformin 50 mg/1g (1 tablet every 12 h).   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG in the emergency department. Coronary angiography: right dominance. Right coronary artery without significant lesions suggestive of revascularisation. Left coronary tree with significant lesion in the middle circumflex artery, revascularised by implanting 1 drug-eluting stent. Echocardiography: non-dilated left ventricle with slight concentric hypertrophy of the walls. No segmental contractility disorders were observed. Right ventricle not dilated. Biventricular function preserved (LVEF 58%). Atria not dilated. Absence of significant valvular heart disease. No pericardial effusion. Regular laboratory tests: renal function preserved, with baseline creatinine of 0.48 mg/dl and estimated filtration rate of 104 ml/min/1.73 m2. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 174 mg/dl, with LDL cholesterol 98 mg/dl and HDL 46 mg/dl and triglycerides 150 mg/dl. Glycosylated haemoglobin: 7.3%.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was referred on discharge to cardiac rehabilitation, where she started a structured exercise programme, in addition to a comprehensive approach to cardiovascular risk factors. She was a diabetic patient with poor control, with an HbA1c of 7.3%, who was on home treatment with sitagliptin and who, on discharge, was upgraded to sitagliptin/metformin and it was decided to add canaglifozin for cardiovascular benefit.  During follow-up, the patient presented gastrointestinal discomfort, which subsided after stopping metformin, so she started to discontinue oral hypoglycaemic treatment and began to have poor daily glycaemic control. Not only that, but practically simultaneously, the patient had several episodes of genitourinary tract infections, all of fungal origin (C. albicans), associated with treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (iSGLT2) inhibitors, which responded to antifungal treatment, but relapsed a few days later. In this situation, it was decided to take general measures to try to prevent new episodes of genitourinary infections, but all these measures were ineffective, so her primary care physician decided to discontinue treatment with iSGLT2 and to start treatment directly with slow-acting insulin. When she was reviewed again in cardiac rehabilitation consultations, it was decided to try a different course of action, which was to start treatment with a glucagon-like peptide type 1 receptor agonist (arGLP1). Therefore, treatment was started with semaglutide 0.25 mg (1 injection per week), which was well tolerated. After 4 weeks, the dose is increased to 0.5 mg (1 injection per week). Again it is well tolerated and with good glycaemic control. Finally, after another 4 weeks, a maximum dose of 1 g per week is reached, with good clinical tolerance and good glycaemic control, even leading to withdrawal of insulin. After 3 months of treatment, the regular blood test showed an HbA1c of 6.4%, reaching the desired target, having lost 3 kg of weight throughout the process. All this led to the decision to maintain this monotherapy treatment indefinitely.  DIAGNOSIS Ischaemic heart disease. Acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation, with single-vessel involvement of the circumflex artery, revascularised by implanting 1 stent. Preserved biventricular function. Very high cardiovascular risk: hypertension, dyslipidaemia and long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor metabolic control. Intolerance to metformin. Repeated urinary tract infections with iSGLT2. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Present illness A 58-year-old male patient with the previously described family and personal history and under follow-up in outpatient cardiology consultations for progressive angina of 2 months' evolution and segmental alterations in transthoracic echocardiography, who was admitted to the ward for scheduled coronary angiography.  Physical examination Good general condition, well hydrated and perfused. Eupneic at rest, tolerates decubitus. Blood pressure: 147/92 mmHg. Heart rate: 65 bpm. Central obesity. Height 165 cm. Weight 97,5 kg. Body mass index (BMI) 35,81. Cardiorespiratory auscultation with rhythmic tones, no murmurs. Conservative vesicular murmur with no added noises. Absence of oedema in the lower limbs with pulses present.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm, normal axis. Normal PR. QRS with right bundle branch block image, Q wave in DII, DIII and avF. Laboratory tests on admission: glomerular filtration rate 78 ml/min, glucose 148 mg/dl, Hb1Ac 8.3%. Lipid profile with total cholesterol 307 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 215 mg/dl, triglycerides 513 mg/dl. GOT 20 IU/l, GPT 33 IU/l. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left atrium not dilated. Non-dilated left ventricle with moderate concentric hypertrophy. Inferobasal hypokinesia with remaining preserved segmental contractility. LVEF 61%. Mitral filling flow with impaired relaxation pattern. Trivalve aortic valve without significant valvulopathy. Aortic root and ascending aorta not dilated. Normal appearing mitral valve without significant valvulopathy. Right chambers not dilated, right ventricular function preserved. No tricuspid insufficiency (TI) to estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. No pericardial effusion. Cardiac catheterisation: severe stenosis of 65% of the distal left main coronary artery (LMCA), 70% stenosis of the proximal anterior descending (LAD), 90% stenosis in the middle segment of the circumflex (Cx), 100% occlusion of the proximal segment. Post admission blood tests: normal haemogram. Renal function with glomerular filtration rate 90 ml/min, normal ions, urea 29 mg/dl. Lipid profile with total cholesterol 115 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 52 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 33 mg/dl, triglycerides 150 mg/dl, lipoprotein (a) 4.5 mg/dl. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.4%. GPT 18 IU/l, GGT 38 IU/l.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Scheduled coronary angiography was performed, documenting significant LMCA disease and three-vessel disease. Given the multivessel coronary involvement, the patient's age and DM2, the option of surgical treatment was recommended. Cardiac surgery was consulted and accepted the case and the patient was scheduled for revascularisation surgery during admission. Myocardial revascularisation surgery was performed with quadruple aortocoronary bypass (proximal internal mammary artery - proximal LAD, posterior descending saphenous, marginal saphenous-obtuse, saphenous-1odiagonal) without incident and with good evolution during the postoperative period. During admission and on discharge after the operation, the analytical parameters were analysed, highlighting poor metabolic control with HbA1c figures of 8.3% and a lipid profile outside target figures according to her cardiovascular risk level. Therefore, in accordance with current recommendations on the management of patients at high cardiovascular risk, it was decided to optimise treatment with high-potency statins (rosuvastatin 20 mg) plus ezetimibe 10 mg and to add arGLP1 to the oral antidiabetic treatment as a weekly injectable semaglutide, given its proven cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. The initial dose of semaglutide 0.25 mg subcutaneous weekly is started and will be titrated in consultations according to tolerance.  On discharge, the patient is reminded of the importance of smoking cessation and lifestyle changes. The patient was reviewed in consultations 4 months after admission, the clinical evolution was favourable, with no new episodes of chest pain and progressive recovery of his normal life after the operation. The patient reports that he has lost nearly 10 kg but continues to smoke. The control laboratory tests show LDL-cholesterol figures of 33 mg/dl and HbA1c levels of 6.4%, as well as an improvement in the liver profile and normalisation of uric acid parameters. His primary care physician has titrated subcutaneous doses of semaglutide, and he is currently on a maintenance dose (1 mg sc per week), and the patient does not report any intolerance to the drug and only highlights the increased feeling of satiety that has helped him to lose weight. It was decided to refer the patient to the smoking cessation centre at his health centre. At subsequent check-ups, the patient remained asymptomatic, had stopped smoking after starting treatment with varenicline (Champix©), continued analytical control with target figures in secondary prevention and no new hospital admissions.   DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Progressive angina with multivessel coronary disease. Surgical revascularisation by quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting. Poorly controlled familial combined dyslipidaemia. Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 29-year-old woman.  History Family history: father died of sudden death with suspected ischaemic heart disease at the age of 58 years, in April 2020 (no autopsy due to COVID-19 pandemic situation). No known drug allergies. Personal history: asthmatic bronchitis, thalassaemia minor. No contact at risk for COVID-19 infection. No past infection. Not vaccinated. Toxic habits: active smoking (10 packs/year), daily use of cannabis. Previous medication: levonorgestrel/ethinylestradiol as oral contraceptive, inhaled formoterol/budesonide on demand, folic acid.  Current illness She came to the emergency department for chest pain. The previous day she had presented with oppressive central chest pain at rest one hour after eating, increasing with deep inspiration, non-radiating, without vegetative cortex. The patient had consulted her health centre, where she underwent an electrocardiogram that showed no abnormalities. During the night she presented vomiting and diarrhoeic stools, as well as persistent pain, which finally subsided with a 600 mg ibuprofen tablet, allowing her to rest. The day she went to the emergency department, she started again with more intense, stabbing, non-radiating pain, which improved when seated and worsened in the supine decubitus and with inspiration, without vegetative cortex, with a fever of 37.5 oC, with no other symptoms. The patient denied temperature control in previous days. On our assessment in the emergency department, intravenous acetylsalicylic acid was administered, with partial relief of pain, which persisted only on deep inspiration. The patient reported having presented some months earlier with non-specific precordial discomfort, always self-limited and without other symptoms, which she related to anxiety. There were no previous episodes suggestive of angina and no recent worsening of functional class. Laboratory tests showed an elevation of ultrasensitive troponin, in a downward curve. An electrocardiogram was performed, showing diffuse ST segment elevation in the inferior and anterior face, as well as urgent echocardioscopy at the bedside, which showed a left ventricle that was neither dilated nor hypertrophic, with apical septal akinesia and of the apical segment of the right ventricle, with no other notable pathological findings.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 142 /82 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 120 bpm, oxygen saturation 99% (with room air). Acceptable general condition, normohydrated, normoperfused, eupneic at rest. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: vesicular murmur preserved in all fields, no extra sounds. Lower limbs: no oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis, good distal perfusion, symmetrical pulses.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC on admission: haemoglobin 12.9 g/dl, leukocytes 18,040 /μl with 14,670 neutrophils/μl, 1,880 lymphocytes/μl, platelets 412.000 /μl, D-dimer 310 mg/ml, creatinine 0.67 mg/dl with estimated glomerular filtration rate > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, ions in normal range, GOT 202, GPT 36, LDH 555, GGT 20 IU/l, total bilirubin 0.82 mg/dl. CPK 1,079 IU/l, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dl, LDL 135 mg/dl, CRP 18.7 mg/l, troponin I (hs-TnI) 19,141 -> 15,540 ng/l (normal < 53.5 ng/l), NTproBNP 1,982 pg/ml. CBC 3rd day of admission: haemogram normal, renal function and ions normal; CRP rising 196 mg/l. Procalcitonin normal. Electrocardiogram on admission: sinus rhythm at 67 bpm, PR < 200 ms, narrow QRS, normal axis. Amputated R wave in V4-V5. Diffuse ST elevation in V2-V5 and inferior aspect. Electrocardiogram after 24 hours: sinus rhythm at 75 bpm, PR < 200 ms, narrow QRS, normal axis, ST-segment elevation in V2-5 and inferior aspect with negative T-wave in the same leads. Chest X-ray on admission: cardiothoracic index within normal limits, free costophrenic sinuses, no evidence of vascular redistribution, no parenchymal opacities. SARS-CoV-2 PCR on admission and at 8 days: undetectable. SARS-CoV-2 serology: IgG negative; IgM positive. Transthoracic echocardiogram 2nd day of admission: non-dilated, non-hypertrophic left ventricle, with preserved global systolic function. Akinesia of the apex and apical segments of the inferior septum and inferior face, and of the apical and middle segment of the anterior septum. Apical intracavitary thrombus with a fresh appearance. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Akinesia of the most apical segment of the right ventricular free wall. Atria of normal size. Mild tricuspid insufficiency without other valvulopathies. Minimal amount of pericardial fluid. CT of coronary arteries 2nd day of admission: (video 2) calcium score: Agatston 0. Coronary arteries with normal anatomical origin. Right dominance. Left coronary artery trunk: vessel of good development, without lesions. Anterior descending (AD): well-developed vessel. In the middle segment, between the exit of the 2nd diagonal and the septal, there is a lesion of about 5 mm in length that stenoses the lumen by 50%, which is compatible with soft plaque as a first possibility. Diagonals: 2 of moderate development, without lesions and one septal of good development. Circumflex (CX): well-developed vessel, without lesions. Marginal obtuse: 4 vessels, the first of which is very poorly developed, the rest are well developed, without lesions. Right coronary artery (RC): dominant vessel of good development, without lesions. Posterior descending pulmonary artery (PVI): poorly developed, no lesions. Chest visualisation: thrombus in the cardiac apex. No pericardial effusion. Catheterisation on the 2nd day of admission: (videos 3 and 4) right radial access. Trunk: no lesions. LAD: normodeveloped, with eccentric focal stenosis in the middle segment, with contrast defect highly suggestive of parietal thrombus. The distal LAD presents abundant contrastation defects that suggest thrombus embolisation as a first possibility. CX: no significant lesions. CD: dominant, with contrastation defect in proximal segment compatible with intracoronary thrombus. Good distal vessel. Catheterisation on the 12th day of admission: angiographic review and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Left coronary artery (LMCA) without lesions. The anterior descending artery of good calibre and development with angiographically mild atheromatosis in the middle segment, distal to the exit of the main diagonal branch. The distal vessel showed TIMI 3 flow, with no angiographic evidence of thrombus. OCT was performed, visualising a completely healthy distal vessel with the presence of a lipid plaque in the middle LAD, with a thin layer fibroatheroma and very focal intimal rupture, immediately distal to the diagonal, with a minimal non-pathological luminal area (MLA 7.5 mm2) and absence of thrombus. Circumflex of good calibre and development without significant lesions. Dominant right coronary artery of good calibre and development without significant lesions. The thrombus is not visualised in the proximal segment and the vessel has distal TIMI 3 flow. OCT was not performed in CD due to ostial spasm with the catheter. Conclusion: apical infarction secondary to thrombotic lesion in the middle LAD with embolisation of thrombus to the distal vessel (which is healthy on OCT). Probable coronary embolism from thrombus in LV apex to DC, resolved after antithrombotic treatment. Transthoracic echocardiogram at discharge: non-dilated, non-hypertrophic left ventricle, with preserved global systolic function. Akinesia of the apical segments and strict apex with mobile intracavitary thrombus of smaller size and echogenicity than in the previous echocardiogram (1.5 x 1.2 cm). Right ventricle of normal size and function. Atria of normal size. Minimal tricuspid insufficiency without other valvulopathies. No indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Minimal amount of pericardial fluid as previously described.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the coronary unit in respiratory and contact isolation due to the positive result of the Sars-Cov-2 PCR, with the initial diagnostic suspicion of viral myopericarditis for observation and completion of the study. A regular echocardiogram was performed with an image of intracavitary thrombus that was not present the previous day, so anticoagulant treatment was started with i.v. unfractionated heparin. Given the echocardiogram findings and taking into account the patient's low cardiovascular risk, a CT scan of the coronary arteries was performed showing at least a moderate lesion in the LAD artery. Coronary angiography showed intracoronary thrombosis without underlying atherosclerotic lesions in the middle and distal LAD and proximal RCA, with preserved flow. Given the suspicion of an underlying prothrombotic state (patient smoker, in treatment with oral contraceptives and active SARS-CoV2 infection) and given that the patient was asymptomatic at that time and haemodynamically stable, initial pharmacological management was decided with infusion of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, followed by treatment with anticoagulation and double antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. During her stay in the coronary unit, the patient presented chest discomfort with an inflammatory profile, with an increase in acute phase reactants (CRP rising to 149 mg/l), without pericardial effusion. Bacterial superinfection was ruled out and treatment with colchicine was started, with good clinical evolution and improvement in the analytical parameters of inflammation in the following days. He was transferred to the cardiology ward where he remained clinically stable. A new control coronary angiography was performed ten days after the first one, where the previous thrombi in the LAD and DC were not visualised. OCT showed a lipid plaque in the middle LAD, with thin layer fibroatheroma and very focal intimal rupture. Given the angiographic evolution, the patient's clinical profile and the findings on intracoronary imaging techniques, conservative management of the lesion in the middle LAD was decided. A control echocardiogram prior to discharge showed persistent thrombus in the apex, although smaller than in previous studies. During the following days, treatment was maintained with acenocoumarol and clopidogrel. The patient was discharged with the following treatment: clopidogrel, acenocoumarol, pantoprazole, bisoprolol, atorvastatin and colchicine. She was assessed by haematology and a thrombophilia study was decided once the acute phase had passed, on an outpatient basis. Smoking cessation was recommended and hormonal contraception was discontinued. The patient progressed favourably, the SARS-CoV2 infection resolved, and she was discharged to continue outpatient follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Acute pericarditis due to SARS-CoV-2. Acute coronary syndrome of the anterior STEMI type: thrombosis in the middle anterior descending artery due to atheroma plaque instability with distal embolisation. Embolic infarction in proximal right coronary artery with preserved distal flow, without angiographically significant atheromatous stenosis. Apical akinesia with apical thrombus. Preserved global left ventricular systolic function. Suspected thrombophilia, pending completion of the study. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Cardiovascular risk factors: arterial hypertension (without medical treatment) and grade II obesity (weight 90 kg, height 1.6 m, body mass index [BMI] 35.15 kg/m2). Other history: low back pain due to L4-L5 and L5-S1 facet overload and L4-L5 disc degeneration, cervical pain due to cervical spondylosis with slight posterior protrusion C3-C4, C5-C6 and C6-C7 without spinal cord involvement. Anxiety syndrome, claustrophobia. Peripheral vertigo. Surgical: right carpal tunnel syndrome, caesarean section, curettage for abortion. Toxic: denied. Family history: paternal grandfather died of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at the age of 64. Usual medication: diazepam 5 mg orally (if required), dexketoprofen 25 mg orally (if required).  Present illness A 44-year-old woman presented with a clinical picture of 48 hours' evolution, characterised by a first episode of oppressive, retrosternal chest pain of moderate intensity, while at rest, self-limited for 30 minutes, not radiating, not accompanied by vegetative cortex and without modification with postural changes, which she relieved spontaneously. In the following 24 hours, he presented two new episodes of similar characteristics (one in the early morning, self-limited, and the other in the afternoon) for which he consulted a private centre. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an inframillimetric suprathreshold level in DI-AVL and a tendency to ST-segment sublevel in DIII and AVF. Anti-inflammatory treatment was administered with clinical improvement, and she was referred to the emergency department of the referral hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient remained asymptomatic, but during her stay she presented a febrile peak, without associated infectious focus, with the same electrocardiographic findings and echocardiogram with preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function, without segmental alterations of contractility, without significant valvular heart disease and without pericardial effusion. In view of the patient's clinical condition, it was decided to admit her to the coronary care unit, with suspicion of acute myocarditis versus acute coronary syndrome, for continuous cardiovascular monitoring and extension studies, such as cardiac catheterisation. Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 155/87 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 75 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) 14 rpm, temperature 36.3 oC, basal oxygen saturation 97%. General condition stable, hydrated, eupneic. Neck: jugular ingurgitation could not be assessed due to obesity. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, muffled tones without murmurs or friction rubs. Pulmonary auscultation: clear audible vesicular murmur, no extra sounds. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of venous thrombosis. Neurological: vigil, conscious, oriented, without focality.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiograms: Initial ECG (with chest pain): RS 70 bpm, PR 160 msec, QRS 90 msec with 60o axis, suprathreshold < 0.5 mm in DI-AVL and tendency to ST-segment sublevel in DIII and AVF. No significant changes in subsequent electrocardiograms without chest pain. ECG (ED, without chest pain, with fever): RS 70 bpm, PR 160, QRS 90 msec, axis 60°, ST elevation of 1mm in DI, aVL, DII with negative T in III and aVF and ST rectification in V4-V5. ECG at discharge: RS at 66 bpm. PR 160 msec. Narrow QRS. Normal electrical axis. ST elevation of 0.5 mm in I, aVL with inferior rectification. Q wave in aVL. Blood tests: On admission (ED): glucose: 144 mg/dl, urea: 27 mg/dl, creatinine: 0.74 mg/dl, Na 139.3 mmol/l, K 3.84 mmol/l, CRP 8.9 mg/dl. Venous gases: pH 7.41, pCO2 40, HCO3 35.7, EB 0.7. Leukocytes 8990, N 77.7%, haemoglobin 13 g/dl, haematocrit 39.5%, platelets 354,000, INR 1. Urine toxins: positive for benzodiazepines, rest negative. Control: total cholesterol 182mg/dl, HDL 42cmg/dl, LDL 124 mg/dl, TGC 79 mg/dl, liver profile normal. CRP 6.7 mg/l, TSH 1.35 mU/l, Hb 1AC 5.6%. Evolution of myocardial necrosis markers: ultrasensitive troponin I 22,973 pg/ml on admission -> 15,255 pg/ml on discharge. CK 589 U/l on admission -> 85U/l on discharge. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, without alterations of the pulmonary parenchyma, free costophrenic and cardiophrenic sinuses. Admission portable echocardiogram: LV neither dilated nor hypertrophied with preserved global contractility and altered relaxation. Left atrium (LA) slightly dilated. No structural or functional valvular alterations of note. Non-dilated right chambers with preserved ventricular contractility. Absence of indirect data indicative of significant pulmonary hypertension (PH). Control echocardiogram (before discharge): unchanged with respect to previous study. Coronary angiography: right radial. Right dominance. Coronary arteries without significant angiographic lesions. CMR (15 days after discharge): study in the late phase after contrast administration shows subepicardial gadolinium uptake in inferomedial, inferolateromedial, anterolateral basal and anterior basal and middle and intramyocardial anterolateral middle and apical segments. Normal systolic function. Conclusion: myocarditis with fibrosis in the described segments.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During her admission to the coronary unit, she remained asymptomatic, coronary angiography performed 12 hours after admission ruled out obstructive coronary artery disease. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed 24 hours later, with normal biventricular function persisting, without segmental contractility defects or pericardial effusion. Myocardial injury markers remained elevated in plateau for the next 48 hours. Platelet antiplatelet therapy was maintained with acetylsalicylic acid, due to suspicion of NOCA-PT, and ACE inhibitors were started due to a tendency to hypertension (HT) with good tolerance, as well as a high-potency statin. The clinical evolution was satisfactory, remaining haemodynamically stable without signs of heart failure, afebrile, without anginal recurrence and without ventricular arrhythmias on continuous cardiac monitoring. Since CMR was not possible during admission, he was scheduled for outpatient surgery 15 days later. CMR showed anterolateral and inferior subepicardial fibrosis compatible with clinical suspicion of myocarditis, so antiplatelet treatment and statin was withdrawn. During follow-up, the patient suffered some epigastric discomfort with a non-coronary profile and palpitations, with no evidence of ventricular arrhythmias on Holter and normal residual ventricular function.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocarditis. Preserved left ventricular systolic function without segmental alterations. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  44-year-old woman.  History No cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) or toxic habits. Obstetric history: two miscarriages, several assisted reproduction processes and one spontaneous delivery. Hysterectomy and double adnexectomy for endocervical adenocarcinoma. She does not undergo treatment on a regular basis.   Current illness No previous cardiological symptoms. On the day of admission, she consulted the emergency department for an episode of intense and prolonged chest tightness (1 hour), radiating to the neck and upper limbs, while walking, without associated vegetative cortex. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed showing an inferolateral subendocardial lesion and serum markers of myocardial damage were found to be elevated. Admission to cardiology for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without ST elevation.   Physical examination On arrival, haemodynamically stable with blood pressure 120/60 mmHg, heart rate 65 bpm. No jugular venous engorgement. Normal cardiorespiratory auscultation, no murmurs. Lower limbs without oedema. Radial and femoral pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: haemoglobin 12.6 g/dl, platelets 199,000 x 10^3/μl, leukocytes 6,220 x 10^3/μl with normal formula. Coagulation: TTPa Ratio 1,08, INR 1,03. Biochemistry: glucose 104 mg/dl; urea 24.6 mg/dl, creatinine 0.61 mg/dl, sodium 145 mEq/l, potassium 4.33 mEq/l, initial TnT 54 ng/l, peak 134 ng/l (normal < 15 ng/l), glycosylated haemoglobin 5.9%, total cholesterol 203 mg/dl, HDL 59 mg/dl, LDL 124 mg/dl, TG 98 mg/dl, non-HDL 143 mg/dl. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (nasopharyngeal exudate): negative. Emergency ECG: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Normal and constant PR. Narrow QRS, normal axis. Scarce R wave progression in precordial leads, inferolateral subendocardial lesion with subepicardial ischaemia. Chest X-ray in the emergency department: normal cardiothoracic index, free costophrenic sinuses, no parenchymal infiltrates, no bone or pleural alterations. ECG on the cardiology ward, first admission: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm. Normal and constant PR. Narrow QRS. Subepicardial lesion of up to 4 mm in the anterior face. First emergency catheterisation: left main coronary artery (LMCA) without lesions. Anterior descending artery (ADA) with diffuse lumen involvement and occlusion at the beginning of the distal segment with TIMI 0 distal flow, suggesting spontaneous haematoma dissection. Circumflex artery (Cx) with diffuse involvement of the lumen also, somewhat more marked in the middle third. Right coronary artery (RCA) dominant, with no lesions and smooth contours. Angioplasty on RCA: the guidewire progresses but appears to be in false lumen. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed, which confirmed that it was a coronary dissection with haematoma from the origin of the artery, and that the guidewire was in false lumen, with collapsed true lumen. An attempt was made to pass the guidewire to the true lumen with a Sasuke double lumen catheter, but without success. IVUS was repeated and the patient recovered distal TIMI 3 flow, with spiroid dissection of the ADA in the mid-distal third. As the patient had no chest pain and isoelectric ST, it was decided not to continue with the intervention. Angio-CT of the supra-aortic trunks and aorta: study within the normal range. The ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta and their visceral branches showed no abnormalities. Emergency ECG, readmission: sinus rhythm 60 bpm. Normal and constant PR. Narrow QRS, axis at 0o. Subepicardial lesion in high lateral face with associated subepicardial ischaemia, specular descent in inferior face, subendocardial lesion in anterior face with subepicardial ischaemia up to V4. Second emergency catheterisation: small calibre LMCA due to intramural haematoma verified by IVUS extending towards LAD and Cx with involvement of proximal segments of both. LAD with intramural haematoma up to the beginning of the middle segment where a double lumen is seen, similar to the final result of previous PCI, with TIMI 3 flow and proven by IVUS. Cx with intramural haematoma compressing its lumen and causing a pseudo-occlusion of the marginal branch (previously not present) with TIMI 1 flow (lesion responsible). Dominant ACD, intramural haematoma type: guidewire progresses to ADA, Cx and OM. PCI is performed with simple balloon in OM (Pantera pro 2 x 20 mm at 8 atm) and in Cx, then by cutting balloon (Wolverine 2 x 10 mm at 12 atm) with kissing, and ends with simple balloon in Cx somewhat more distal due to displacement of the haematoma (Mozec 1.5 x 15 mm at 8 atm). Coronary CT angiography (images 4 A and B): Coronary CT angiography (after second admission): Thrombosis of the false lumen is observed in the IVC, which conditions the filiform calibre of the true lumen. DA proximal proximal third filiform lumen due to thrombosis of the false lumen. Cx thrombosis of the false lumen and the proximal proximal proximal lumen. Control coronary CT angiography (at 3 weeks): TCI: short with normalisation of the luminal diameter. ADA: notable improvement in vessel calibre with persistence only at the ostial level of thrombosis of the false lumen. Intimal flap still present from the middle 1/3 with good filling of the distal vessel. Cx: normalisation of the vessel lumen with no evident signs of dissection at present. ACD: no evidence of lesions or images of dissection. DP and PL branches without lesions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his stay on the cardiology ward he presented with angina at rest with vegetative cortex and in the ECG an anterior subepicardial lesion of up to 4 mm in V2, for which urgent coronary angiography was performed where, with the aid of IVUS, an image of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCD) with mural haematoma was observed extending from LMCA towards Cx with TIMI 3 flow and towards the LAD with distal occlusion. Final TIMI 3 flow was achieved after passing the angioplasty guidewire without stent implantation, but spiroid dissection persisted in the mid-distal segment. Angio-CT of the supra-aortic and aortic trunks was performed without detecting extracoronary vascular lesions, at discharge echocardiography without segmentarism and with preserved ejection fraction. The possibility of an underlying antiphospholipid syndrome was not ruled out, so after completing 1 week of double antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation, he was discharged with acetylsalicylic acid and low molecular weight heparin until the hypercoagulability study was completed. However, two days after discharge from hospital, she went to the emergency department for oppressive chest pain radiating to the upper limbs with vegetative cortex, in ECG lateral subepicardial lesion, activating AMI code. Coronary angiography with progression of dissection to LMCA verified by IVUS, intramural haematoma in circumflex artery causing pseudo-occlusion of marginal branch (culprit lesion); angioplasty with simple balloon and cutting balloon was performed with resolution of the occlusion. A coronary angio-CT scan was performed 3 weeks apart, the first during the last admission, and after discharge home, showing an improvement in the intramural haematoma, with persistent intimal flap from the middle third of the anterior descending artery and thrombosis of the false lumen at the proximal anterior descending artery. On discharge, double antiplatelet therapy was maintained for 3 months until a subsequent review, and treatment was prescribed with statins, beta-blockers and nitrates.  DIAGNOSIS Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in the left coronary tree due to intramural haematoma:  Acute myocardial infarction with anterior ST elevation. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection with occlusion of distal anterior descending artery, recovery of TIMI 3 flow by low-pressure balloon angioplasty and coronary guidewire without stent implantation. 90 minutes of ischaemia.

Lipoma measuring 10 x 5 mm on the inferior aspect of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cervical degenerative changes. Other structures included in the study, with no other significant findings. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angio-MRI (images 2, 3 and 4): scan performed without and after administration of IVC: there are multiple foci of diffusion restriction due to acute ischaemia distributed dispersed throughout the right midbrain territory with both cortical and deep involvement. Although smaller in number and volume, there were also multiple foci of acute ischaemia in the posterior border territory of the left hemisphere. No signs of haemorrhagic complications. Vascular examination showed no significant stenotic pathology in supra-aortic trunks or structures of the polygon of Willis. Holter: sinus rhythm throughout the recording.

Vibrating, filamentous mass of intermediate echorefringence, approximately 6 x 2.5 mm in size on the ventricular side of the aortic valve, suggestive of papillary fibroelastoma. Normal transvalvular aortic flow. Left aortic valve free of thrombus. No shunt through the interatrial septum after administration of agitated saline. The rest of the study is superimposable to the transthoracic examination.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In summary, this is a 71-year-old man who was admitted to the neurology department for a picture of neurological focality of sudden onset consisting of weakness of the right lower and upper limbs and facial asymmetry, with progressive resolution during hospitalisation. As for the aetiological study, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cortical and deep ischaemic lesions in the territory of both middle cerebral arteries. In view of the suspected cardioembolic aetiology, the cardiology department was contacted to complete the study. During her hospital stay, electrocardiographic monitoring by Holter, which showed no arrhythmias suggestive of causing the current clinical picture, and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, the latter showing a lesion in the aortic valve compatible with papillary fibroelastoma. After finding evidence of this lesion, the cardiac surgery department was contacted to assess the case. Given the symptoms of embolic origin consisting of ischaemic involvement of the right and left middle cerebral arteries, surgery was performed consisting of resection of the tumour, without the need for valve repair. In successive outpatient check-ups, the patient was asymptomatic, with no evidence of new embolic phenomena.  DIAGNOSIS Biterritorial ischaemic stroke (both middle cerebral arteries) of cardioembolic aetiology secondary to aortic fibroelastoma. |O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  39-year-old woman, primigravida at 9 weeks, with a personal history of grade II obesity and severe aortic insufficiency, who underwent surgery at the age of 24 using the Tyrone-David technique (replacement of ascending aorta with valve repair). At the age of 29, a new operation with implantation of a metallic aortic prosthesis. Usually anticoagulated with acenocoumarol, at the beginning of pregnancy she started treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with a regimen of enoxaparin 12,000 IU (120 mg)/0.8 ml once a day. In addition, he suffers from hypothyroidism and is treated with levothyroxine 150 mcg per day. After waking up in the morning, she began to feel pain in the left cervical region and a significant sensation of corkiness in the homolateral side of the face, associated with moderate precordial pain radiating to the left shoulder, together with vomiting. Due to a feeling of general malaise, 2 hours after the onset of symptoms, she decided to return to bed and after sleeping for approximately 30 minutes she awoke without facial paresthesia, however, given that she continued with central thoracic discomfort, she decided to consult the emergency services. There, haemodynamic stability was observed with blood pressure of 117/63, heart rate of 70 bpm, afebrile state and baseline oxygen saturation of 92%. The neurological examination ruled out focality at that time. Cranial nerves were preserved and pupils were isochoric and normoreactive. There was rhythmic cardiac auscultation with metallic click, without murmurs and respiratory auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur without added noises. The abdomen is soft, depressible and painless and the lower limbs show no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. On arrival, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, showing ST-segment rectification in the inferior face of approximately 0.5 mm, and the patient was transferred to the monitored observation room. Following the results of the first analysis, which showed elevated markers of myocardial damage, the on-call cardiologist was consulted. On evaluation, a new ECG was performed with negative T waves in leads V5-V6 and in II, III and aVF. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing inferoapical and apical segmental contractility defects. An attempt was made to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram to assess the mechanical aortic prosthesis, ruling out thrombosis. Due to the analytical, echo and electrocardiographic findings, a diagnosis of high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) was made and early coronary angiography was requested, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for continuous monitoring.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Initial ECG: sinus rhythm at 74 bpm, normal axis, isoelectric ST, flattened T waves in III and aVF but positive. ECG on admission to ICU: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, normal axis, development of negative T waves in II, III, aVF and from V3 to V6. ST elevation 1 mm in III and rectification in aVF. CBC: haemogram: leukocytes 7.7 thousands/μl, segmented (74%) 5.7 thousands/μl, lymphocytes (18.5%) 1.4 thousands/μl, red cells 4.23 million/μl, haemoglobin 13 g/dl, haematocrit 38.5%, MCV 91.1 fl, platelets 180 thousands/μl. Coagulation: prothrombin time 12.9 seconds, prothrombin activity 80.0 %, aTTP 37.2 seconds, fibrinogen 638 mg/dl, INR 1.17 INR. Biochemistry: glucose 87 mg/dl, urea 10 mg/dl, creatinine 0.51 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate (MDRD-4- IDMS) > 60 ml/min/1.73, sodium 136 mmol/l, potassium 3.5 mmol/l, chlorine 107 mmol/l, magnesium 1.96 mg/dl. Peak myocardial damage markers: CPK 783 IU/l, TnIhs: 6953.3 ng/l. Anti Xa levels: 1st determination: 0.71 IU/mL; 2nd determination: 0.8 IU/mL. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle without significant hypertrophy, subjectively preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with dyskinesia in the apex, distal inferior and distal septal, with normal diastolic pattern. No mitral valvulopathy. Left atrium not dilated. Mechanical aortic prosthesis with very discrete lavage jets and with parameters of GPAo 26 mmHg, GMAo 12 mmHg, LVOT LVOT/Ao ratio of 0.6 (no stenosis). Right ventricle (RV) not dilated with normal systolic function, no tricuspid insufficiency (TI) to estimate pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP), no pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) (videos 1 and 2): no thrombosis of aortic mechanical prosthesis. Left aortic valve without thrombus inside. Non-dilated LV with no thrombus inside. Preferential coronary angiography: left dominance. Left main coronary artery without significant stenosis. Anterior descending artery of good calibre and development, with an image compatible with an embolus in the very distal section, in the apex and when the vessel is already of fine calibre. Circumflex artery of good calibre and development, dominant, angiographically normal. Right coronary artery of small calibre and development, non-dominant, without lesions. Absence of significant atherosclerotic lesions. CT scan of the aorta: the metallic aortic valve prosthesis and the post-surgical changes of the aortic root in the first 40 mm are observed. Along the entire length of the ascending aorta there is a constant diameter of 30 mm. Although optimal aortic lumen density has not been reached in the images obtained, there are no radiological findings suggestive of dissection along the aorta or its TSA. No other radiologically significant findings were found with this imaging technique.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring. Prior to coronary angiography, the on-call gynaecology team was contacted and the patient was informed of the benefits/risks of the procedure and warned that due to the average radiation dose received per patient (less than 500 mGy), it was not advisable to legally terminate the pregnancy. The haemodynamics department was then contacted to perform a preferential catheterisation, which identified an angiographic image suggestive of embolism in the very distal anterior descending coronary artery. Subsequently, obstetric ultrasound was performed, which confirmed foetal viability. On admission, aortic CT angiography was requested to detect aortic dissection and/or brachiocephalic and carotid trunk dissection, which was finally ruled out. His stay in the ICU was uneventful. The haematology department was consulted to adjust the anticoagulation dose which, prior to admission, was maintained at 12,000 IU (120 mg)/0.8 ml once a day. The anticoagulant treatment was adjusted to 10,000 IU (100 mg)/1 ml every 12 hours and the patient was transferred to the cardiology ward, where antiXa levels were requested and showed borderline levels between prophylactic and therapeutic doses. The most likely aetiology of NSTEACS was assumed to be coronary embolism in relation to the undercoagulated mechanical prosthesis, which in addition to releasing a small embolus into the coronary circulation, could possibly have released one into the cerebral circulation, causing the facial paresthesia and cervical pain. After a multidisciplinary approach between the gynaecology, cardiology and haematology teams, it was decided that since the patient was still in the first trimester of pregnancy, treatment with LMWH should continue until week 13 (adjusted according to anti-Xa levels) and then reintroduce vitamin K antagonists (VKA) until delivery. Her stay in the cardiology ward was uneventful and she was discharged after 5 days of hospitalisation.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocardial infarction without septal and apical ST elevation in relation to embolism at the level of the very distal anterior descending coronary artery. Possible transient ischaemic attack. Undertherapeutic anticoagulation levels in a patient with a mechanical aortic prosthesis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 49-year-old woman, with no known allergies or toxic habits. Lives at home with her parents, under guardianship, independent for basic activities of daily living (BADLL). No cardiovascular risk factors or family history of heart disease. Cardiological history of mitral prolapse with moderate mitral insufficiency under follow-up in cardiology consultations. Other history of: cognitive deficit secondary to intrauterine infection, micrognathia and psoriasis without associated osteoarthritis. No treatment as usual.   Current illness Admission to cardiology, after detecting in outpatient clinic, where he went for review of his valvulopathy, ECG compatible with evolved AMI with anteroseptal Q wave, paucisymptomatic. Anamnesis was difficult due to the patient's baseline condition; we spoke to her parents, who reported that she had presented at home in the previous days with episodes of epigastric pain and diffuse abdominal pain, which subsided with paracetamol 1g/8h, and for which they did not consult, without associated vegetative cortex. They denied objective dyspnoea, chest pain or syncope. There was no fever or associated infectious semiology at any level. Likewise, for approximately two weeks, the patient has had clinical symptoms of instability with behavioural alterations, pending an appointment for neurological assessment.   Physical examination Blood pressure 120/75 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm. Baseline O2 saturation 98%. Afebrile. Conscious, oriented, normohydrated and perfused, eupneic at rest. Cachexia (body mass index 15). No jugular ingurgitation at 45o. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, known mitral II/VI systolic murmur. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, preserved peristalsis, painful on general palpation, no signs of peritoneal irritation, no murmurs. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. No loss of skin continuity.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on admission: sinus tachycardia at 127 bpm. ST elevation V1-V4 Q in V1 V2. ECG on discharge: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, with negative T waves from V1 to V4. Myocardial necrosis markers: ultrasensitive troponin T: 1050 -> 968.8 ng/l. Blood tests: biochemistry: glucose 120 mg/dl, HbA1c 5.5%, urea 0.5 g/l, creatinine 1 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate 90 ml/min. Total cholesterol 112 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 54 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 45 mg/dl, triglycerides 83 mg/dl, sodium140 mEq/l, potassium 4 mEq/l. TSH 0.6 mcU/ml. Blood count: haemoglobin 14.2 g/dl, haematocrit 40%, leucocytes 6400/mm3, platelets 305000/mm3. Coagulation: AP 75%, INR 1, fibrinogen 465 mg/dl. Chest X-ray: normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Hiatal hernia. Bilateral apical fibrocystic fibrocystic tracts. No acute pleuroparenchymal alterations. Myocardial perfusion scan at rest: non-viability. Myocardial necrosis in the apex and anteroapical and anteroseptal segments (infarct area between 16% and 22% of the left ventricular area; LVEF 53%). Coronary computed tomography (CT): occlusion of the middle anterior descending artery (AD) with permeable and filiform apical bed. AMI in the anterior and apical septum (thinning and hypoperfusion in the apex and anterior septum). No perivalvular abscesses are observed. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on admission: apical akinesia with preserved systolic function (LVEF 55%). Mass visualised on the atrial side of the anterior leaflet in the mitral valve suggestive of vegetations, hypermobile, 1.17/0.5 cm in size, filiform with a wide base of implantation that conditions moderate-severe mitral insufficiency (A2-P3) with posterior eccentric jet and Coanda effect, without systolic inversion in the pulmonary veins. No perforation of the leaflet or mitroaortic fibrosis was observed. There is no mitral valve stenosis. Dilated left atrium. Thin layer of pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram at 6 weeks: left ventricle of normal size and thickness, with borderline systolic function (LVEF 50%). Akinesia and apical thinning. Moderate left atrial dilatation. Normal right chambers. Remarkable decrease in the size of the vegetation in the anterior mitral leaflet (almost complete disappearance). Mitral valve prolapse of the anterior leaflet causing moderate regurgitation with eccentric jet (similar to studies prior to admission). No perforation of the leaflet or involvement of the mitroaortic fibrosa was observed. The rest of the patient had no significant valvular alterations. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure cannot be calculated due to the absence of tricuspid insufficiency. Aortic root of normal size. No pericardial effusion. Microbiology: Blood cultures 25/01/2020: Streptococcus anginosus. Urine culture 25/01/2020: negative. PCR influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 07/02/2020: negative. Urine culture 07/02/2020: Escherichia coli. Blood cultures on 28/01, 05/02, 07/02 and 11/02/2020: negative. Abdominal CT scan: hiatus hernia. Uterine myoma of 14 mm. Rest without alterations. Craniocerebral CT scan: hyperdense area compatible with haemorrhagic focus of 10 x 7 mm in left fronto-parietal lobe, which does not rule out the existence of underlying pathology. Rest of the brain parenchyma without significant alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: left occipital annular uptake that could be related to septic embolism, as well as left occipital temporal temporal corticojuxtacortical signal alteration suggesting acute-subacute ischaemic lesion and left frontal subacute haemorrhagic focus. In context, the findings could all be related to septic embolism.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Admitted with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, paucisymptomatic. In the first hours of hospitalisation he presented febrile peaks of up to 38oC, with no associated infectious semiology, so blood and urine cultures were requested, PCR for respiratory viruses and empirical antibiotic therapy was started, which was modified after growth of S. anginosus in the first 24 hours in both blood cultures, to intravenous penicillin G sodium and intravenous gentamicin. TTE showed apical akinesia with preserved LVEF and an image suggestive of vegetation in the anterior mitral leaflet (atrial side) of 11 mm, which led to moderate regurgitation with eccentric jet. Of note, it was impossible to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram due to the patient's facial anatomy. On the one hand, in the case of a recently diagnosed advanced acute myocardial infarction, a viability study was performed with myocardial perfusion scintigraphy at rest, showing an absence of viability in the segments compatible with the LAD territory. A coronary CT scan was also performed, confirming occlusion in the mid LAD with a permeable and filiform apical bed. It was decided not to revascularise due to the absence of clinical benefit, and the patient remained stable without new episodes of chest pain. Residual LV systolic function was preserved with apical akinesia at discharge. On the other hand, with the diagnosis of subacute endocarditis in native mitral valve, together with the initial clinical manifestations of instability and behavioural alteration, as well as diffuse abdominal pain, an extension study was performed with: Cranioencephalic CT and cerebral MRI which confirmed the existence of images suggestive of septic embolisms and abdominal CT where no significant alterations were found. Both ruled out the presence of abscesses. A gynaecological examination was also performed, which ruled out abscess or complications at this level.  Subsequent clinical and haemodynamic evolution was favourable, with negative blood cultures at 72 hours, presenting as a complication urinary tract infection by E coli and Enterococcus faecium 2 weeks after starting antibiotherapy, for which treatment was escalated, replacing penicillin with ceftriaxone, completing 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment, with no other complications. After completing the 6 weeks, a new control TTE was repeated, where the vegetation practically disappeared, with prolapse of the anterior mitral leaflet leading to moderate residual mitral insufficiency similar to previous studies and preserved left ventricular systolic function. Given the absence of progression of mitral regurgitation (MR) and the disappearance of valvular vegetations in a frail patient (FRAIL 5; CFS 7), conservative treatment was chosen. Finally, after completion of the physiotherapy programme by the rehabilitation service, with progressive recovery of motor function, she was discharged home with outpatient follow-up, with no episodes of decompensation to date and in NYHA functional class I at the last review.  DIAGNOSIS Subacute endocarditis on native mitral valve (anterior leaflet) due to Streptococcus anginosus (viridans) resolved with prolonged antibiotic therapy and complicated with septic embolism:  Acute embolic apical myocardial infarction with occlusion in middle LAD not revascularised due to lack of viability. Left occipital and left frontotemporal ischaemic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (with subsequent haemorrhagic transformation) due to septic embolisms.  Borderline residual LV systolic function (LVEF 50%) with apical akinesia.  Urinary tract infections due to E coli and Enterococcus faecium. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 49-year-old male patient with the following personal history: No known adverse drug reactions. Cardiovascular risk factors: arterial hypertension of 13 years of evolution, initially untreated and which, in recent years, has had treatment with irregular adherence to it; dyslipidaemia of 8 years of evolution, in treatment with oral lipid-lowering drugs, but also with irregular adherence to it. Toxic habits: active smoker of more than 15 cigarettes a day (IPA of 35 packs/year), alcoholism with a regular consumption of around 1 litre of beer a day since adolescence, occasional cocaine user.   Cardiological history: Chronic coronary syndrome, with debut in 2012 in the form of acute myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation (NSTEMI). During this admission, monovalvular coronary artery disease of the proximal anterior descending artery was detected, which was revascularised with the implantation of 1 drug-eluting stent. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was preserved at discharge. New admission in 2017 for NSTEMI, caused by thrombosis at the level of the proximal ostial circumflex artery without total obstruction and treated with abciximab perfusion initially and subsequently with balloon PCI. Left ventricular systolic function preserved. Abandoned follow-up in cardiology outpatient clinic.   Usual treatment: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg (1 tablet every 24 h), omeprazole 20 mg (1 tablet every 24 h), telmisartan 40 mg (1 tablet every 24 h), lorazepam 1 mg (1 tablet every 12 h), bisoprolol 2.5 mg (1 tablet every 24 h), atorvastatin 80 mg (1 tablet every 24 h), fenofibrate 145 mg (1 tablet every 24 h).   Present illness The patient, with the history described above, presents with chest pain at home, unrelated to exertion. He describes the pain as central thoracic, oppressive, radiating to the neck and left upper limb, similar to the two previous heart attacks and accompanied by vegetative symptoms in the form of profuse sweating and nausea. Initially, he decided to take one tablet of lorazepam and, as his symptoms worsened, he decided to take two tablets of sublingual caffeine, which he vomited immediately. The family then called the emergency services. On arrival of the emergency team, the patient was symptomatic, with chest pain and significant impairment of the general condition, conscious, oriented and cooperative, with the following physical examination: Vitals: systolic blood pressure of 95/54 mmHg; heart rate of around 100 bpm, saturating at 96% without oxygen supply. Skin pallor, acral coldness, weak peripheral pulses. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones, tachycardic, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: bilateral vesicular murmur preserved, with crackles in the bases. Lower limbs: no oedema. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was then performed, showing ST segment elevation (images 1 and 2), so it was decided to administer a loading dose of ASA (300 mg), ticagrelor (180 mg), and emergency cardiology was contacted pre-hospital for transfer to our hospital.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Emergency ECG: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, normal PR, ST segment elevation in DII, DIII, AVF (up to 7 mm) and in V4-6, with specular decrease in V1-2, aVL. Initial coronary angiography (video 1): Left main coronary artery: No stenosis. Recurrence of very late thrombosis of the stent implanted in the ostial anterior descending artery, a phenomenon that in this case affects the distal left main coronary artery (both anterior descending and circumflex), but maintaining TIMI 3 epicardial flow in both branches. Anterior descending: permeable ostial-proximal ostial stent, not restenotic, with presence of ostial thrombus. Rest of the vessel without de novo lesions. Occlusion by embolisation of the anterior descending artery at the terminal (apical) level. Circumflex: co-dominant, without lesions, with presence of ostial-proximal thrombus, as previously detailed. Occlusion by embolus of the distal posterior descending artery of the circumflex. Right coronary artery: codominant, without lesions. Post-catheterisation ECG on admission to the coronary unit (image 3): sinus rhythm with narrow QRS, normalisation of the ST segment, Q wave of 1 mm in DII, DIII, aVF, V5-6.  Admission blood tests: haemogram: red series with Hb 15.7 g/dl and haematocrit 45.8%. White series with leukocytosis of 17,760 cells/mm3 and neutrophilia of 15,590 cells/mm3. Platelets 261,000 cells/mm3. Blood glucose: 74 mg/dl. Renal function: creatinine 1.04 mg/dl and urea 33 mg/dl. Ions within normal range. CRP 0.6 mg/l. Myocardial damage markers: CPK 365 - 1283 - 2487 - 731 - 203 - 142 - 83 - 87 U/l. Ultra-sensitive troponin T: 11 - 904 - 2166 - 871 - 1484 - 1069 - 1429 - 10 - 5 ng/l. GSV: pH 7.25; pCO2 40.4 mmHg; lactic acid 7.4 mmol/l; HCO3- 17.7 mmol/l. HbA1c: 5.6%. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 103 mg/dl; triglycerides 92 mg/dl; HDL cholesterol 60 mg/dl; LDL cholesterol 25 mg/dl. Urinalysis with toxins: positive for cocaine and benzodiazepines. Echocardiography in the ED: left ventricle of globular appearance, with preserved LVEF, no segmental contractility disorders can be seen due to poor endocardial visualisation. Right ventricle of normal size and preserved systolic function. No significant valvulopathies. No pericardial effusion. Vena cava of normal size and with adequate inspiratory collapse. Control coronary angiography at 7 days: resolution of the stent thrombosis generated in the ostial anterior descending artery, described in the previous angiography, was confirmed. Doppler ultrasound of the left groin: hypoechogenic image is seen in the perivascular soft tissues, adjacent to the superficial femoral artery, with no flow inside, compatible with changes secondary to puncture, probably haematic infiltration. No significant post-puncture haematoma is evident. All the vessels studied appear permeable and with normal flow morphology. There were no images suggesting additional complications: arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm. ECG at hospital discharge: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Constant PR of 100 ms. Narrow QRS of 80 ms. Negative T waves in II, III, aVF and V4-6. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at discharge: non-dilated left ventricle, with slight concentric hypertrophy of walls (13 mm of septum and 13 mm of posterior wall), with preserved left ventricular systolic function (57%), without segmental contractility disorders. Right ventricle not dilated and normofunctioning. Atria of normal dimensions. Normal aortic root. Absence of organic valvular pathology. No pericardial effusion. Inferior vena cava not dilated with adequate inspiratory collapse. The Doppler study showed normal anterograde valvular flows, with no significant valvular insufficiencies. Blood tests at discharge: Normal haemogram of the 3 series. Coagulation normal. Biochemistry: glycaemia, renal function and ions normal. Markers of myocardial damage: CPK 87 U/l and TnT 5 ng/l. CRP 1.2 mg/l. GSV: pH 7.37; pCO2 50.5 mmHg; HCO3 28.6 mmol/l; lactic 2.1 mmol/l.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the hospital emergency department, the patient was found to be in a very poor general state, hypotensive and with a low level of consciousness, which made it necessary to initiate aminergic support (noradrenaline) with a view to performing primary angioplasty in which thrombosis was observed in the area of the ostium of the anterior descending trunk and trunk-circumflex. As in the NSTEACS of 2017, initial pharmacological management was chosen in order to reduce the thrombotic burden prior to any interventional procedure. Thus, an intracoronary bolus of abciximab was administered and intravenous perfusion was left in place. After starting this treatment, haemodynamic improvement and recovery of the level of consciousness was observed, and the patient was transferred to the coronary unit for continued monitoring and follow-up. The case was presented at a medical-surgical session and it was decided to repeat the coronary angiography after 7 days, depending on the results of the coronary angiography, medical treatment, percutaneous revascularisation or surgery could be considered depending on the findings. During his stay, initially in the coronary unit and subsequently in the cardiology ward, the patient evolved favourably in clinical and haemodynamic terms, with no congestive signs, no arrhythmic events, no recurrence of chest pain and with preserved LVEF without complications in the control TTE. On re-history, the patient reported that in the previous weeks he had increased his alcohol and tobacco consumption, and that he had used cocaine again on several occasions, the last dose the day before the event. A repeat coronary angiography was performed 7 days later, in this case via the femoral artery, and resolution of the thrombus was observed. In view of this situation, it was decided not to perform any more invasive procedures on this patient and, after an adequate evolution on the hospital ward, it was decided to discharge the patient with recommendations, leaving him on a double anti-aggregation treatment with ASA and ticagrelor. Prior to discharge, the patient presented a painful tumour in the inguinal region, coinciding with the puncture site for coronary angiography via the femoral artery, which made it necessary to perform a Doppler ultrasound to rule out complications of the procedure. After performing the ultrasound and ruling out these complications, the patient was discharged from the hospital. Emphasis was placed on the importance of abandoning the consumption of toxic substances and the importance of therapeutic compliance. He was transferred to the cardiac rehabilitation unit on discharge, where these recommendations were insisted on, as well as diet and physical exercise. After follow-up, he was discharged with subsequent review in outpatient cardiology consultations. At the present time, and more than 1 year after the acute event, the patient has completely abandoned the consumption of toxic substances and has not presented any further coronary events. Given his history, it was also decided to prolong the double antiplatelet therapy, and the patient is currently on ticagrelor 60 mg every 12 hours.  DIAGNOSIS Inferolateral KK IV STEACS. Late stent thrombosis in ostial anterior descending artery affecting the left common trunk and the ostium of the circumflex artery with TIMI 3 flow but with distal embolisation with occlusion of distal anterior descending and distal posterior descending arteries. Pharmacological treatment with intracoronary abciximab and later triple antiplatelet therapy with intravenous abciximab and ASA + ticagrelor orally. Global preserved LVEF with no mechanical complications or valvular heart disease. Cocaine use as a precipitating factor. Active smoking and alcoholism. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 26-year-old male, high-intensity sportsman, firefighter by profession. No family history of heart disease or sudden death (SD) at an early age. No known drug allergies. No smoker or drinker. No consumption of other toxic substances. No known cardiovascular risk factors. No medical illnesses or surgical interventions of interest. No chronic treatment.  Current illness Patient attended the emergency department in March 2020 for an episode of dizziness associated with loss of vision and a fall to the floor while at rest, while making a sudden neck twisting movement, without knowing whether she lost consciousness. Immediate recovery with no post-critical period, no sphincter relaxation or tonic-clonic movements. She reported that this was the first time this symptomatology had occurred, denying previous syncopal episodes or palpitations.  Physical examination General state of health. Well hydrated and perfused. Athletic build. Eupneic at rest. Oxygen saturation 99% without oxygen therapy. Blood pressure (BP) 125/65 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 55 bpm. No jugular ingurgitation. No adenopathies. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, at a good frequency. No murmurs or audible extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, non-painful, no masses or megaliths. Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of venous insufficiency or deep vein thrombosis. Distal pulses present and symmetrical  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus bradycardia at 55 bpm, normal axis, short PR with marked pre-excitation (positive delta wave in I, inferior face and from V1-V6, negative in avL), wide QRS due to initial filling with RsR' morphology in V1 with marked repolarisation alterations with ST underleveling and negative T waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V6. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. No images suggestive of condensation. Free costophrenic sinuses. Normal lung parenchyma. CBC: haemoglobin 14.6 g/dl, leucocytes 7200/microl (67% PMN), platelets 365,000/microl. Coagulation: PT 80%. Biochemistry: creatinine 0.67 mg/dl, urea 28 mg/dl, ions normal. Hepatobiliary profile and thyroid hormones normal. Echocardiogram (videos 1 and 2): left ventricle not dilated, without ventricular hypertrophy but showing marked hypertrabeculation especially at the apical, lower apical, middle and lateral apical levels, with numerous intraventricular recesses which are checked by colour Doppler for communication with the ventricular cavity. LVEF at the limit of normality (LVEFbp 55%). No segmental contractility disorders. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic function: normal transmitral pattern with E/A ratio 1.4 and TDE 296 ms. Normal filling pressures (average E/E ́ 8, lateral E ́ 16 cm/s, medial E ́ 8.5 cm/s, LA < 34 ml/m2, IT < 2.8 m/s). Right ventricle of normal size with normal systolic function (TAPSE 23 mm). Normal left atrium. Normal right atrium. Normal size thoracic aorta. No valvulopathies. Pericardium without relevant findings. No intracavitary masses or thrombi. Inferior vena cava of adequate calibre and respiratory dynamics. Ergometry: Bruce MET protocol: 24. Excellent functional capacity. The test was stopped when the target heart rate (HR) was reached. No chest pain or dyspnoea during exercise. No dynamic changes suggestive of ischaemia. During the entire tracing, there was overt pre-excitation with secondary repolarisation alterations, which disappeared when the heart rate reached 170 bpm and the repolarisation alterations disappeared. Subsequently, during recovery, the patient remained without pre-excitation and without repolarisation alterations due to probable exhaustion of the accessory pathway. There were no arrhythmic events of interest. Adequate tension and chronotropic response. Conclusions: clinically and electrically negative for ischaemia. Pre-excitation that disappears at 170 bpm. Holter: RS study with HR between 24-43-95 bpm. Maximum pause of 3.7 seconds, intermittent pre-excitation. Occasional nodal rhythm. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): left ventricle (LV) slightly dilated with marked trabeculation of the myocardium, on all sides except the septum and basal segments that show less trabeculae. The ratio of non-compacted myocardium to compacted myocardium (NCM/CM) is greater than 2.3 with a maximum value of 4.3 in several segments. Global and segmental mobility are preserved. The EF measured with the Simpson method is 62%. VTDVI of 243 ml, indexed by body surface area of 124 ml/m2, VTSVI of 91.6 ml, indexed by body surface area of 47 ml/m2. Cardiac output of 10 l/min. There were deep crypts located at the inferior junction of both ventricles, another in the middle anteroseptal segment and the third at the level of the apical inferior segment. The right ventricle is neither dilated nor hypertrophic, with marked hypertrabeculation. Global and segmental mobility preserved. The EF measured with the Simpson method is 66%. Both atria are of normal size. The first-pass perfusion sequence shows no perfusion defect at rest. Late enhancement/viability sequence does not show gadolinium retention suggesting necrosis and/or fibrosis. Conclusion: non-compaction cardiomyopathy with involvement of both ventricles. Preserved biventricular function. Slight LV dilatation. Absence of fibrosis. ECG after ablation: sinus tachycardia at 105 bpm, normal axis, PR 146 ms, narrow QRS, non-pathological q wave in inferior face, ST rectification in inferior face and V5-V6 with negative T in inferior face, normal QTc.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was assessed in the emergency department by the cardiology service in the event of a syncopal episode, and an electrocardiogram was performed in sinus rhythm with short PR and a marked positive delta wave in inferior aspect and V1-V6 and negative in aVL, thus giving the impression of a left lateral accessory pathway. Laboratory tests and chest X-ray were performed, compatible with normality, as well as echocardiography showing a non-dilated left ventricle but with marked hypertrabeculation at the apical, apical lateral and lower middle and apical levels, with numerous recesses communicating with the ventricular cavity, with preserved LVEF, right ventricle of normal morphology and function and no significant valvulopathies (videos 1 and 2). Given the suspicion of non-compaction cardiomyopathy with left lateral accessory pathway, studies were completed with genetic study and screening of first-degree relatives and CMR (images 2, 3 and 4) which confirmed the presence of non-compaction cardiomyopathy with biventricular involvement, more marked in the left ventricle, which was slightly dilated and affected in all segments except the septum and basal segments, with a maximum ratio between non-compacted and compacted myocardium of 4.3. There are deep crypts located at the inferior junction of both ventricles, another in the mid anteroseptal segment and the third at the level of the apical inferior segment. The rest of the study was compatible with normality, with preserved biventricular systolic function and no fibrosis in the late enhancement sequence. The patient was referred to the arrhythmia and electrophysiology unit and underwent ergometry, reaching 24 METs, without arrhythmic events during the test and with marked pre-excitation during the start of the test, which disappeared when 170 bpm was reached, and remained without pre-excitation during recovery. A 24-hour Holter monitor was also performed, which showed the presence of intermittent pre-excitation but no arrhythmic events of interest. Based on the above, it was decided to perform an electrophysiological study (EPS) in May 2020, and programmed stimulation was performed with the finding of concentric decremental anterograde conduction at baseline (and, therefore, through the specific conduction system) which became eccentric and with an earlier ventriculogram at the left lateral level after infusion of isoproterenol (via the accessory pathway). Similarly, atrioventricular dissociation is observed at 600 ms in programmed retrograde pacing from the right ventricular apex, which changes to concentric decremental retrograde conduction after isoproterenol infusion. The anterograde refractory period of the pathway is measured and is 240 ms after isoproterenol infusion. No tachycardias are induced after baseline programmed atrial and ventricular pacing and after isoproterenol. Mitral annulus mapping was performed by retroaortic access, with radiofrequency ablation at the left anterolateral level, and ablation was effective with disappearance of pre-excitation in 2.5 seconds.  After ablation, the patient continued subsequent follow-up in the arrhythmia and electrophysiology unit, remaining asymptomatic in NYHA functional class I and without events in serial Holter monitoring, in sinus rhythm without pre-excitation in the baseline ECG although maintaining marked alterations in ventricular repolarisation. In October 2020, the results of the genetic study were obtained, identifying a previously undescribed variant in the ACTC1 gene (p.Pro260Leu), which could be associated with the patient's phenotype (non-compaction cardiomyopathy), although more information is needed to confirm this, and screening of first-degree relatives has yet to be completed.  DIAGNOSIS Non-compaction cardiomyopathy with biventricular involvement and preserved systolic function. Slight dilatation of the left ventricle. Left anterolateral accessory pathway with intermittent pre-excitation. Successful ablation of the pathway by radiofrequency. Variant of uncertain significance in the ACTC1 gene (p.Pro260Leu). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cardiological history: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with two electrical cardioversions (2016 and 2018). Other medical and surgical history: depressive disorder, essential thrombocythemia, severe neurotrophic corneal ulcer operated on. Usual treatment: fluoxetine 20 mg (1 tablet every day, started one month ago), lorazepam 1 mg (every day), acenocoumarol 1 mg (1 tablet every day and adjust according to controls), amiodarone 200 mg (1 tablet every other day), chlorthalidone 50 mg (1 tablet every day), irbesartan 300 mg (1 tablet every day), felodipine 5 mg (1 tablet every day), atorvastatin 20 mg (1 tablet every day), glimepiride 20 mg (1 tablet daily), linagliptin 5 mg (1 tablet daily), doxycycline 200 mg (1 capsule daily) and 1 tablet 100 mg (daily), moxifloxacin ophthalmic, paracetamol/tramadol 75/650 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), famotidine 20 mg (1 tablet daily), pantoprazole 20 mg (1 tablet daily), anagrelide 0.5 mg (2 tablets every 7 days).   Present illness The patient is an 80-year-old woman who comes to the point of continuous care (PAC) for symptoms of loss of consciousness the day before the consultation and on three occasions during the same, lasting approximately 30 seconds and complete spontaneous recovery. She also had a feeling of dizziness of the unsteadiness type and previous tinnitus, with no associated vegetative cortex. No palpitations. No semiology of heart failure. No chest pain. No infectious clinical manifestations due to equipment. During her stay in the PAC, she presented a new episode witnessed by the doctor, who defibrillated on evidence of pulseless ventricular fibrillation (PSVF) on the electrocardiogram - which we do not have - and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) manoeuvres for less than 5 minutes. After recovery of sinus rhythm, the patient was referred to the hospital emergency department. Once there, the critical box monitor showed a torsade de Pointes (TdP) rhythm, initiated by the phenomenon of R over T, self-limited for seconds, with presyncopal symptoms, so isoproterenol and magnesium sulphate perfusion was started. It was decided not to implant a temporary pacemaker due to the non-relapse of the arrhythmia with isoproterenol perfusion (the patient remained in sinus rhythm at 95 bpm) and was admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for monitoring and correction of triggering factors. Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 125/84 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 95 bpm, oxygen saturation 98% with FiO2 21%. Digital blood glucose 238 mg/dl. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. No signs of respiratory distress. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: regular, no audible murmurs. Vesicular murmur preserved, without added noises. Abdomen: soft and depressible, no palpable masses or organomegaly, not painful on palpation. No signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower limbs: no oedema. No signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Neurological: conscious and oriented. Glasgow 15. Mild bradypsychia. Language correct in form and content. Cranial nerves without alterations. Normal eye movements. Pupils isochoric, normoreactive. Strength and sensitivity of limbs preserved and symmetrical (5/5).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiograms (ECG): Health Centre: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, PR 160 ms, QRS 120 ms with morphology of complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB) and electrical axis at -60o, asymmetrical negative T waves in V3-V6, flattened T waves in I, II, III and aVL. QT 600 ms, QTc (Bazett) 639 ms. In the critical care unit: polymorphic ventricular tachycardia of the TdP type. On discharge from the cardiology ward: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm, PR 160 ms, QRS 160 ms with BCRDHH morphology and electrical axis at -60o, asymmetrical negative T waves in V1 and III. QT 480 ms, QTc 492 ms. Blood tests: haemoglobin 10.9 g/dl, MCV 81.6 fl, MCH 25.3 pg, MCHC 31 g/dl, leukocytes 10 10*9/l, neutrophils 8 10*9/l, lymphocytes 1 10*9/l, platelets 190 10*9/l. Coagulation: prothrombin time (PT) 16.3 sec. Quick's index 59%, INR 1.39. APTT 28 s. Biochemistry: glucose 137 mg/dl, sodium 136 mEq/l, potassium 2.9 mEq/l, magnesium 1.6 mg/dl, calcium corrected to albumin 8.1 mg/dl, chlorine 94 mEq/l total bilirubin 3.99 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 2.07 mg/dl, indirect bilirubin 1.92 mg/dl, alanine aminotransferase GPT 34 U/l, urea 91 mg/dl, creatinine 1.08 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) CKDEPI 48.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, C-reactive protein 7.1 mg/dl, ferritin 109 ng/dl, iron 47 g/dl, transferrin saturation index 15.2%, uric acid 10.2 mg/dl, protein 6.6 g/dl, TSH 2.3 mIU/l.  HF markers: Carbohydrate Ag. 125 (CA125) 154 IU/ml, NT-proBNP > 35,000 pg/ml. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.52 pCO2 40 mmHg, pO2 75 mmHg, HCO3a 32.7 mmol/l, O2SAT 95.7%, lactate 2.3 mmol/l. Transthoracic echocardiogram: concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Increased left ventricular volumes with global hypokinesia, more severe in lower segments, and severe depression of global systolic function (LVEF 32%). Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mitral filling pattern suggestive of increased end-diastolic pressure. Severe left atrial dilatation. Right ventricle with normal diameters and mild depression of global systolic function, mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI) with GP 31 mmHg. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated. Estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) 35 mmHg. Absence of pericardial effusion. Chest X-ray: very poorly inspired study. Increased bilateral perihilar alveolar raster, which could correspond to discrete oedema. There were no images suggestive of pulmonary consolidation. Free costophrenic sinuses. Cardiomegaly. Calcification of the aortic button. Degenerative changes in the dorsal spine. Coronary angiography: epicardial coronary arteries without lesions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During her stay in the OCU, the patient remained asymptomatic and electrocardiograms showed prolonged QT interval (QTc 639 ms), of probable iatrogenic acquired aetiology, as she was taking up to 3 drugs with known risk of TdP (moxifloxacin, anagrelide, amiodarone) and 4 that could be arrhythmogenic in specific conditions (fluoxetine, pantoprazole, famotidine and tramadol). In addition, blood tests showed mild hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia, electrolyte disorders that predispose to prolongation of the QT interval. For all these reasons, it was decided to discontinue the predisposing medication and to supplement magnesium, calcium and potassium to correct their plasma levels. After 48 hours of monitoring without new episodes and correction of the QTc to 540 ms, it was decided to transfer him to the cardiology ward to complete treatment and study (HF with severe ventricular dysfunction with moderate mitral insufficiency (MI) on regular echocardiography). During her stay in the cardiology ward, coronary angiography was performed to complete the study of dilated cardiomyopathy without any pathological findings. The patient progressed favourably and due to clinical and haemodynamic stability and correction of the electrocardiographic alteration, after 19 days in hospital it was decided to discharge her home with subsequent monitoring and follow-up by the heart failure unit. Pharmacological treatment was started for HF with reduced LVEF (sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg [1 tablet every 12 h], eplerenone 25 mg [1 tablet every 24 h], nebivolol 2.5 mg [0.5 tablet every 24 h], dapagliflozin 10 mg [1 tablet every 24 h], furosemide 40 mg [1 tablet every 24 h]) together with magnesium 53 mg [2 tablets every 12 h] and edoxaban 30 mg [1 tablet every 24 h]. Similarly, it was decided to discontinue drugs precipitating QT interval prolongation (fluoxetine, moxifloxacin, amiodarone, pantoprazole and famotidine). In the cardiology outpatient follow-up, one month after discharge home, and after optimal medical treatment of HF, the patient showed clinical stability with no recurrence of HF, partial recovery of LVEF (current LVEF 40%) and QT interval within normal limits. Therefore, the patient is labelled as non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a tachycardiomyopathy component and treatment is maintained at the appropriate doses.  DIAGNOSIS Iatrogenic acquired prolonged QT interval (pharmacological and hydroelectrolytic) with arrhythmic events in the form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsade de Pointes) and recovered cardiorespiratory arrest. Heart failure with reduced LVEF in the context of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with some component of tachycardiomyopathy. Coronary arteries without lesions. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Male, 45 years old. No drug allergies. No arterial hypertension, no diabetes mellitus, no dyslipidaemia. No known heart disease or bronchopathy. Advanced chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis programme, secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Renal transplant in May 2018 with acute rejection on the 10th day with good subsequent response. Proximal deep vein thrombosis at the level of superficial femoral, popliteal vein and deep and twin branches of left lower limb in November 2018 in current treatment with acenocoumarol. Pyelonephritis of the renal graft in March 2019 with good response to antibiotic treatment. Current treatment: prednisone 20 mg/24 hours, tacrolimus 4 mg/24 hours, omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours, enoxaparin 60 mg/24 hours and furosemide 40 mg/24 hours.  Present illness He was admitted from the nephrology department for clinical manifestations of fever, predominantly nocturnal, up to 38.3oC, of 2 weeks of evolution, together with exertional dyspnoea NYHA III, orthopnoea, oedematisation of the lower limbs and cough with whitish expectoration. He had been admitted 2 months previously for the same reason with partial improvement and without identification of the aetiology, but the symptoms recurred after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. No micturition symptoms, no alterations in bowel habits.  On previous admission, a study was performed for a similar clinical picture and fever of unknown origin. Chest CT scan on admission showed mild pericardial effusion and a micronodular interstitial pattern with well-defined nodules, bilaterally and symmetrically distributed. In this context, blood cultures, urine cultures and serology were negative and there was no PCR detection of cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii (in bronchoalveolar lavage) and respiratory viruses. Negative smear microscopy, PCR for tuberculosis in bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchoaspirate and negative mycobacterial culture. Galactomannan for aspergillus in bronchoalveolar lavage negative. Negative PCR for Leishmania in bone marrow. Given the lack of detection of an aetiological agent during admission and the improvement with antibiotic treatment, it was decided to discharge the patient on a course of ciprofloxacin and follow-up in consultations.  Physical examination Good general condition. Eupneic at rest. Blood pressure 136/80 mmHg, heart rate 100 bpm, oxygen saturation 96% (FiO2 0.21).

Left ventricle of normal size, mild parietal hypertrophy, preserved global systolic function (IVS 14mm, Dd 56 mm, Ds 31 mm, LVEF by Teicholtz 76%). Biphasic filling pattern with E/A ratio at 1.5, E/E' at 6.4 (lateral). No valvulopathies. Normal aortic root. Normal right chambers. Right ventricle with good function (TAPSE of 22 mm, lateral S' peak at 18 cm/sec). Minimal TR allowing estimation of normal PSAP. Normal right atrium with area 15 cm2 and volume 33 ml (16 ml/m2).

Severe circumferential pericardial effusion with an M-mode measurement in the parasternal long axis: 19 + 18 mm. Respiratory variation of mitral filling flow less than 25%. Conclusion: severe pericardial effusion, without haemodynamic repercussion by echocardiography. Chest X-ray after pericardiocentesis: normal cardiothoracic index, not suggestive of pericardial effusion. Increased perihilar vascular network, without condensation or occupation of costophrenic sinuses. Pericardial fluid analysis: Cells: erythrocytes 265,200/μl and leukocytes 1,432/μl (10% neutrophils and 90% monocytes).

CLINICAL EVOLUTION During admission, he had a good evolution with no fever peaks and improvement of dyspnoea after diuretic and antibiotic treatment. Blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture and Mantoux were negative. The transthoracic echocardiogram on admission showed preserved biventricular function with severe circumferential pericardial effusion without signs of haemodynamic compromise. As this was a patient with immunosuppressive treatment, fever of unknown origin and these findings in the chest CT scan, tuberculosis was suspected despite Mantoux and negative tests from the previous admission, so treatment was extended for coverage. In addition, it was decided to perform diagnostic pericardiocentesis, previously explaining the risks to the patient due to the presence of liver cysts associated with polycystic kidney disease. It was performed without complications, obtaining 800 ml of serohaematic content and sending the extracted fluid for biochemical and microbiological analysis. Biochemical analysis of the pericardial fluid was compatible with exudate. Cytology showed a very haematic content with abundant mixed lymphocytic and polymorphonuclear inflammatory cellularity. In the microbiological analysis, the culture of the first days was negative, but with positive PCR for tuberculous complex without the presence of mutations in the RPO-B gene associated with resistance to rifampicin. Thus, the diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed despite the other negative tests and the corresponding treatment was completed. The patient remained afebrile and improved in analytical and radiographic controls, so it was decided to discharge him from hospital with his immunosuppressive treatment (tacrolimus and prednisone) and with a specific regimen for tuberculosis with isoniazid + pyridoxine, rifabutin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 2 months and, subsequently, with isoniazid + pyridoxine and rifabutin for 7 more months. On follow-up, pericardial fluid culture was finally found to be positive for mycobacterium, further supporting the diagnosis. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed at 6 months, with the pericardial effusion resolved and no pericardial constriction. The patient has now completed treatment for tuberculosis without complications and is afebrile and clinically well.  DIAGNOSIS Pericardial effusion due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a patient immunocompromised by renal transplantation. Absence of signs of pericardial constriction at follow-up. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Smoker of 3 cigarettes a day. Severe mitral regurgitation secondary to chordal rupture pending surgery. Pre-anaesthetic assessment performed, with last transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TTE) and pre-surgical coronary angiography without epicardial lesions the month prior to the episode. Inguinal hernia surgery. No chronic treatment.  Present illness 50-year-old male brought to hospital emergency department by SAMU after recovered cardiorespiratory arrest. The patient presented at rest while watching television with an episode of loss of consciousness without previous symptoms, at which point his relative called 112 and started basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). On arrival of the SAMU, they observed cardiorespiratory arrest and began advanced CPR manoeuvres (laryngeal mask + mechanical ventilation), observing as the first rhythm ventricular fibrillation (VF), for which 5 shocks were administered, 450 mg of amiodarone and 3 mg of adrenaline, recovering sinus rhythm. On arrival at the emergency department, a laryngeal mask was replaced by an endotracheal tube. The patient was sedoanalgesiated and well adapted to mechanical ventilation, haemodynamically stable without vasopressor or inotropic drugs.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 127/91 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 93 bpm, oxygen saturation 96% (IMV with FIO2 100%). Cardiac auscultation: regular heart sounds, predominant systolic murmur in EIB. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, crackles in the bases. Abdomen: soft and depressible, no pain on palpation. No masses or megaliths. No oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis in the lower limbs. Pulses present, bilateral and symmetrical. Neurological: no sounds, no response to pain, medium photoreactive pupils.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) on arrival at the critical care unit: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, isolated ventricular extrasystoles, PR 160ms. Narrow QRS with normal axis, without repolarisation alterations. ECG during monitoring: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, normal PR, frequent polytopic ventricular extrasystoles, narrow QRS with normal axis, signs of LVH, no significant repolarisation abnormalities. Blood tests on arrival at the critical care unit: haemoglobin 17 g/dl, MCV 96.3 fl. Leukocytes 18100 (Ne 13300, Li 3800). PLT 235,000. D-dimer 11538 μg/ml. IQ 100%. Na+ 137mmEq/l, K 4mmEq/l, Ur 36 mg/dl, creatinine 1.15 mg/dl, calcium 8.8 mg/dl, protein 6.6 g/dl, CRP 0.1 mg/dl, GPT 186 U/l, amylase 173 U/l. Arterial blood gases on arrival (FiO2 50%): pH 7.16, pCO2 58 mmHg, pO2 113 mmHg, HCO3 20.7 mEq/l, Sat O2 98.8%, lactate 5.6 mmol/l. Arterial blood gas one hour after arrival: pH 7.24, pCO2 50 mmHg, pO2 131 mmHg, HCO3 21.4 mEq/l, Sat O2 99.3%, lactate 3 mmol/l. PCR SARS VOC 2 on arrival: negative. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain: size of the ventricular system within the normal range, without significant dilatation of sulci, identifying no intracranial haematic collections, space-occupying lesions, fracture traces or alterations suggesting the presence of areas of acute ischaemia. Midline elements are centred. Pulmonary CT: bibasal condensation due to probable aspiration during orotracheal intubation (OTI). Minimal undisplaced fractures of the 4th and 5th right anterior costal arches. Distended stomach. Chest X-ray: portable study with little inspiration, signs of vascular redistribution without showing infiltrates or pleural effusion. TTE and TEE: mitral valve with eversion of the posterior leaflet at P2 (flail) due to chordal rupture. Two divergent regurgitant jets of globally severe regurgitation (ORE by PISA 0.5 cm2, vena contracta 6-7 mm, regurgitant volume 96 ml). Left ventricle (LV) of greatly increased diameters and volumes with mildly depressed systolic function (LVEF 45-50%). Absence of other significant valvulopathies. Very dilated left atrium. Right ventricle with normal diameters and systolic function preserved in limits. No signs of pulmonary hypertension (PAPS 30-35 mmHg). Inferior vena cava not dilated.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was transferred to the coronary unit (UCO). Cerebral and pulmonary CT was performed to rule out cerebrovascular accident (CVA), pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) or acute aortic syndrome. Given the CT findings, empirical antibiotic therapy was started. A few hours later, he was extubated, with good clinical evolution and remained stable in haemodynamic and respiratory terms. No neurological involvement was identified as a sequelae of the arrest. The control chest X-ray showed disappearance of the alveolar infiltrates. Ten days later, the cardiac surgery team operated to repair the mitral valve, placing a mitral ring and 4 neo-strings. During surgery, extensive prolapse of P2, chordal rupture and cleft between P1-P2 were observed. Postoperative TEE was performed and showed no residual mitral regurgitation (MR) after repair. After the operation, he remained in the OCU, presenting several episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) that led to haemodynamic instability and were controlled by electrical cardioversion (ECV) and intravenous amiodarone perfusion. After reaching stability, a single-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted for secondary prevention. The patient was subsequently discharged. He has continued to undergo check-ups at the clinic, remaining in NYHA functional class I and with no new arrhythmic events.  DIAGNOSIS Malignant mitral valve prolapse (complicated with recovered CRP).

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known drug allergies. Lives with her husband. Never smoker. Occasional drinker. No cardiovascular risk factors or previous cardiological history. Other antecedents: varicose veins in lower limbs. No previous surgical intervention. Chronic treatment: oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel 0.1 mg/etinylestradiol 0.02 mg 1 tablet per day).  Present illness The patient presents with a self-limiting episode of precordial pain at rest. It is attributed to musculoskeletal origin and treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. At 22:15 hours the following day, she presented with a new episode of precordial pain, which did not subside with rest, together with general malaise. Her husband called the emergency services. At that moment, the patient suffered cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) and her husband started basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). On arrival of the emergency services, a shockable rhythm was detected, which changed to sinus rhythm after 3 shocks at 200 joules. Fifteen minutes of advanced CPR were recorded, with orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. The outgoing electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right bundle branch block without clear ST-segment elevation, so the Infarction Code was not activated. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of our centre.  Physical examination On arrival at the ED: temperature 36.7°C, blood pressure 90/73 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 16 rpm, oxygen saturation 94%. Sedoanalgesia, connected to invasive mechanical ventilation. Good distal perfusion. Jugular venous pressure normal. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, tachycardic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Lower extremities without oedema. Carotid, radial and femoral pulses present.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: haemoglobin 12.5 g/dl, MCV 95.9 fl, MCH 30.3 pg C, leukocytes 13,920/μl, platelets 398,000/μl. Biochemistry: glucose 385 mg/dl, urea 27 mg/dl, creatinine 1.25 mg/dl, sodium 139 mmol/l, potassium 2.6 mmol/l, C-reactive protein 0.3 mg/dl. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 165 mg/dl, LDL 94 mg/dl, HDL 33 mg/dl, triglycerides 194 mg/dl, HbA1C 5.4%. TSH 1.22 μIU/ml. Ultrasensitive troponin T (normal < 14 ng/l): serial on admission (on arrival, at 3 hours, at 24 hours, at 36 hours and at discharge): 204 --> 6,032--> 1,954 --> 2,003 --> 1,704 ng/l. Coagulation: INR 0.92. Prothrombin rate 115%. Partial thromboplastin time 28.6 sec. Partial thromboplastin time ratio 0.92. D-dimer 3,349 ng/ml. Arterial blood gas: pH 7.28. pO2 282 mmHg. pCO2 35 mmHg. Bicarbonate 16.9 mmol/l. ECG: post arrest: sinus rhythm, negative T wave in V3-V5. On admission to ICU: sinus rhythm, ST segment elevation from V2 to V4. Angio-CT of pulmonary arteries: no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism or deep vein thrombosis. Cranial CT scan without contrast: no signs of acute intracranial pathology. Echocardiogram in ICU: moderately affected LVEF (39%) with septoapical and apex akinesia, mid-septal and lateroapical hypokinesia. Doubtful image at apical level (two chambers), which could correspond to thrombus. Mild mitral insufficiency. Coronary angiography: right coronary artery without stenosis. Left main coronary artery without stenosis. Anterior descending artery (AD) with spiroid dissection from the proximal portion and occlusion in the middle segment, TIMI 0 flow. Percutaneous coronary intervention to the LAD: intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is implanted. After verifying by IVUS the presence of coronary dissection with guidewire in the true lumen, three drug-eluting stents were implanted from the distal LAD to the ostial LAD with final TIMI 3 flow and without complications. Echocardiogram with contrast: 13 x 8 mm mural thrombus in the apex of the left ventricle (LV).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION A 46-year-old woman was admitted after an out-of-hospital CRA resuscitated by a relative. At the time no infarction code was activated by ECG without clear ST-segment elevation. On arrival at the ED, other possible causes of CRA were ruled out (normal pulmonary CT angiography and cranial CT). Initial emergency echocardioscopy showed no segmental contractility alterations. She was transferred to the ICU, where she was sedated, perfused with low doses of noradrenaline, in sinus rhythm and without respiratory compromise; reactive to verbal stimuli, making coordinated movements with the upper limbs and with reactive pupils. An echocardiogram was performed on admission to the ICU which showed ventricular dysfunction and segmental alterations in contractility in the territory of the LAD artery, so a repeat ECG was performed which showed an elevation of the anterior ST segment. Emergent coronary angiography was performed, showing a spirodial dissection of the proximal LAD with occlusion at the level of the middle LAD and distal TIMI 0 flow, and three drug-eluting stents were implanted with good angiographic results, as well as intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP). In the ICU, she had a favourable evolution that allowed the amine support and IABP to be withdrawn. She was discharged to the hospital ward. She remained in stable condition with amnesia of recent episodes as an identifiable immediate neurological sequela. She remained with a tendency to arterial hypotension and sinus tachycardia during admission without clinical repercussions, which allowed the initiation of neurohormonal treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and beta-blockers. Incidentally, in the initial echocardiogram with moderate LV dysfunction, an image suggestive of apical thrombus was observed, which was later confirmed with contrast echocardiography. Electrocardiographically, the patient progressed to established myocardial necrosis with Q wave from V1 to V3. At discharge, triple antithrombotic therapy was maintained with double antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel and acenocoumarol. Acenocoumarol was withdrawn after 3 months of outpatient follow-up, after resolution of the thrombus.  DIAGNOSIS Out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest in defibrillable rhythm, resuscitated. Ischaemic heart disease, ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEMI), Q-wave infarction secondary to spiroid dissection of the LAD with mid-segment occlusion. Percutaneous treatment with implantation of three drug-eluting overlapping stents from distal LAD to ostial LAD. Moderately affected LVEF in acute phase with mural thrombus in LV apex. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Genetic study: after study of genes related to dilated cardiomyopathy, a variant of uncertain significance c.5009G>A; p.(Arg1670His), in probable heterozygosis, has been observed in the LAMA4 gene. Variants in this gene have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, a pathology with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Echocardiogram at one year follow-up (video 3): Severely dilated and dysfunctional left ventricle, due to very marked general hypokinesia and slight asynchrony; Dd 71 mm (2D), x Simpson calculations: VTD 246 ml, VTS 163 ml, EF 34%. Biphasic left ventricular filling with E/A of 2.5, average E/e' 9.5. Dilated left atrium (34 ml/m2). Normal aortic root. Coil catheter in right chambers, right ventricle (RV) non-functioning with TAPSE of 19 mm and S' at 12 cm/s. Very mild TR allowing estimation of PSAP at 35 mmHg + PVC. Suprahepatic vessels not dilated. No pericardial effusion. Conclusion: DCM with biventricular dysfunction. Severe LV dysfunction with asynchrony unchanged with respect to previous ultrasound.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his evolution, the patient showed improvement in dyspnoea and oedematisation of the lower limbs, maintaining a good diuresis rate after adjustment of treatment. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was requested, showing dilated cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular dysfunction, non-compaction on the lateral side and late anteroseptal subendocardial enhancement, which ruled out myocarditis as the cause. However, in view of the finding of subendocardial late enhancement, angio-CT of the coronary arteries was requested to rule out ischaemic origin of the dysfunction in view of the possibility of a congenital coronary anomaly, but the study was normal. Finally, a genetic study was requested to determine the aetiology, which was positive for DCM with variant of uncertain significance c.5009G>A; p.(Arg1670His) in probable heterozygosis in the LAMA4 gene. During follow-up, the patient showed good evolution without clinical signs of heart failure, but because the ejection fraction did not improve despite medical treatment, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted for primary prevention together with resynchronisation therapy (CRT) due to the presence of a wide QRS of 140 msec and asynchrony. The ICD was implanted without incident, but a resynchronisation lead could not be implanted due to the impossibility of cannulating the coronary sinus. The case was presented to the Heart Team to determine the best therapeutic option for failed CRT implantation, and the decision was made to implant a pacemaker with Hisian pacing. The procedure was performed 6 months after diagnosis, in which the His zone was located with selective capture, but without QRS shortening, so the left branch was located, obtaining a narrower QRS (144 msec) but with R morphology in V1. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic from the cardiac point of view, although with persistent left ventricular dysfunction and asynchrony in the echocardiographic control one year after diagnosis and after implantation of the pacemaker with physiological stimulation in the His bundle. Therefore, this is a clinical case of a patient with diagnosed tuberous sclerosis associated with dilated cardiomyopathy whose aetiology has not been identified since the genetic study shows an inconclusive mutation. The association between both entities is rare.  DIAGNOSIS Dilated cardiomyopathy in a patient with tuberous sclerosis. Hisian physiological pacing pacemaker implantation in a patient with left ventricular dysfunction with asynchrony. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 51-year-old male with the following personal history: No relevant family history of cardiological problems. No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: no arterial hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidaemia. No toxic habits. No previous cardiological history. Baseline situation: sportsman. Asymptomatic when performing physical exertion. No chronic home treatment.  Current illness Consultation at the emergency department due to palpitations of several hours' duration, associated with a feeling of dizziness. According to the patient, he had had palpitations on previous occasions, although they subsided in a self-limited manner with rest. Given the persistence of the symptoms, she decided to go to hospital. She had no other accompanying symptoms (no chest pain or dyspnoea). No history of syncope.  Physical examination On physical examination he was haemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 110/55 mmHg and a heart rate of 217 bpm. Baseline oxygen saturation was 98%. No jugular venous engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, non-painful, no masses or megaliths. Lower extremities: no oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with present and symmetrical pulses. The electrocardiogram showed a regular wide QRS tachycardia at 217 bpm with atrioventricular dissociation and absence of Q wave in aVR, suggestive of ventricular tachycardia. In view of the findings, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for continuous monitoring and surveillance.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: blood count and coagulation within normal range. Renal function and ions within normal parameters. NT-proBNP 1890 pg/ml. Electrocardiogram in tachycardia: regular tachycardia with wide QRS (LC 275 ms) with atrioventricular dissociation and absence of Q in aVR, suggestive of monomorphic VT. Ventricular complex with superior electrical axis, positive in V1 (BRD morphology) and negative in I. Basal electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm. Narrow QRS, with fractionated complexes. Electrical axis of -120o. Negative T waves in inferior face and lateral precordial. Echocardiogram: left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic with mild systolic dysfunction (LVEF 47%). There was akinesia in the basal and middle segments of the inferolateral and lateral face. The right ventricle shows preserved systolic function, with normal structure. Absence of valvulopathies of interest, with normal morphology in the 4 valves. Absence of pericardial effusion. Inferior vena cava not dilated with respiratory phasic changes. Coronary catheterisation: coronary tree with normal distribution and development. Right dominance. Absence of angiographically significant lesions. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): dilated left ventricle with eccentric remodelling and moderate systolic dysfunction. Left ventricular fatty infiltration and segmental contractility abnormalities. Late subepicardial inferior and inferior subepicardial gadolinium enhancement at basal and midventricular levels. Based on the enhancement observed, the findings are suggestive of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and chronic myopericarditis cannot be ruled out.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After admission to the ICU, the patient remained haemodynamically stable despite persistent tachycardia. Echocardiography was performed, showing left ventricular dysfunction and akinesia in the basal and middle segments at the inferolateral and lateral levels. The right ventricle maintained normal structure and preserved systolic function. Treatment with amiodarone (intravenous infusion) was administered to control the ventricular tachycardia, achieving pharmacological cardioversion and recovering sinus rhythm a few hours after starting the infusion. He remained in sinus rhythm for the next 48 hours, asymptomatic, and was transferred to the cardiology hospital ward to complete the aetiological study of the tachycardia. Once on the hospital ward, a regular echocardiography was performed (in sinus rhythm), which confirmed mild systolic dysfunction and segmental disorders of left ventricular contractility. In view of the findings, it was subsequently decided to perform a preferential coronary angiography to rule out coronary ischaemia as the cause of the symptoms, and a coronary tree with a normal distribution and no significant angiographic lesions was observed. The patient remained in hospital for several days, remaining asymptomatic and in sinus rhythm. Finally, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed, showing a striking subepicardial fatty infiltration in the left ventricle and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with subepicardial distribution. These findings are suggestive of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the left ventricle. Subsequent genetic study confirmed the diagnosis, resulting in a pathogenic mutation for ACM in the FLNC gene (filamin C). Once the case was presented and discussed in a clinical session, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of sudden death and to start treatment with beta-blockers. Ablation of the arrhythmic substrate will be assessed in the follow-up in the event of persistent tachycardia or appropriate ICD discharges.  DIAGNOSIS Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the left ventricle in structural phase. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No drug allergies. No cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular history: none. Other: not of interest. Usual treatment: denied. Family history: not of interest. Two healthy children.  Present illness She presented after a fall with rib trauma and fracture of several ribs. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and alteration of the aortic arch, so on-call cardiology was notified. On questioning, the patient reported a previous episode of dizziness on exertion without loss of consciousness. She denied dyspnoea, chest pain, haemoptysis or other associated symptoms. She has two children born vaginally without complications.  Physical examination Heart rate 83 bpm, oxygen saturation 98% at baseline and 95% when walking 300 metres. Cardiac auscultation: systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without added noise. Lower extremities: no oedema. Minimal acropacities.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: haemoglobin 13.8 g/dl, platelets 21 x1000/μl; NT-proBNP 230 pg/ml, troponin T hs: 5.5 ng/l. Rest without relevant findings. Chest X-ray: fracture of the right posterior eighth arch and probable fracture of the seventh and ninth arch associated with right effusion, probable haemothorax given the rib fractures. Cardiomegaly, alteration in the morphology of the superior mediastinum suggesting alteration in the arrangement of the aortic arch. Likewise, given the cardiac morphology, pericardial effusion should be ruled out if there is no history of congenital heart disease. No previous studies are available for comparison. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 70 bpm. Normal PR. Wide QRS left axis. Complete right bundle branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. Anterior left bundle branch hemiblock. Portable transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal size, thickness and function. Severely dilated right ventricle (64 mm basal diameter), hypertrophic, with preserved function. Biauricular dilatation, greater right atrial dilatation. There is a large ostium primum type atrial septal defect with bidirectional flow. Mitral valve with cleft and moderate mitral insufficiency (grade III). Dysplastic tricuspid valve with moderate severe tricuspid regurgitation (grade III). Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 62+5 mmHg. Mild pulmonary insufficiency. Pulmonary acceleration time of 81 msec without mesosystolic notch. Trivalve aortic valve without stenosis or insufficiency. Mild circumferential pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION It was proposed that the patient be admitted to hospital to complete the study (right heart catheterisation and cardiopulmonary exercise test) and to consider starting pulmonary vasodilator treatment, but for personal reasons the patient refused, preferring to opt for outpatient management. Unfortunately, the patient never attends the outpatient appointments and the study is never completed.  DIAGNOSIS Incomplete atrioventricular canal of new diagnosis. Suspicion of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with uncorrected congenital heart disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known drug allergies. Ex-smoker for 15 years. Obesity. Arterial hypertension under pharmacological treatment, with recent modification of treatment. Recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (< 10 months), on treatment with oral antidiabetics. No other medical or surgical history of interest. Family history: father died of lung cancer > 60 years, mother with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) > 60 years. Brother died at 25 years of age of unknown cause. Home treatment: amlodipine 10 mg (0-1-0), olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg (1-0-0), metformin 1000 mg - empagliflozin 5 mg (1-0-1).  Current disease A 45-year-old male patient, with no history of heart disease, attended the emergency department in the early hours of the morning due to deterioration of his functional class with progressive dyspnoea on minimal exertion, associated with episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea in the previous two days, as well as oedematisation of the lower limbs. In addition, he reported an episode of epigastralgia two weeks earlier for which he had been seen in the emergency department and was discharged home with a diagnosis of suspected biliary colic. No infectious symptoms in the previous days or other associated symptoms, afebrile. After initial assessment in the emergency department, the patient was found to be stable although tending towards hypertension, oligosymptomatic and unable to tolerate decubitus, and an electrocardiogram was performed showing sinus tachycardia and electrical alternation. A chest X-ray was requested, showing a large cardiomegaly, with no other relevant pathological findings. Given the suspicion of pericardial effusion, portable echocardiocopy was performed (video 1), confirming the diagnosis of severe circumferential pericardial effusion (> 20 mm), with collapse of the right chambers. Given the initial haemodynamic stability of the patient, it was decided to admit him to cardiology with close monitoring and serum therapy, with a view to performing a fluoroscopy-guided pericardiocentesis first thing the following morning. However, 2 hours later, the patient was again notified due to clinical and haemodynamic deterioration, with arterial hypotension and tachypnoea, so we proceeded to perform emergent pericardiocentesis guided by echocardiography using a subxiphoid approach, achieving drainage of 1,500 ml of haematic pericardial fluid, collecting samples for aetiological diagnosis, with immediate haemodynamic recovery of the patient. After ultrasound verification of the practical resolution of the effusion, continuous drainage is left in the bag and the patient is continuously monitored.  Physical examination Good general condition, conscious, oriented in the three spheres, normal colour and normal depth, no jugular venous engorgement. Hypertension 150/90 mmHg, normocardic, eupneic on room air with no increase in work of breathing, but not tolerating decubitus, maintaining basal oxygen saturation of 98%, afebrile. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: low-pitched rhythmic heart sounds, no murmurs. Bladder murmur was preserved, with no additional pathological sounds. Abdomen globular, soft and depressible, not painful on superficial or deep palpation. Lower extremities with oedema and fovea up to the knees.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: haemoglobin 11 g/dl, MCV 81 fl, MCH 27 pg, leukocytes 13,8000/μl, neutrophils 79%, lymphocytes 11%, platelets 428.000/μl, glucose 221 mg/dl, creatinine 1.56 mg/dl, GFR CKD-EPI 53 ml/min/1.73 m2 , CRP 4.25 mg/dl, procalcitonin 0.21 ng/ml, ultrasensitive troponin I 3.1 pg/ml, CK-MB 1.20 ng/ml, NT-proBNP 231 pg/ml, glycosylated haemoglobin 9%, TSH 1.870 mIU/l. Electrocardiogram: sinus tachycardia at 100 bpm, normal PR, normal axis, narrow QRS, little R progression in precordials, generalised negative T waves, electrical alternans. Chest X-ray: significant cardiomegaly, without alterations of the lung parenchyma. Portable echocardioscopy: left ventricle (LV) with moderate-severe concentric hypertrophy, preserved LV function, severe pericardial effusion > 20 mm circumferential, with swinging heart. Collapsed right chambers. Transthoracic echocardiogram after pericardiocentesis: moderate concentric LV hypertrophy with septal predominance, without LV outflow tract obstruction. LVEF 65%. Moderate pericardial effusion (15 mm) in posterior face in PEEL and 5 mm in anterior face, no respiratory variation of mitral flow, no echographic data of tamponade. No valvulopathies. Analysis of the fluid: haematic aspect, cellularity not assessable due to the presence of clots, glucose 187 mg/dl, protein 5.3 g/dl, pH 7.25, Gram stain with no microorganisms observed, negative bacteriological culture. Samples could not be sent for mycobacteria or cytology. Tumour markers, autoimmunity, serology: CA 125 451 U/ml, rest negative. Autoimmunity negative, non-specific elevation of complement C3 and C4. Serology hepatotropic viruses, CMV, Treponema pallidum and Coxiella burnetii negative. EBV IgG positive. Chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scan: no radiological signs suggestive of neoproliferative process. Severe pericardial effusion and mild left pleural effusion, slightly heterogeneous nodule in the right thyroid lobe (16 mm maximum diameter with fine calcifications inside), left renal angiomyolipoma, enlarged prostate with stigmata of chronic prostatitis. Echocardiogram at discharge: moderate concentric LV hypertrophy. LVEF 68%. Mild pericardial effusion, mostly posterior, 10 mm, minimal in the left ventricle (LV). Visceral pericardial thickening in the apex. No cavity involvement. No valvular heart disease.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his admission to the ward the patient presented very good clinical evolution, with better control of blood pressure after pharmacological adjustment, with sinus tachycardia as the only event recorded on telemetry, asymptomatic from the cardiorespiratory point of view, minimal pericardial friction on auscultation. A regulated transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing moderate concentric LV hypertrophy, preserved left ventricular function and moderate pericardial effusion (15 mm) in the posterior face in PEEL, and 5 mm in the anterior face, with no evidence of tamponade. After more than 30 hours without debit, drainage was removed. Empirical treatment was started with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine, and a referral was made to internal medicine for an overall assessment of the case in order to search for the underlying aetiology, with the initial objective of ruling out paraneoplastic pathology. The characteristics of the pericardial fluid were very unspecific: haematic with abundant clots that did not allow cellularity, proteins and glucose within normal limits and negative bacteriological culture, although it was not possible to send a new valid sample for mycobacterial studies. With regard to the analytical study with determination of tumour markers and autoimmunity, he only presented non-specific elevation of CA 125 and complement fractions C3 and C4. Serology for hepatotropic viruses, HIV, CMV, Treponema pallidum and Coxiella burnetii was negative, IgG positive for EBV. As part of the extension study, a CT scan of the thorax-abdomen-pelvis was performed which ruled out a neoproliferative process, highlighting a nodule in the right lower thyroid lobe and an enlarged prostate with stigmata of chronic prostatitis. Serial echocardiographic controls were performed, presenting progressive reduction of the effusion, leaving only a slight pericardial effusion of 10 mm on the posterior and lateral wall of the LV at discharge. Finally, given the favourable clinical and effusion evolution, and despite the absence of a definitive aetiological diagnosis, it was decided to discharge the patient home and continue close outpatient follow-up and study. After 8 months of follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, with better control of blood pressure and glycaemia, better exercise tolerance, reporting only an episode of self-limited stabbing pain 6 months after the index event, with complete recovery of renal function, reduction of inflammatory markers, as well as CA 125 and glycosylated haemoglobin. Radiological improvement with disappearance of cardiomegaly, leaving minimal residual pericardial effusion of 3-4 mm on the free wall of the RV.
