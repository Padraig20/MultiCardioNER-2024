HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 64-year-old woman with no personal history of interest. No previous cardiological history. She does not take any medication. She came to the emergency department of our hospital with progressive dyspnoea for the last 1 week. She also reported self-limited episodes of palpitations, lasting minutes, which have been occurring daily for the last 6 months. No other symptoms were reported. Physical examination: blood pressure (BP) 120/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 125 bpm, oxygen saturation (SatO2) 95%. Conscious, oriented, eupneic at rest. No jugular venous engorgement. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: arrhythmic, tachycardic, no murmurs. Bybasal crackles. No oedema in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY. ECG. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: cardiothoracic index at the upper limit of normality, signs of vascular redistribution, free costophrenic sinuses. ANALYSIS: normal haemogram. Biochemistry with normal creatinine and ions. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) 2115. E C O C A R D I O G R A M A : moderate left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 35%), mild right ventricular dysfunction. Mild left atrial dilatation. Mild mitral and tricuspid insufficiency. Normal pulmonary artery pressure. Compatible with tachycardiomyopathy. Study performed in sinus rhythm.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the presence of a narrow QRS tachycardia with a regularly irregular pattern, it was decided to perform vagal manoeuvres, observing the cessation of the tachycardia with early recurrence as seen in the ECG. Looking closely at the ECG, one can see what looks like a p-wave for every two QRS with a constant interval, also, in one of the ECGs one can see a beat with an image of complete right bundle branch right bundle branch block (RBBB). This could correspond to an anterograde dual nodal pathway tachycardia, as confirmed by the electrophysiological study performed during admission. At the same time, as the patient was in heart failure, depletive treatment was started with a good response. The echocardiogram showed a non-dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction and global hypokinesia. Treatment was therefore started for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, beginning with enalapril 2.5 mg (twice a day), bisoprolol 2.5 mg (1 tablet at breakfast) and eplerenone 25 mg (1 tablet at breakfast). During admission, a coronary computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which ruled out significant lesions in the coronary arteries. It was decided to proceed with ablation of non-reentrant intranodal tachycardia, with success, and she was discharged a few days later. After 4 months, a control echocardiogram was performed with normalisation of ventricular function, and the patient was asymptomatic.  DIAGNOSIS Double nodal anterograde tachycardia. Probable tachycardiomyopathy in relation to previous findings. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
38-year-old male in NYHA functional class II/IV.  History, current illness and physical examination History: Stage V chronic renal failure (CRF) due to left renal dysplasia and renal cysts, on haemodialysis for two years. Hyperparathyroidism secondary to CKD, renoureteral carcinoma operated on eight years ago. Hepatic cholestasis, stenosis of main pulmonary arteries, arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, active smoking. Daughter underwent liver transplant at the age of seven. Admitted a year ago for an episode of acute pulmonary oedema triggered by volume overload.  Clinical history: In the haemodialysis session she began with intense dizziness, sweating and dyspnoea; the previous day she had already reported paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Physical examination revealed poor general condition with a BP of 75/48, cardiac and pulmonary auscultation revealed the presence of a 4/6 systolic murmur in the aortic focus radiating to the left sternal border and carotid arteries with abolished 2nd sound and crackles up to midfield. An ECG was performed which showed ST-segment elevation in the lower lateral face and ST-segment elevation from V2 to V3. Blood tests showed Hb of 7.0 g/dl. Serum therapy was started, with transfusion of two red blood cell concentrates, which corrected the electrocardiographic alterations; after fluid replacement, acute pulmonary oedema began and the patient was admitted to the ICU.  Complementary tests - Electrocardiogram: Sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, Axis 80o, LVH criteria, negative T waves in III, poor growth of r from V1 to V3, PR of 200 ms, asymmetric negative T waves in III and V5-V6. - CBC: Glucose 106, urea 38, Cr 3.1. K 3.2, Na 138, Hb 9.6. MCV 89, CPK 47, CK-MB 2.7, TpI 0.22. - Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index 0.55, with parahilar alveolar infiltrates. - Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV with moderate concentric hypertrophy with normal LVEF. Calcium in the mitral annulus. Bicuspid aortic valve with severe stenosis: peak gradient 76 mmHg and mean 46-50 mmHg, area per continuity of 0.56 cm2/m2 and mild insufficiency. Normal right chambers with normofunctioning RV. Normal pulmonary valve with somewhat thinned main branches. - Cardiac MRI: Proximal stenosis of both main branches of the pulmonary artery, right pulmonary artery with a calibre of 9x8 mm proximally and 11x13 mm distally and left pulmonary artery with a calibre of 9x10 mm proximally and 8x7 mm distally. Right ventricle not dilated, systolic function preserved. RVEF: 61.9%; RVOT: 136.4 ml; STV: 52 ml (performed one year prior to admission). - Coronary angiography: Coronary arteries angiographically without lesions. Severe aortic stenosis. - Chest CT angiography: Proximal stenosis of both pulmonary arteries: right pulmonary artery diameter 9 mm and left pulmonary artery diameter 10 mm, cardiomegaly at the expense of the left cavities (performed during admission).  Clinical evolution The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with acute pulmonary oedema, which improved after non-invasive mechanical ventilation and haemofiltration. An emergency transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed severe aortic stenosis in a calcified bicuspid aortic valve with reduced mobility. During admission, a chest CT angiography was performed to assess pulmonary artery stenosis, which had no severity criteria. Once the patient was stabilised, coronary angiography was performed (described above) with a view to replacing the aortic valve. Finally, the patient underwent surgery with implantation of a Magna Ease size 23 biological aortic prosthesis, the postoperative period passed without complications. The echocardiogram prior to discharge showed that the prosthesis was functioning normally.

Below the coronary sinus and at subvalvular level there is a yet of 5 mm towards the right atrium. The mitral valve is morphologically normal. The rest is normal.  Clinical evolution It was decided to admit the patient to hospital. During his stay, the patient remained haemodynamically stable. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started, being replaced by ampicillin and gentamicin after antibiogram. Extracorporeal surgery was performed with deep hypothermia and intermittent blood cardioplegia for adequate myocardial protection, with cannulation of both cavas and ascending aorta. Femoral arteries and veins are cannulated and median resternotomy and release of cardiac adhesions are performed. Clamping of the ascending aorta was performed, with opening of the ascending aorta and right atriotomy, with visualisation of two perivalvular abscesses, one in the mitroaortic junction without fistula to the LA of 2-3 cm in diameter and another abscess at the level of the non-coronary sinus with fistulisation to the RA. The aortic prosthesis was explanted and the left cavity drained through the fossa ovalis and both abscesses were closed with a bovine pericardial patch sutured in a circular fashion and a Sant Jude Regent aortic prosthesis number 25 was implanted, with 15 U-shaped stitches and aortic root lavage. The aortomy and atriotomy were closed with double sutures and the perforation to AD from the right side with stitches supported by pericardium. All this, with adequate haemostatic controls afterwards. With ischaemia time of 125 minutes and surgical time of 143 minutes. At the end of the surgery, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, with no evidence of flow inside the abscesses. During follow-up, the patient has improved functional class and ventricular volumes with LVEDD of 55 mm, with a slightly depressed LVEF of approximately 45%. Septal akinesia. Moderately dilated LA. Bidisc prosthesis with normal motion, with gradients in the range of normofunction. Aortic insufficiency with two intraprosthetic mild-grade jets.

A 77-year-old man with no drug allergies, hypertension as the only cardiovascular risk factor, on treatment with lisinopril. Other antecedents included nephritic colic, biliary lithiasis and prostatitis. Previously asymptomatic, the patient consulted the emergency department for diaphoresis and dysthermic sensation of 24 h of evolution, associated with alimentary vomiting, without thermometric fever or abdominal pain. He was asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view. On arrival, temperature 37.8oC, blood pressure 98/56 mmHg, HR 112 bpm and SatO2 94% on room air. Glasgow 14 with a tendency to somnolence. Skin pallor with lividity as a sign of poor peripheral perfusion. Rhythmic heart tones, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur, without rales. The abdomen at this time is depressible, with generalised pain on palpation, without clear signs of peritoneal irritation. No oedema in the lower extremities. Suspicion of acute abdomen led to a blood test showing acute renal failure with creatinine 3.45 mg/dl and GFR 18 ml/min, metabolic acidosis (pH 7.3, lactate 5 mmol/l) and increased acute phase reactants (CRP > 170 mg/l, procalcitonin > 100 ng/ml, leukocytosis of 14,000/μl). While in the emergency department awaiting further tests, he presented sudden dyspnoea with significant respiratory work and a slight decrease in the level of consciousness (somnolence), pulmonary auscultation compatible with acute pulmonary oedema and electrocardiogram in sinus tachycardia with necrosis and current from an inferoposterior subepicardial lesion. At this point, oxygen therapy was started and the cardiology department was consulted. Bicarbonate perfusion and non-invasive mechanical ventilation were started with improvement of the poor perfusion data and a bedside echocardiogram was performed which showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction due to global hypocontractility with inferior hypokinesia, without pericardial effusion. Given the suspicion of Killip IV inferoposterior STEMI, double platelet antiplatelet therapy was administered and emergent coronary angiography was performed, showing 2-vessel disease with occlusion of the right coronary artery at distal level, on which PCI was performed with implantation of a drug-eluting stent. During the procedure, he presented progressive haemodynamic deterioration, so intravenous perfusion of dobutamine was started. Despite this, the patient continued to deteriorate with frank hypotension and tachycardia, and it was decided to add noradrenaline and implant an intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation device. After this, he was admitted to the cardiac critical care unit.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS  In the emergency department:  Blood tests: Glucose 214 mg/dl, urea 84 mg/dl, creatinine 3.45 mg/dl, bilirubin 1.35 mg/dl, GOT 113 U/l, GPT 45 U/l, Na 135.6 mEq/l, K 5'17 mEq/l, Cl 99 mEq/l, CRP 178 mg/l, procalcitonin > 100 mg/l. Haemogram: leucocytes 14,590/μl (77% neutrophils), haemoglobin 18.8 g/dl, haematocrit 55.2%, platelets 311,000/μl. INR 1.19. DD 3,443 ng/ml. Markers of myocardial necrosis: troponin I US 11,955 pg/ml (normal < 25 pg/ml), CK 1,265 U/l. Blood gases: pH 7.01, bicarbonate 17.4 mmol/l, lactate 15.5 mmol/l.  Chest X-ray, paucisymptomatic: cardiac silhouette of normal size, free costophrenic sinuses. Normal lung parenchyma. ECG: sinus tachycardia at 138 bpm. Normal PR. Narrow QRS. QR pattern in DII, DIII and aVF with ST segment elevation of 4-5 mm. ST-segment depression of 1 mm in DI, 2 mm in aVL due to reciprocal changes. Flat ST-segment depression up to 4 mm in V1-V3. Echocardioscopy: LV systolic function at least moderately depressed by global hypocontractility and severe inferior hypokinesia. Absence of pericardial effusion.  Emergent coronary angiography: 2-vessel coronary artery disease: Anterior descending: with diffuse atheromatosis, ectatic area at mid level with 40% stenosis, in distal LAD 70% lesion. Right coronary: ectatic vessel with occlusion in the middle segment. Percutaneous coronary intervention with implantation of 1 drug-eluting stent. In the cardiology critical care unit: Abdominal X-ray: levels suggestive of upper intestinal obstruction in the left hypochondrium. Chest X-ray: increased perihilar density with bilateral vascular redistribution. Abdominal CT scan: findings compatible with obstructive intestinal ileus of biliary origin.  Microbiology: Urinary sediment: erythrocytes 51-80/field, leukocytes 3-5/field. Blood cultures: Bacteroides vulgatus. Urine culture: negative. Tracheal aspirate: negative.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On admission to the critical cardiology unit, haemodynamic instability persisted under perfusion with noradrenaline, dobutamine and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. Due to progressive respiratory worsening, orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were decided. Swan-Ganz catheter was implanted and the following parameters were obtained, compatible with distributive shock: mean arterial pressure 70 mmHg, HR 125 bpm, central venous pressure 6 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure 32/18 mmHg, pulmonary capillary pressure 12 mmHg, cardiac output 6.8 l/min, cardiac index 3.47 l/min/m, systemic vascular resistances 752 dyn/s/cm . Following these findings, intensive fluid therapy is started, noradrenaline dose is increased and dobutamine dose is reduced. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation support was decreased to 1:2 and withdrawn after a few hours along with dobutamine. In view of the suspicion of intestinal occlusive symptoms, a nasogastric tube was placed with a 1-litre fecal contents debit. Good haemodynamic evolution with adjustment of vasoactive treatment guided by information from the Swan-Ganz catheter, with a control echocardiography showing preserved ventricular function. A thoracoabdominal CT scan was performed showing findings compatible with obstructive intestinal ileus of biliary origin. A multidisciplinary team (cardiology, surgery, anaesthesia and intensive care unit) agreed on the indication for surgery and decided to delay it until haemodynamic stabilisation. Fever persisted at the infectious level. Blood cultures were taken and empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam was prescribed. Microbiological screening showed Bacteroides vulgatus in blood cultures, compatible with sepsis of abdominal origin. Finally, after 48 hours, supra-infraumbilical laparotomy was performed, opting to maintain the double antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel during the operation due to the high thrombotic risk following the recent stent implantation in an ectatic vessel that had an abundant amount of thrombotic material. During surgery, seropurulent free fluid and biliary ileus were found, resulting in a punctate perforation of the jejuno-ileum, and resection and anastomosis were performed. After surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, with a slow but correct evolution, and was finally discharged home after 15 days of hospitalisation. The echocardiogram at discharge showed mild LV systolic dysfunction due to inferior hypokinesia (LVEF 49%). Treatment at discharge consisted of double antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24 h and clopidogrel 75 mg/24 h, neurohormonal treatment with bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 h and ramipril 2.5 mg/24 h and treatment with a high-potency statin atorvastatin 80 mg/24 h.

Chemotherapy treatment of myeloma with: CyBorDex (cyclophosphamide + bortezomib + dexamethasone).  Current disease A 63-year-old male patient with the aforementioned history, who while admitted to the haematology department for febrile syndrome, under active treatment for multiple myeloma, presented with a condition characterised by palpitations. When vital signs were taken, an arrhythmic and rapid pulse curve was observed, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) was requested, confirming the suspected diagnosis. In view of the ECG findings, a cardiology assessment was requested. She denied current or previous chest pain.  Physical examination Conscious and oriented in person, time and place. Collaborative, eupneic at rest and afebrile. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic heart sounds, tachycardic, systolic murmur II/VI in mitral focus not radiating. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without added sounds. Abdomen: soft and depressible. No pain on superficial or deep palpation, no visceromegaly. Preserved hydro-aerial sounds.

Serial myocardial damage markers during admission (48 hours): creatine kinase: 61--> 49 U/l. Ultrasensitive troponin T: 24--> 26 ng/l. Coagulation: T. prothrombin 13.00 sec. T. partial thromboplastin (R. 0.98 T. prothrombin (%) 82.0%. Derived fibrinogen 477. Prothrombin T. (ratio 1.14). INR 1.14 T. partial thromboplastin 30.90 sec. ECG: AF at 150 L/min, narrow QRS, low voltages in limb leads, abnormal R wave progression in precordial leads, normal axis, inverted T waves in high lateral face. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, no pinched costophrenic angles or increased vascular pattern. Transthoracic echocardiogram: normal sized left ventricle with mild hypertrophy (interventricular septum thickness 14mm), mild global hypokinesia resulting in an LVEF 40%. Right ventricle (RV) slightly dilated with mild hypokinesia of the free wall, moderate low functional mitral insufficiency and moderate tricuspid insufficiency with estimated PSAP of 33mmHg + PVC.  Previous complementary tests of interest: pyrophosphate scintigraphy (Tc99m-DPD) (image 2): a pathological deposit of radiotracer was observed, with biventricular distribution and intensity greater than that of the adjacent bone (grade 3), compatible with cardiac amyloidosis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION A 63-year-old male patient was admitted to the haematology department for febrile syndrome, being at the time of admission under active treatment for multiple myeloma with multiple organ involvement and presenting with an episode of atrial fibrillation. The patient commented that the symptoms had started suddenly 2 hours prior to our assessment. An ECG was performed showing AF with a previously unknown rapid ventricular response. Given that the patient clearly noticed the onset of symptoms and that vital parameters had been within normal limits in the previous 24 hours (heart rate around 60-80 per minute), it was decided to manage the patient with rhythm control. After bolus and infusion amiodarone, the patient recovered sinus rhythm about 5 hours later. Treatment with oral amiodarone and beta-blockers was discontinued. An echocardiogram was performed (already in SR) showing a slightly hypertrophic left ventricle with normal size and function, with left atrial enlargement, normal right chambers, low moderate mitral regurgitation and minimally elevated PSAP. The patient progressed satisfactorily and did not develop signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. The management of anticoagulation with this patient, having a CHADS2-VA2SC of 1 (CHF) was a challenge, as the patient is not adequately represented in current clinical practice guidelines. Being a patient with this score on the CHADS2-VA2SC scale and having AL cardiac amyloidosis as comorbidity, it was decided, in consensus with the haematology service, to initiate anticoagulation treatment with rivaroxaban, as he was a patient at high thromboembolic risk.  DIAGNOSIS AL cardiac amyloidosis. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, pharmacological cardioversion. CHADS2-VA2SC 1 point. Moderately impaired LVEF. Moderate low mitral insufficiency. Multiple myeloma with cardiac and renal involvement in active treatment. Febrile syndrome in patient with mild bicytopenia. Chronic renal disease secondary to monoclonal gammopathy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  We present the case of a 58-year-old man with a history of smoking cessation, arterial hypertension, chronic bronchopathy, microcrystalline arthropathy, atrial fibrillation, mitral annuloplasty two years earlier for severe valvular insufficiency and last admission for decompensation of heart failure a few months earlier due to consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anaemia. Last transthoracic echocardiogram the previous year: non-dilated left ventricle, with slight hypertrophy and preserved ejection fraction. Mitral annulopasty with residual insufficiency III-IV/IV. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Bicuspid aortic valve. On the other hand, at the end of last year a low anterior intestinal resection was performed for a colon carcinoma in the rectum-sigmoid junction, diagnosed as a result of an anaemia study. Previous treatments: dabigatran 150 mg 1-0-1; allopurinol 300 mg 1-0-1; furosemide 40 mg 1-0-0; omeprazole 20 mg 1-0-0, tiotropium bromide 18 mcg 1-0-0; budesonide 200 mcg 1-0-1; ferrous sulphate 1-0-0; alendronic acid 70 mg 1 every 7 days; calcium carbonate 500 mg/400 IU 1-0-0. The patient is currently attending the emergency department for a 2-month history of dyspnoea, predominantly nocturnal with 2-pillow orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, progressive deterioration of functional class and cough without expectoration. In addition, the previous 4 days he started a febrile condition with temperatures up to 38.2 oC. In the ED he presented with acceptable general condition and mild tachypnoea, maintaining baseline oxygen saturations of 98%. Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed a systolic murmur in mitral focus and bibasal crackles. No other findings of interest.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: Biochemistry: glucose 162.5 mg/dl.

Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 86 beats, left axis, widened QRS with image compatible with complete left bundle branch block, without other relevant findings. Similar to previous ones. Chest X-ray: evidence of heart failure without clear consolidations. Nasopharyngeal exudate (x2): negative for SARS-CoV-2. Blood cultures (2 sets): isolation of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, sensitive to linezolid, glycopeptides, daptomycin and synergy with gentamicin. Transthoracic echocardiogram: biventricular dilatation. Mitral and aortic insufficiency at least moderate. Transesophageal echocardiogram: bicuspid aortic valve with infiltration and destructuring of the entire fused leaflet that prolapses and causes severe insufficiency, with probable perforation of the leaflet. Thickening of the posterior wall of the aorta, surrounding the left coronary artery, which cannot be ruled out as abscessation at that level. Holodiastolic inversion pattern in descending thoracic aorta. Mitral annuloplasty with a 12 mm filiform and mobile image suggestive of vegetation, leading to severe valvular insufficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain: no intracranial complications of interest were observed.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Initially, under the diagnosis of heart failure probably related to anaemia, the patient was transfused with red blood cell concentrate and depletive treatment was started, with substantial clinical improvement. However, although the patient's dyspnoea and non-productive cough could be attributed to his decompensation of heart failure, given the current epidemiological context, especially with the febrile peak, it was imperative to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the patient was transferred to the COVID-19 hospital and treatment with hydroxychloroquine was initiated. Two negative nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained, which, together with the positivity in the two sets of blood cultures for E. faecium, made it possible to reasonably rule out the diagnosis of coronavirus infection and direct the focus towards a diagnosis of heart failure in the context of infective endocarditis and exacerbation of chronic anaemia. He was therefore transferred from the internal medicine ward of COVID-19 to the cardiology ward, starting empirical antibiotherapy with daptomycin at the time of positive blood cultures. Once the antibiogram was known, it was decided to extend coverage by adding ampicillin and gentamicin. The case was presented to the cardiac surgery department, who accepted the patient for intervention. A brain MRI was performed which ruled out significant neurological complications. However, it was decided to take another exudate for SARS-CoV-2 PCR as a precautionary measure, and the result was positive. The patient was therefore transferred back to the COVID-19 internal medicine hospital for medical treatment until the nasopharyngeal exudate was negative, with the option of urgent surgery in the event of worsening resistant to medical treatment. The patient remained for several days with persistent fever and progressive clinical deterioration, with dyspnoea on minimal effort, intense orthopnoea that forced him to sleep sitting up and several episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, requiring oxygen therapy with a reservoir, so that finally, taking into account the risk/benefit balance, it was decided to intervene, performing a double valve replacement with mechanical prostheses. After surgery, the patient was transferred to intensive care, where he experienced a torpid initial evolution, developing mixed cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock in relation to extracorporeal circulation, requiring orotracheal intubation and support with dobutamine and noradrenaline. Echocardioscopy showed volume depletion and moderate deterioration of left ventricular contractility, with a favourable response to levosimendan. He also developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was adequately controlled with digoxin. Finally, in the following days he evolved satisfactorily, and vasoactive support was discontinued and extubation was performed, although he intermittently required non-invasive mechanical ventilation.  DIAGNOSIS Decompensation of predominantly left-sided heart failure secondary to anaemia and infective aortic and mitral endocarditis due to E. faecium with severe failure of both valves. Exacerbation of chronic microcytic hypochromic anaemia, requiring 1 red blood cell concentrate. Mild respiratory infection due to SARS-CoV-2. Mixed cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock in relation to extracorporeal circulation, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and vasoactive support. De novo atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, controlled with digoxin. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION This clinical case presents a patient with chronic coronary syndrome since 2012 and double aortic lesion with predominant moderate-severe stenosis since 2015, asymptomatic after starting antianginal treatment and implantation of a drug-eluting stent for any cardiovascular symptoms until March 2019. In that year, the patient developed dyspnoea on exertion and the echocardiogram was updated to show a double aortic lesion with predominantly severe stenosis and a critical valve area. Given that the patient had severe symptomatic aortic valve disease, it was decided to act on it. The risks of surgery were calculated, with a EuroScore II of 1.97% and EuroScore I of 5.30%, and the case was discussed by the heart team. Despite having a SCORE of low surgical risk according to the scales used, given that the patient was morbidly obese with marked limitation of ambulation, and that these scales do not include factors such as significant obesity with the high surgical risk that this entails, aortic valve replacement surgery was rejected and TAVI was chosen. A pre-TAVI CT scan was performed which demonstrated the possibility of performing the technique. On the other hand, the patient was referred for endocrinology consultations to manage her diabetes and to try to reduce her weight prior to valve replacement. She was initially seen in June 2019 and several measures were initiated: 1800 kcal diet, increase of metformin dose to 850 mg 1 tablet breakfast, lunch and dinner and initiation of semaglutide to better control her diabetes and attempt weight reduction, initially at a dose of 0.25 mg weekly for the first month and then 0.5 mg weekly from the following month. She was not started on iSGLT-2 due to repeated urinary tract infections. She progressively lost weight and was seen in pre-anaesthesia consultation in June 2019, with surgical risk ASA-III and included in the surgical list. In October 2019, the operation was performed under general anaesthesia with orotracheal intubation and transesophageal echocardiography. Prior to the procedure, the right jugular vein was cannulated with transient intravenous pacemaker implantation. The left femoral artery was punctured by Doppler ultrasound. The right femoral artery was guided with contralateral angiography, through which a 26th Edwards SAPIEN prosthesis was advanced. During prosthesis implantation the patient developed complete left bundle branch block without atrioventricular block. There was minimal aortic regurgitation by TEE and none by aortography. The right femoral access was closed with Prostar, and the absence of complications was verified by contralateral angiography, and the left femoral access was closed with AngioSeal. The patient was extubated in the ward and transferred in good clinical and haemodynamic condition to the coronary unit. Total procedure time 60 minutes. During her stay in the coronary unit, the patient remained haemodynamically stable, tending to arterial hypertension, requiring intravenous nitroglycerin during the first hours, which could be suspended later after reintroduction of the usual oral antihypertensive treatment. In sinus rhythm with good heart rate on telemetry, with disappearance of left bundle branch block over the hours and no atrioventricular block of any kind. Respiratory stability, initially with Sa02 < 90% in the context also of the extrapulmonary restrictive disorder due to obesity associated with some pulmonary congestion, which after occasional administration of IV furosemide improved to Sa02 > 94% on room air. Normal renal function with preserved diuresis. Afebrile with low infection parameters. E. coli was isolated in urine > 100,000 CFU/ml covered with antibiotic prophylaxis administered pre-TAVI (curoxime). No complications were observed at the femoral access points, with no haematomas or murmurs, bilateral pedal pulses present and stable haemoglobin in the control tests. Treatment was started with double antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel) and she was transferred to the hospital ward after a 24-hour stay in the coronary unit. She remained on the hospital ward for 4 more days with progressive ambulation and no local or systemic complications, and was discharged home. The patient is currently being followed in the valvulopathy clinic with complete disappearance of dyspnoea and angina. She is following the diet proposed by endocrinology and oral antidiabetic treatment consisting of semaglutide and metformin, with a last recorded weight of 106 kg, with a weight loss of 21.5 kg and improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin to 5.5%.  DIAGNOSIS Implantation of TAVI Edwards SAPIEN 3 no 26 for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Chronic coronary syndrome with implantation of a drug-eluting stent in 2012. Preserved LVEF.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Brother and nephew diagnosed with HCM. No history of sudden death in first-degree relatives. No known drug allergies. Worked in newspaper distribution. Smoker of 30 cigarettes per day, with a cumulative rate of 48 packs per year. Cardiovascular risk factors: obesity grade I (body mass index [BMI] 32 kg/m2). No hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidaemia. Follow-up in cardiology consultations for asymmetric obstructive HCM with inconclusive genetic study. At diagnosis, there was no significant obstruction. However, during subsequent follow-up and coinciding with a clear worsening of her functional class, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a progressive increase in septal hypertrophy causing an obstructive dynamic gradient and systolic anterior motion (SAM) in the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, leading to moderate mitral regurgitation. Cardiogenic syncope in 2019, for which it was decided to implant a DDDR implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in primary prevention, given that the risk of sudden death at 5 years was 7.1%. In successive check-ups, close monitoring was carried out to control symptoms and drug titration, despite which dyspnoea and angina on exertion persisted. Baseline: independent for basic activities of daily living. Higher functions preserved. Active life. Currently presents dyspnoea on usual exertion, in NYHA functional class III. Usual treatment: omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours, disopriramide 100 mg/ 8 hours, verapamil 120 mg/12 hours.  Present illness A 52-year-old patient returned to the emergency department of our hospital due to chest pain and an increase in his baseline dyspnoea to the point of minimal effort. He did not present orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea crises, decreased diuresis or oedema in the lower limbs. On arrival at the ED, the patient was haemodynamically stable, with slight tachypnoea at rest, maintaining oxygen saturation 98%. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, with no changes with respect to those previously described, as well as serum markers of myocardial damage, which were normal. Admission to cardiology was decided.  Physical examination Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. Normal colour, well hydrated and perfused. Afebrile. Haemodynamically stable (blood pressure [BP] 127/84 mmHg, heart rate [HR] 70 bpm). Eupneic at rest. Oxygen saturation 99% without oxygen therapy. Cardiorespiratory auscultation: rhythmic tones at a good frequency, with a panfocal systolic murmur that increases with the Valsalva manoeuvre. Good ventilation in both lung fields with no added pathological noises. Abdomen soft and depressible. No masses or megaliths palpable. Not painful. No signs of peritoneal irritation or peritonism. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. Pedial pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: Biochemistry: glucose 106 mg/dl, urea 35 mg/dl, Cr 0.92 mg/dl, uric acid 6 mg/dl, GFR > 90 ml/min. Ionogram normal. Abdominal profile: total bilirubin 2.31 mg/dl, at the expense of indirect (1.69 mg/dl), rest normal. Total protein 6.9 g/dl. NT-proBNP 869 pg/ml. Serial myocardial damage markers: normal. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 206 mg/dl, LDL 140 mg/dl, HDL 42 mg/dl, triglycerides 122 mg/dl. PSA 0.16 ng/ml. HbA1c 5.6%. CBC: haemoglobin 14.4 g/dl, platelets 181x109/l, leucocytes 1073 x109/l with normal formula. Electrocardiograms (ECG): emergency ECG: pacemaker stimulation at 60 bpm, evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. QTc 440 ms. ECG on the ward: in sinus rhythm 71 bpm. Normal PR. Positive Sokolow's criteria with overload data and negative T waves from V4 to V6, I and aVL. TTE: severe and asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy with maximum myocardial thickness at septal level (26-27 mm) with clear SAM leading to moderate mitral regurgitation. Obstructive dynamic gradient at LVOT level with a gradient of 50 mmHg, which with Valsalva manoeuvres reaches 82 mmHg. Preserved left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 70%. Low echocardiographic probability of pulmonary hypertension. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) (videos 3 and 4): mitral valve with no structural alterations of note. No elongation of leaflets or subvalvular apparatus. Slight thickening of the anterior leaflet at the level of its A2 scallop. It presents an alteration of the dynamics consisting of retraction of both leaflets in closure by intraventricular dynamic gradient mechanism at the level of the left LVOT with SAM of both the anterior and posterior leaflets. This alteration of the dynamics generates a mitral insufficiency jet of at least moderate size. No other alterations were observed beyond those found in the HCM mechanism secondary to SAM with involvement of the entire valve apparatus. Coronary angiography: angiographically normal coronary arteries. The second septal branch (of greater calibre and development) is selectively cannulated, as the first branch also fistulises the left ventricle in the angiographic image. After selective occlusion of this branch and injection of ultrasound contrast, TTE shows correct basal opacification of the septum, but with almost complete drainage of the contrast to the left ventricle. Cardiac MRI: non-dilated left ventricle, with concentric increase of its mass and severe asymmetric hypertrophy of septal predominance. Maximum myocardial thickness in the basal anteroseptal (26 mm) and mid inferoseptal (24 mm) segments. Thicknesses in apical septal 16 mm, basal inferoseptal 16 mm and mid-anteroseptal 15 mm. Rest of segments with maximum thicknesses of 13 mm. Normal segmental contractility and end-systolic collapse of the ventricular cavity leading to hyperdynamic systolic function. At LVOT level, there is systolic flow acceleration and SAM of the anterior mitral leaflet leading to mitral insufficiency conjet directed to the lateral wall of the left atrium. An intramyocardial crypt is seen in the mid segment of the inferior aspect. The ejection fraction measured with the Simpson method was 81%. LVEDV of 144 ml, indexed by body surface area of 72 ml/m, LVESV of 27 ml, indexed by body surface area of 13.5 ml/m Cardiac output of 6.8 l/min. Myocardial mass 285 g, indexed by body surface area of 142 .g/m Right ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic, with preserved global and segmental mobility. Ejection fraction measured by Simpson's method of 81 % RVEDV of 104 ml, indexed by body surface area of 52 ml/m. VTSVD of 19 ml, indexed by body surface area of 9.5 ml/m . Dilated left atrium with an area of 41 cm, indexed by 20 cm/m . Normal right atrium (21 cm, indexed 10.5 cm/m). The first-pass perfusion sequence shows no baseline perfusion defects. Late enhancement/viability sequence shows no fibrosis or necrosis. Conclusion: Asymmetric obstructive HCM without fibrosis. Non-dilated left ventricle with preserved systolic function.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Patient diagnosed with asymmetric HCM in 2009 after consulting for palpitations, without correlating at that time with tachyarrhythmias. At the time of diagnosis, there was no significant LVOT obstruction. Since then, he has been followed up in cardiology outpatient clinics and was found to be asymptomatic after initiation of low-dose beta-blockers. Subsequent check-ups revealed a worsening of his functional class to the point of dyspnoea and angina on minimal exertion. Beta-blockers were titrated to maximum doses on an outpatient basis and, taking advantage of the fact that the patient was a DDDR ICD user, the parameters of the latter were optimised to achieve left ventricular pacing greater than 90%. Despite this, the patient continued to be symptomatic and with a significant obstructive gradient of more than 50 mmHg. It was decided to start treatment with high doses of calcium antagonists associated with disopyramide and to titrate doses, and the possibility of septal ablation with alcohol or Morrow surgery was considered if there was no adequate clinical response. However, the patient was finally admitted to our care due to worsening symptoms. During admission, it was decided to initiate the preliminary study to assess whether he was a candidate for septal ablation with alcohol or surgical myomectomy while continuing with the titration of medical treatment without being able to reach higher doses due to the presence of anticholinergic symptoms associated with disopyramide. Finally, given the degree of ventricular hypertrophy and the absence of a septal branch suitable for alcohol septal ablation, surgical myomectomy was chosen.  DIAGNOSIS Septal HCM with severe LVOT obstruction. Moderate mitral regurgitation due to SAM. Exertional angina and dyspnoea in NYHA functional class III secondary to the above. DDDR ICD carrier in primary prevention (risk of sudden death at 5 years according to the European Society of Cardiology score: 7.1%). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY Cardiovascular risk factors: dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus. Previous cardiological history: Chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. Debut in June 2018 as evolved anterior myocardial infarction, in Killip-Kimbal II haemodynamic situation. Two-vessel coronary artery disease completely revascularised percutaneously by implantation of two drug-eluting stents at the level of mid-first diagonal anterior descending (primary angioplasty) and posterior interventricular (second time). Severe left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 30% at discharge). Admission in August 2018 for symptoms compatible with Dressler syndrome. Favourable evolution with the combination of high-dose salicylates and colchicine. Subsequent follow-up in the heart failure clinic, where the medication has been titrated with prognostic impact. Start of sacubitril/valsartan in November 2018 due to persistence of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II Association (NYHA) functional class II. Ergometry at the end of the cardiac rehabilitation programme clinically and electrically negative for ischaemia, in functional class I (12.67 METS). No other comorbidities of interest. Current treatment: omeprazole 20 mg/day, acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day, prasugrel 10 mg/day, sacubitril/valsartan 49/51 mg/12 hours, bisoprolol 5 mg/day, eplerenone 50 mg/day, metformin/empaglifozin 1000 mg/5 mg every 12 hours, rosuvastatin 10 mg/day, ezetimibe 10 mg/day.  CURRENT DISEASE A 49-year-old man, with a coronary event at an early age, who came for a check-up at the heart failure clinic on 13 November 2018. He is asymptomatic in the cardiological sphere. He has not presented angina and has maintained excellent functional class (NYHA I) since starting sacubitrilo-valsartan. On the other hand, since starting treatment with atorvastatin in June 2018, he has complained of significant pain and cramps in the calves and thighs, both at rest and when walking, with normal CPK values. She also presented progressive elevation of transaminases and cholestasis enzymes (with abdominal ultrasound that ruled out hepatobiliary pathology), so, given the suspicion that the symptoms and laboratory alterations could be related to taking atorvastatin, the doses were progressively reduced to 10 mg, without any improvement. Treatment with low doses of other statins (pitavastatin and simvastatin) has also been tried without success and she is currently only clinically tolerating 10 mg of rosuvastatin but with mild alteration of the hepatic profile. In addition to poor tolerance, LDL-C levels have remained persistently elevated at follow-up (LDL-C > 130 mg/dl), despite having associated ezetimibe to lipid-lowering therapy.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION At consultation (17/11/18): Blood pressure 100/65 mmHg. Heart rate (sinus rhythm) 70 beats per minute. Weight 83 kg. Height 189 cm. Abdominal waist 90 cm. Body mass index 23.2 kg/m2. Eupneic at rest, tolerating decubitus. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: regular heart sounds without murmurs or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no adventitial sounds. Abdomen: nondescript. Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pulses preserved and symmetrical. No stigmata of hyperlipaemia.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood test in consultation (11/12/18): glucose 126 mg/dl. HbA1c 6.5%. ALT 82 U/l, AST 55 U/l. Bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl. Gamma-GT 108 U/l. Alkaline phosphatase 85 U/l. CK 92 U. Creatinine 0.86 mg/dl, eGFR by MDRD-4 IDMS > 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Sodium 142 mmol/l. Potassium 4.8 mmol/l. NT-proBNP 544 ng/l. Lipid profile: triglycerides 100 mg/dl, total cholesterol 188 mg/dl, HDL-C 37 mg/dl, LDL-C 160 mg/dl. Apolipoprotein A1 145 mg/dl. Apolipoprotein B 89 mg/dl. ApoB/ApoA1 ratio 0.6 mg/mg. Lipoprotein (a) 90 mg/dl. ECG in consultation (17/11/18): sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. PR interval 140 ms. Narrow QRS with normopositioned axis. QS with residual submillimetric ST segment elevation in V1-V4, with negative T wave in I, aVL and flattened in V5-V6. Transition in V4. No other repolarisation alterations. Echocardiogram in consultation (17/07/18): non-dilated left ventricle, with normal wall thickness except for the sigmoid septum. Moderately depressed global systolic function (LVEF estimated by Simpson biplane 40%). Apical akinesia and akinesia of the middle and distal segments of the anterior face and anterior septum. Hypokinesia of the distal third of the inferior septum. Transmitral filling pattern with impaired relaxation. E/e`12 ratio. Non-dilated atria. Non-dilated right ventricle, with normal global systolic function (TAPSE 15 mm). No significant valvular heart disease. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP) not estimable. Inferior vena cava not dilated, with physiological inspiratory collapse. Aortic root not dilated. No pericardial effusion. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (24/07/18): study compatible with chronic anteroseptal myocardial infarction with moderate ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 35%). Absence of viability in the territory of the anterior descending artery (transmural ischaemic scar of the apex, mid and distal segment of the anterior face and anterior septum, distal half of the inferior septum and distal segment of the inferior face).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Considering the prognostic benefit of the patient (young and at very high cardiovascular risk) and the inability to reach target LDL-C levels despite moderate doses of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, it was decided to start treatment with evolocumab 140 mg (subcutaneous injection) fortnightly. Two weeks after starting evolocumab treatment, LDL-C levels dropped sharply from 160 to 9 mg/dL. The evolution of the lipid profile (including levels of lipoprotein a, Lp [a]) in the successive monthly controls up to the present were as follows: December 2018: total cholesterol 69 mg/dl, HDLc 40 mg/dl, LDLc 9 mg/dl. Lp (a): 45 mg/dl. It is decided to reduce the dose of rosuvastatin from 10 mg to 5 mg. January 2019: total cholesterol 75 mg/dl, HDL-C 42 mg/dl, LDL-C 18 mg/dl. Lp (a): 50 mg/dl. It is decided to withdraw ezetimibe. February 2019: total cholesterol 78 mg/dl, HDLc 39 mg/dl, LDLc 26 mg/dl. Lp (a): 56 mg/dl March 2019: total cholesterol 83 mg/dl, HDL-C 40 mg/dl, LDL-C 25 mg/dl. Lp (a): 52 mg/dl. For the time being (March/2019), the patient has not presented any adverse effects related to treatment with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (iPCSK9) inhibitors; and after the rosuvastatin dose reduction, the hepatobiliary profile has normalised (ALT 22 U/l, AST 25 U/l. ) and the myalgias have disappeared. Other cardiovascular risk factors remain well controlled (blood pressure < 130/90 mmHg, baseline blood glucose < 100 mg/dl; HbA1c < 7%, BMI < 25 kg/m2, abdominal circumference < 94 cm). In light of the CMR results and the evolution of LVEF and functional class, the need for ICD implantation at follow-up remains to be considered.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) functional class I/IV. Moderately depressed LVEF. Late transmural anteroseptal enhancement on CMR. Two-vessel coronary artery disease completely revascularised percutaneously. Drug-eluting stents in DAm-D1 and IVP. Dyslipidaemia. Hypercholesterolemia. Elevation of lipoprotein (a). Statin intolerance. Optimal control of LDL-C and Lp(a) levels after initiation of treatment with iPCSK9. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, with good glycaemic control. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY Cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension (HT), smoker. No diabetes mellitus (DM), no dyslipidaemia (DL).  Cardiological history: 2006: out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) recovered. First rhythm detected: ventricular fibrillation. The output electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST elevation in precordial leads. Catheterisation: non-significant lesion in AMD. Positive acetylcholine test. Transthoracic echocardiogram: normal LVEF, apical septal dyskinesia. She was discharged with a diagnosis of coronary vasospasm and treatment was started with nitrates and calcium antagonists. Subsequent follow-up in cardiology outpatient clinics, she remained stable. It was not possible to increase the dose of diltiazem to maximum doses due to poor tolerance. 2009: admitted for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). On arrival he reported chest pain, the ECG showed ST-segment depression in V1-V2 and I,aVL; he presented peak Tn I of 0.14. Catheterisation: coronary arteries without lesions. Transthoracic echocardiogram: normal LVEF. No segmental alterations. Baseline: independent for basic activities of daily living. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I. Usual treatment: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/d, atorvastatin 20 mg/d, isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg/d, diltiazem retard 120 mg/12h, valsartan 320 mg/12h. Pregabalin, tramadol, naproxen.  CURRENT ILLNESS 50-year-old woman brought to the emergency department by SUMMA after recovered out-of-hospital CRA. Her daughter reported that she woke up this morning with general malaise and chest discomfort. At 8 o'clock in the morning she presented with witnessed CPR and basic CPR manoeuvres were started immediately. The police arrived after a few minutes and continued with basic CPR. On arrival of SUMMA, ventricular fibrillation was observed and sinus rhythm was recovered after a 200 J shock. The basic and advanced CPR manoeuvres lasted 15-20 minutes. The emergency services proceeded with orotracheal intubation, sedation and transfer to our centre.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Intubated, sedated under midazolam perfusion. Blood pressure (BP) 113/83 mmHg without inotropics. Heart rate (HR) 74 bpm. Sat 100% with VMI with FiO2 100%, VT 500, FR 17. Well hydrated, nourished and perfused. Normal colour. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without over-additions. No oedema in the lower limbs. Pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG performed by the emergency services during transfer to our centre: atrial fibrillation at 130 bpm with normal axis (+60) narrow QRS (100 ms), diffuse repolarisation alterations. Normal QTc (430 ms). Chest X-ray on arrival: technically limited plaque, rotated and tilted (no right costophrenic sinus). Aortic elongation. Mediastinum difficult to assess due to the limitations of the X-ray. Cardiothoracic index within the normal range. Unspecific alterations of the pulmonary parenchyma. No left pleural effusion was observed. Analysis and blood gases on arrival: Hb 13.1 g/dl. Leukocytes 23.1 x 103/ul. Platelets 265 000/ul. INR 1. Creatinine 0.97 mg/dl. Na 143 mmol/l. K 3.7 mmol/l. Tn I 3.55 ng/ml. CRP < 2.9 mg/l. pH 7.32, pCO2 49 mm Hg, pO2 87 mm Hg, HCO3 25 mmol/l, lactate 1.8 mmol/l. Transthoracic echocardiogram in the resuscitation room: left ventricle not dilated, not hypertrophic, with normal global systolic function. Apical akinesia. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Atria of normal size. No significant valvular heart disease. No pericardial effusion. Catheterisation: epicardial coronary arteries without significant lesions. Normal ventriculography and aortography.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION At 10:00 hours the patient was admitted to the coronary unit, following catheterisation in which coronary arteries were observed without significant lesions and a transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function with apical akinesia. The patient was monitored and a therapeutic hypothermia protocol was started. In addition, treatment was started with verapamil via nasogastric tube. Target temperature of 32 ̊C was reached at 16:00 hours. He remained stable until 6:58 am the following day when he presented with new ventricular fibrillation. Advanced CPR manoeuvres were started and the patient received multiple unsuccessful defibrillations. The cardiac rhythm became asystole/agonal rhythm with no recovery of spontaneous circulation at any time. The manoeuvres were prolonged for more than 60 minutes without success, and the patient received > 10 mg of adrenaline, two boluses of 300 mg of amiodarone, 2 ampoules of lidocaine and 1 ampoule of magnesium. Death was certified at 8:18 hours. On reviewing the patient's telemetry, ST-segment depression (lead aVF) was observed in the previous minutes, with the appearance of increasingly frequent ventricular extrasystoles that progressively led to ST-segment elevation in this lead and finally an extrasystole with R-over-T phenomenon generated an episode of ventricular fibrillation.  DIAGNOSIS Out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest with first ventricular fibrillation rhythm in the context of MINOCA (acute myocardial infarction with coronary arteries without significant obstructive lesions), possibly related to coronary vasospasm. In-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest and death in a patient under therapeutic hypothermia with first ventricular fibrillation rhythm. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Biochemistry: creatinine 1.32 mg/dl, urea 87 mg/dl, sodium 127 mEq/l, potassium 3.7 mEq/l, bilirubin 1 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 696 U/l, alanine aminotransferase 629 U/l, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase 162 U/l, amylase 97 mg/dl, troponin T 39 ng/l, C-reactive protein 13 mg/dl, procalcitonin 0.15 ng/ml. TSH normal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: regular tachycardia at 200 bpm without visualisation of p waves, normal axis, narrow QRS, ST rectification on the inferolateral side. ECG after cardioversion: atrial fibrillation (AF) at 90 bpm with isolated ventricular extrasystoles, normal axis, narrow QRS, inferolateral ST rectification, normal QT. ICU ECG: regular tachycardia at 140 bpm, inferior axis, wide QRS with morphology of complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and secondary repolarisation abnormalities. ECG after transient pacemaker (PM) implantation: atrial rhythm at 80 bpm stimulated by pacemaker with negative p waves in inferior face with short PR (100 ms), normal axis, QRS 100 ms (widened with respect to baseline) with evident positive pre-excitation in V2-V5. ECG at discharge: RS at 60 bpm, normal axis, PR 120 ms, narrow QRS without pre-excitation, QT 400 ms, no signs of acute ischaemia or repolarisation disturbance. Portable chest X-ray on admission: normal cardiothoracic index. Congestive hilar with slight vascular redistribution. Free costophrenic sinuses. No condensation images. CT scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast on admission: bilateral pleural effusion. Hepatomegaly. Marked reduction in the calibre of the main branches of the abdominal aorta, especially the distal branches of the superior mesenteric, which could justify hypoperfusion of the tributary territory of the same. Echocardioscopy on admission (performed in regular TQ at 190 x ́): LV of normal size with marked global hypocontractility and severe systolic dysfunction. RV of normal size and function. Mitral insufficiency that appears mild-moderate (difficult to quantify in TQ at 190x ́), the rest without relevant incidences. Transthoracic echocardiography prior to discharge: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with slight concentric hypertrophy. No segmental contractility disorders. Diastolic dysfunction grade II. LVEF 65% by Simpson BP. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size and function. Anatomically normal mitral valve with central insufficiency jet reaching the roof of the left atrium (LA) but with protosystolic predominance, which we classify as mild-moderate. The rest of the valves were normal with no pathological flows. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated and with adequate inspiratory collapse.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the ICU in a situation of shock of uncertain origin, in MV and requiring noradrenaline to maintain blood pressure. Given the abdominal symptoms reported by the family prior to admission, it was decided to complete studies with an emergent CT scan of the abdomen, which showed a reduction in the calibre of the main branches of the abdominal aorta with possible hypoperfusion of its tributary territory, so an emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed, which showed no pathological findings. Back in the ICU, echocardioscopy was performed with the finding of marked global hypocontractility and severe systolic dysfunction. Given the situation of shock with vasopressor amines and the persistence of rhythmic tachycardia with narrow QRS at 200 bpm, it was decided to perform electrical cardioversion (ECV) at 200J on suspicion of persistent supraventricular tachycardia, which was effective but the patient immediately presented AF with controlled ventricular rate. The condition was labelled as cardiogenic shock and iv dobutamine perfusion was added, but the patient had a torpid evolution with significant haemodynamic instability despite noradrenaline and dobutamine, progressing to multi-organ failure (oligoanuric liver and kidney failure requiring haemofiltration). From the arrhythmic point of view, the patient presented several subsequent recurrences of narrow QRS tachycardia at 200 bpm, in addition to frequent bouts of wide QRS rhythmic tachycardia at 140 bpm with HRBBB morphology and occasional mildly irregular lower axis. The patient was initially diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia, so amiodarone perfusion was started and discontinued after 24 hours due to QTc prolongation up to 610 ms. Given the persistence of this wide QRS tachycardia, which did not subside with procainamide, esmolol and multiple CVE, a transient pacemaker was implanted for over-stimulation. Incidentally, the pacemaker lead was placed in the coronary sinus, and the post-implantation ECG showed atrial capture with short PR and delta wave suggestive of ventricular pre-excitation. During this period, the patient remained in cardiogenic shock, with persistent multi-organ failure and the need for vasoactive amines. Control echocardiograms showed a slight improvement in ventricular function, but given the persistence of arrhythmic events despite medical treatment and stimulation, and with the suspicion of a possible accessory pathway, it was decided to perform an electrophysiological study (EPS). In the EPS, the clinical wide QRS tachycardia was induced, finding atrial flutter with 2:1 AV conduction and wide QRS with BCRDHH morphology and short HV compatible with pre-excited 2:1 flutter. In addition, bouts of orthodromic tachycardia (regular with narrow QRS) are induced, equal to the clinic with eccentric atrial activation sequence in the coronary sinus with earlier atriogram in S2-S3, which frequently degenerate into pre-excited AF (irregular with irregular wide QRS). Effective ablation was performed on the left posterolateral accessory pathway with disappearance of the pre-excitation 2 seconds after application, and the absence of retrograde conduction through the pathway was verified. After the procedure, the patient returned to the ICU, where she remained in alternating atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (narrow QRS), without pre-excitation and with ventricular response controlled with digoxin. During the following days, he showed good haemodynamic and clinical evolution, allowing extubation, withdrawal of perfusions and transfer to the cardiology ward after stabilisation, where he persisted at all times with controlled HR and alternating AF and flutter monitoring without presenting new bouts of tachycardia. After 15 days of hospitalisation, discharge was decided, with prior performance of a new echocardiography, which showed preserved biventricular systolic function without segmental alterations of contractility, mild-moderate functional mitral insufficiency and diastolic dysfunction.  DIAGNOSIS Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome via left posterolateral approach with orthodromic tachycardia, pre-excited atrial fibrillation and flutter. Tachycardiomyopathy secondary to the above with severe systolic dysfunction recovered after accessory pathway ablation. Cardiogenic shock with multi-organ failure secondary to previous diagnoses. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 85-year-old man, with fasting hyperglycaemia as the only history of interest. Active and independent. He had been admitted a year earlier to the geriatric ward for a first episode of heart failure in the context of lower respiratory tract infection. Clinical evolution was favourable with diuretics and empirical antibiotic therapy. Although he was in sinus rhythm on admission, shortly afterwards he developed atrial fibrillation with slightly elevated ventricular response. An echocardiogram (ECG) was performed with findings of severe ventricular hypertrophy, biauricular dilatation and restrictive diastolic pattern, compatible with infiltrative myocardial disease. He was discharged six days later with acenocoumarol, torasemide 20 mg and bisoprolol 2.5 mg, pending completion of the outpatient study.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: atrial fibrillation with mean ventricular response of 60 bpm, low voltage in limb leads and pseudoinfarction pattern with QS in V1-V2. ANALYTICS: amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) fraction: 4,175 pg/ml, ultra-sensitive troponin T: 65 ng/l. The rest was normal, including haemogram, glycaemia, renal function, liver function, thyroid hormones, ions, lipids and iron study. The protein study was normal, with proteinogram, serum/urine immunofixation and light chains. Control echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle, with severe concentric hypertrophy of granular pattern, maximum thickness of the basal septum 28 mm, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 45-50%. Severe diastolic dysfunction with restrictive pattern and estimated pulmonary capillary pressure of 30 mmHg. Moderate biauricular dilatation. Hypertrophic right ventricle. Thickened mitral valve, with mild insufficiency. Estimated systolic pulmonary pressure 43 mmHg. Mild pericardial effusion. ABDOMINAL ECOGRAPHY: mild hepatomegaly, without other pathological findings. HOLTER ECG: atrial fibrillation with an average heart rate (HR) of 65 bpm. Minimum HR of 35 bpm during nocturnal rest and maximum of 120 bpm during physical exercise. Nonsignificant pauses predominantly at night (the longest lasting 2 seconds). Isolated ventricular extrasystoles, infrequent. Abdominal fat and salivary gland biopsies: negative for amyloid material. CARDIAC MRI: left ventricle with marked diffuse concentric thickening, mild systolic dysfunction. Mild dilatation of both atria. Diffuse parietal late enhancement in all four chambers. Mild pleural effusion, no pericardial effusion. GRAMMAGRAPHY technetium-diphostat (99mTc-DPD): intense biventricular tracer uptake, grade 2. GENETIC STUDY by Sanger sequencing of the TTR gene: negative.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During follow-up, the patient has remained stable, with no new admissions or visits to the emergency room for heart failure. He currently reports dyspnoea on moderate exertion, asthenia, two-pillow orthopnoea and mild malleolar oedema, predominantly in the evening. Blood pressure is usually low and there are episodes of non-syncopal dizziness with orthostatic features. In terms of treatment, acenocoumarol has been replaced by a direct-acting anticoagulant due to poor control of the international normalised ratio (INR), with time in therapeutic range below 30%. Bisoprolol has been withdrawn due to relatively slow heart rate (50-60 bpm) and hypotension (90/60 mmHg). Current medical treatment is rivaroxaban 15 mg, torasemide 10 mg and spironolactone 25 mg, with a flexible diuretic regimen.  DIAGNOSIS Congestive heart failure with mildly depressed ejection fraction, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II. Restrictive cardiomyopathy due to TTR-wild type amyloidosis, with severe biventricular hypertrophy and severe diastolic dysfunction. Permanent atrial fibrillation, with controlled ventricular response. High cardioembolic risk, anticoagulated. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

EVOLUTION It was decided to discontinue enalapril and start sacubitril/valsartan 49/51 mg, one tablet every 12 hours, leaving an enalapril washout period of 36 hours. After 3 weeks, the patient was re-assessed in consultation, with BP of 119/60 mmHg and maintaining renal function and potassium levels in the normal range, so it was increased to 97/103 mg. Two months after starting treatment, a new NTpro-BNP measurement was performed, which was 2900 pg/mL. After 6 months of follow-up, the patient has remained in functional class II-III (subjectively somewhat better than before the change in treatment) and has not been admitted for heart failure. He only visited the emergency department on one occasion for mild decompensation of heart failure related to an upper respiratory tract infection, which could be managed from the emergency department and he was discharged early after 24 hours.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease with severe left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. CF II-III. Intraventricular conduction disorder without criteria for resynchronisation. Partial response to treatment with sacubitril/valsartan, with a decrease in readmissions for heart failure during 6 months of follow-up. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION An 81-year-old woman, dyslipidaemic, hypertensive, obese, with DDD pacemaker due to complete atrioventricular block (AVB), chronic venous insufficiency, hypothyroidism and spondyloarthrosis. She attended the emergency department for a single episode of oppressive central thoracic pain, which did not change with palpation, deep inspiration or movement, not radiating or associated with vegetative cortex, onset at rest, after a situation of family stress, of undetermined duration. There was no evidence of orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, palpitations, dyspnoea at rest or on exertion, malleolar oedema or reduced diuresis. No dietary transgression or modification of his usual medication. No respiratory, abdominal or genitourinary infections. The patient presented cardiologically stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure 200/110 mmHg, afebrile and baseline oxygen saturation 95%. She was conscious and oriented, in good general condition, eupneic at rest, normohydrated, normal colour and normal depth. Carotid pulses were rhythmic and symmetrical and we did not detect jugular ingurgitation. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was rhythmic and without murmurs, with preserved vesicular murmur. Abdominal examination revealed a soft and depressible abdomen, no pain on superficial or deep palpation, no masses or megaliths, generalised tympanism, no peritonism and positive hydro-aerial sounds. The lower extremities showed no malleolar oedema, with symmetrical posterior pedial and tibial pulses present and no stigmata of venous insufficiency or deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests showed haemoglobin 11.4 g/dl, hcto 35.1%, MCH 29.2 pg, MCV 90 fl, normal leukocytes, normal platelets, normal biochemistry, normal CPK, peak troponin-I 6 ng/ml, normal renal function, normal ions and normal coagulation. The portable anteroposterior chest X-ray showed an increased cardiothoracic index, no alterations of the bronchovascular tract, no alveolar or interstitial infiltrates, with free costodiaphragmatic angles. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm at 81 bpm, PR 200 msec, right bundle branch block (RBBB) and HMAIHH, QRS axis at -60o, isodiphasic T waves from V3-V4 and symmetric negative waves from V5-V6 (dynamic changes from baseline ECG) and QTc 394 msec.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit, where enzyme seriation and ECG were completed, and antianginal treatment was started. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a left ventricle at the upper limit of normality, not hypertrophied, with strict anteroapical, inferoapical and apical akinesia and compensatory contractility of basal and middle segments, diastolic pattern of impaired relaxation and moderately depressed systolic function (LVEF 40% by Simpson biplane). The right ventricle was neither dilated nor hypertrophied, with normal systolic function (TAPSE > 18 mm), while the right and left atria were normal in size. The mitral valve had discrete thickening of the valve leaflets, with calcification of the posterior annulus, good opening and a regurgitant jet that was suggestive of mild mitral regurgitation (MR). The aortic valve had trivalve morphology, with good opening and a regurgitant jet, leading to mild aortic insufficiency (AIo), with no apparent dilatation of the aortic root. Morphologically normal tricuspid valve, with good opening and mild insufficiency, which allowed estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP) 50 mmHg. The pericardium had normal thickness and refractoriness, without effusion, and the inferior vena cava was not dilated, and collapsed adequately (>50%) with inspiration. During his stay in the unit he remained cardiologically stable, with a tendency to hypertension, requiring high doses of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and nitroglycerin perfusion. He had no new episodes of angina at rest or on slight exertion, palpitations or dyspnoea. Preferential catheterisation confirmed anteroapical and apical cap dyskinesia, with moderately depressed systolic function, and showed coronary arteries without angiographically significant lesions. Given the clinical and haemodynamic stability, the patient was discharged to the cardiology ward, where she remained asymptomatic, with a tendency to hypertension. After adjustment of treatment with beta-blockers and angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARAII), blood pressure normalised. No periprocedural complications were reported and the patient was discharged with hygienic-dietary recommendations, double antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, ARA-II and statins.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 58-year-old male patient, smoker of one pack of cigarettes/day, with no other medical history of interest, who is referred to the cardiology department for a routine ECG requested by his primary care physician, which turns out to be pathological. In the detailed anamnesis, the patient reported no previous episodes of chest pain, although he did report dyspnoea on moderate exertion, without progression in recent weeks. He also reported that a few days prior to admission he had a sudden episode of loss of strength in the right upper limb and facial paralysis, with subsequent complete recovery, going to his health centre from where he was discharged, citing the cervical origin of the symptoms. Physical examination revealed no findings of interest. An echocardiogram was performed in the consultation room and, in view of the findings, it was decided to admit him to the ward to complete the diagnostic study with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Initially, given the structural cardiac pathology of the patient and the neurological symptoms that he presented days prior to admission, a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) was suspected, so a CT scan of the brain was performed, which was found to be normal. While the patient was on the ward, CMR was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of ventricular pseudoaneurysm with abundant thrombus. He was considered a candidate for surgery and coronary angiography was performed, finding a severe lesion of the mid-distal left main coronary artery (LMCA) and the 3 vessels.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle (LV) moderately dilated, with moderate global systolic dysfunction (LVEF by Simpson biplanar 35%), thinning and inferolateral and inferior akinesia and large inferobasal and inferoseptal basal aneurysm, 44 mm neck and 40 mm deep, with an oval mass of 8 x 7 mm hyperechogenic inside suggestive of thrombus. CHEST X-RAY: showing slight cardiomegaly. ECG: Q waves and negative T waves in inferior leads. Complete ANALYSIS: Haemogram: 14.1 g/dl. Leukocytes 13,500 10^3/μl. Platelets 207,000 10^3/μl. Biochemistry: glucose 134 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.86 mg/dl. Na 139 mM/l. K 4.7 mM/l. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 149 mg/dl. HDL 33.7 mg/dl. LDL 208U/l. Triglycerides 82 mg/dl. Liver profile: bilirubin 0.42 mg/dl. GOT 17.7 U/l. GPT 29.3 U/l. GGT 29.3 U/l. GGT 49.6 U/l. Alkaline phosphatase 128 U/l. Glycated Hb 6.1. Cardiac MRI: ventricular pseudoaneurysm, with image of abundant thrombus in the cul-de-sac, without compromise of mitral valve function, with ventricular remodelling and moderate systolic dysfunction. CORONARYGRAPHY: left coronary trunk: with severe lesion in the distal middle third affecting the ostium of the anterior descending and circumflex arteries. Anterior descending: with severe stenosis in the proximal third, good distal vessel. Circumflex: significant ostial stenosis, occluded at the level of bifurcation with first obtuse marginal which has severe stenosis at the level of bifurcation with subdivision, both vessels of good diameter. Right coronary: dominant, ostial occluded, filled by heterocoronary collateral circulation, regular distal vessel.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient remained asymptomatic during his stay on the ward, wandering around, without presenting arrhythmic events on telemetry. Subsequently, and despite maintaining the patient on correct levels of anticoagulation, he again presented motor deficit in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and right anterior cerebral artery territory of cardioembolic cause and with recovery without subsequent deficit, with no sequelae in the control CT scan performed. The transcranial Doppler study showed significant stenosis in MCA I. Finally, he was transferred to the reference hospital for surgery: by means of median sternotomy and with the aid of extracorporeal circulation, the aneurysmal area was resected, the intraventricular thrombus was removed and the lower wall was reconstructed with a Dacron patch. Subsequent sequential AMI-DA and AMI-OM aortocoronary bypass was performed. Although myocardial protection with antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was performed, removal of extracorporeal circulation proved difficult, requiring high doses of vasoactive amines (dobutamine + noradrenaline). He was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit, where he had a torpid evolution, and died 24 hours after admission due to refractory cardiogenic shock.  DIAGNOSIS Silent infarction complicated by inferior ventricular pseudoaneurysm (with mural thrombus inside). Coronary artery disease of LMCA and three vessels. Moderate left ventricular dysfunction. Surgery for resection of the aneurysmal area + AMI-DA and AMI-OM bypass, with torpid postoperative course and death. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history 47-year-old woman. Cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, long-standing type 2 diabetes with poor metabolic control despite treatment with metformin, vidagliptin, glimepiride and pioglitazone. No previous cardiological history. Other personal history: cholelithiasis. Usual treatment: adiro 100 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg, metformin/vildagliptin 1000/50, pioglitazone, glimepiride.  Current illness Admitted to Cardiology for acute coronary syndrome with Killip I anterolateral ST elevation. An urgent coronary angiography showed an acute subtotal thrombotic lesion of the proximal anterior descending coronary artery which was treated with the implantation of 1 drug-eluting stent. He also had moderate lesions in OM1 and OM2 and diffuse DC disease. Echocardiogram showed moderate ventricular dysfunction (EF 35%) with anterior, apical and anterior septal akinesia. The patient was discharged after 5 days without significant incidents with the following treatment: adiro 100 mg 0-1- 0, prasugrel 10 mg 1-0- 0, pantoprazole 40 mg 1-0- 0, carvedilol 25 mg 1-0- 1, enalapril 5 mg 1-0- 1, atorvastatin 80 mg 0-0- 1, eplerenone 50 mg 1-0- 0, ivabradine 5 mg 1⁄2-0- 1⁄2 and her usual antidiabetic treatment. He was referred to the cardiac rehabilitation programme.  Physical examination BP: 107/55 HR: 65 bpm. Good general condition, eupneic at rest, afebrile. Head and neck: no signs of jugular venous engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones without murmurs or extratonos. AP: preserved vesicular murmur with no extra sounds. Lower extremities: no oedema. Radial and pedial pulses present and symmetrical. Anthropometric examination: weight: 84.5 kg. Height: 162 cm. BMI: 32.1 kg/m2. Abdominal circumference: 112 cm.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: haemoglobin: 12.7 g/dl. Leukocytes: 10300. Platelets: 354000. Normal coagulation. Creatinine 0.9 mg/dl. Urea 70. Na 140.2. K 3,8. Lipoprotein profile (total cholesterol 125 mg/dl; LDL: 82 mg/dl, HDL: 28 mg/dl, Triglycerides: 223 mg/dl). HbA1C 10 %. Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 68 bpm. signs of anterior necrosis. Chest X-ray: slightly increased cardiothoracic index. No signs of heart failure. Echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal size, slightly hypertrophic. Akinesia of the middle and apical segments of the septal, lateral and anterior face, with hypokinesia of the rest of the segments. All this leads to moderate ventricular dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of 35%. Right ventricle of normal size and function. No significant valvulopathies. No pericardial effusion. Catheterisation: TCI: of good calibre, without lesions. LAD: normodeveloped of regular calibre, with subtotal thrombotic lesion in bifurcation with diagonal. Distally very thin vessel. ACX: of good calibre and development, without lesions in the CX itself. The 1st and 2nd OM have moderate ostial lesions. ACD: dominant, diffuse atheromatous involvement, but without severe lesions. PCI With a 3.5 6F XB guide catheter, a BMW guide is passed through the lesion in the LAD. Predilatation with a 2 x 14 mm balloon at 14 atmospheres and implantation of a 2.5 x 16 mm Promus drug-eluting stent at 18 atmospheres with good angiographic results and no complications.  EVOLUTION The patient started a 6-week cardiac rehabilitation programme consisting of motivational talks and physical training 2 days a week. During the programme, the importance of smoking cessation and weight loss was emphasised, but one of the main challenges we had to face was undoubtedly the adjustment of the diabetic treatment. Considering the clinical scenario (young patient with moderate ischaemic ventricular dysfunction and suboptimal diabetic control (HbA1c: 10 %) despite being treated with four oral antidiabetic drugs), we considered the different options and finally decided to: 1) discontinue: pioglitazone, glimepiride and vidagliptin; 2) maintain: metformin; 3) combine: empaglifozin 10 mg/day and insulin therapy (both slow and rapid insulin). The patient successfully completed the programme and achieved weight loss, remained smoke-free and improved glycaemic control.  DIAGNOSIS Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction with Killip 1 anterior ST elevation. Severe proximal CAD treated with 1 drug-eluting stent implantation. Moderate left ventricular dysfunction. Arterial hypertension. Type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor control.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 61-year-old male who consults for dyspnoea.  History No known drug allergies. Ex-smoker. Ex-drinker. Hyperuricaemia with gouty crisis. HYPERTENSION. Dyslipidaemia. Long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus, under treatment with oral anti-diabetics and insulin, with good control. Stage III chronic kidney disease. Cholecystectomy in 2012 for acute calculous cholecystitis. Repeated nephritic colic, requiring admission to the ICU in one of the episodes. Anxious-depressive syndrome being monitored by Psychiatry, with one admission for decompensation in 2005, and subsequently good clinical control with medication. In 2010, he was referred to Pneumology for dyspnoea and a pathological chest X-ray, being diagnosed with sarcoidosis after completing the study with a high-resolution thoracic axial tomography (TACAR) and a biopsy of the mediastinal adenopathies by mediastinoscopy. He was treated for years with oral corticosteroids, which were subsequently withdrawn due to stabilisation of the disease both clinically and radiologically. Follow-up since 2006 in Cardiology Outpatients, being diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy with severe systolic dysfunction. Coronary angiography was performed at that time, which ruled out significant coronary stenosis. The patient admitted to consuming about 40 grams of alcohol per day, which was attributed to the origin of his heart disease. Successive follow-up visits were made; eight months after giving up the alcohol habit, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was found to have recovered to 55%. At that time, he presented an electrocardiogram (ECG) with complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) and a QRS of 120 msec. In 2011, he was admitted to Cardiology for chest pain with typical characteristics. Coronary angiography was repeated, with no significant stenosis in the coronary tree. An echocardiogram was performed, which showed a slightly dilated left ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction (LVEF 45%). On admission, after registering bouts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, anticoagulant treatment was started with acenocoumarol; subsequently, due to a low rate of controls in therapeutic range with dicoumarinic drugs, he was switched to apixaban, without incident. In the following years, during outpatient follow-up, there was evidence of progressive deterioration of LVEF, which fell to 30%, as well as the appearance of signs and symptoms of incipient heart failure. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists was initiated. From then on, in the successive ECGs obtained, he alternates complete right bundle branch block (RBBBH), with other recordings showing a non-specific intraventricular conduction disorder, and QRS between 140 and 150 msec. Usual treatment on admission: spironolactone 25 mg/24 hours, ramipril 2.5 mg/12 hours, carvedilol 12.5 mg/12 hours), allopurinol 100 mg/24 hours, apixaban 5 mg/12 hours, atorvastatin 20 mg/24 hours, digoxin 0.25 mg/24 hours, furosemide 80 mg/24 hours (1-1-0), insulin glargine 16 IU/24 hours, metformin 850 mg-vildagliptin 50 mg/12 hours, omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours, duloxetine 60 mg/24 hours, trazodone 100 mg/24 hours, alprazolam 0.25 mg/24 hours.  Current illness In 2013, she came to the Emergency Department with a 20-day history of progressive increase in her usual dyspnoea (ambulatory class II/IV), until it became minimal effort, with episodes in the last week of orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and bendopnoea limiting any physical activity. He also admits a subjective decrease in diuresis and occasional palpitations at rest, with no history of dizziness or syncope.  Physical examination Normoperfused. Tachypnoea at rest, with use of accessory muscles. Elevation of jugular venous pressure, with positive hepatojugular reflux. O2 saturation 93% with oxygen supply at 3 litres per minute through nasal goggles. Blood pressure 130/70 mmHg. Arrhythmic heart sounds at 100 beats per minute (bpm), no murmurs. Pulmonary crackles up to midfields. Perimalleolar oedema with fovea in both lower limbs. Abdomen soft, depressible, non-painful, without masses or megaliths, with hydro-aerial sounds present.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: haemogram: leucocytes 9,000 10E3/mL (no left shift), haemoglobin 13 g/dL, haematocrit 39%, MCV 92 fl, platelets 163,000 10E3/mL. Coagulation: INR 1.3, PT 60 %, TTPa 32 seconds. Biochemistry: glucose 116 mg/dl, urea 70 mg/dl, creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, FGR (MDMR) 49 ml/min/1.73 m2, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 4.6 mEq/L, liver function tests normal, protein 7.4 g/dl, albumin 4.7 g/dl, cholesterol 132, triglycerides 129, HDL-cholesterol 31, LDL-cholesterol 75, HbA1c 6 %, thyroid hormones normal, proBNP 5900 pg/ml, ultrasensitive troponin T 14 ng/l. Chest X-ray on admission: increased cardiothoracic index. Bilateral hilar thickening. Alveolar-interstitial oedema in both lung fields. Bilateral costophrenic sinus impingement. Fluid in the fissure. Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, PR 180 msec, QRS 150 msec. There was a non-specific intraventricular conduction disturbance that did not fully meet the criteria for HRBBB. Block of the left anterior subdivision of the His bundle (LADB). Frequent supraventricular extrasystoles. Transthoracic Doppler colour echocardiogram: severely dilated left ventricle (end-diastolic diameter of 68 mm), with normal wall thicknesses, and severely depressed systolic function (LVEF 25%) at the expense of generalised hypokinesia, with no segmental contractility abnormalities identified. Right ventricle of normal size and function. No significant valvulopathies were detected. No pericardial effusion. No tricuspid insufficiency or other data suggestive of pulmonary hypertension at rest. Ascending aorta of normal size and Doppler flow. No intracardiac shunts were observed. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): left ventricular dilatation (LVEDV 260 ml, 140 ml/m2; LVESV 180 ml, 100 ml/m2) with severe deterioration of systolic function (LVEF 30%) due to global hypokinesia. Abnormal movement of the interventricular septum typical of bundle branch block. Perfusion study without pathological findings. Late gadolinium enhancement of intramyocardial distribution in basal and middle segments of the interventricular septum. Right ventricle of normal size and morphology, without abnormalities in global and segmental contractility. Dilated left atrium (36 cm2) and right atrium of normal size (20 cm2). Chest X-ray on admission: increased cardiothoracic index. Improvement of signs of heart failure with respect to the image on admission, with persistent alveolar-interstitial oedema in the lung bases and bilateral hilar congestion. ICD-CRT device in cardiac cavities.  EVOLUTION After initiating diuretic and intravenous vasodilator treatment at high doses, progressive improvement of the signs and symptoms of heart failure was achieved. Once clinical stabilisation was achieved, the study was completed with the echocardiogram and cardiac MRI described above. The findings of these tests, together with the histological characterisation of the biopsy of mediastinal adenopathies performed years earlier, pointed to cardiac sarcoidosis as the most plausible cause of our patient's dilated cardiomyopathy. Due to the severe conduction disturbances (with alternating LBBB and non-specific intraventricular conduction disturbance-LBBB-CCRDHH), the occurrence of non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias during monitoring, and the presence of non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction, in NYHA functional class III/IV, and with a QRS of 150 msec (despite not having left bundle branch block morphology at the time of admission), it was decided to implant an ICD-CRT device (cardiac resynchronisation therapy) for primary prevention and to optimise the treatment of heart failure. After titration of the doses of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and Aldosterone receptor antagonists to the maximum tolerated doses, and confirmation of the patient's euvolemia and clinical stability, he was discharged for outpatient follow-up. In the first months after admission, the patient's response to the established therapeutic plan was confirmed, and he remained in stable functional class I-II/IV for two years. In the ECG at follow-up, biventricular pacing rhythm, alternating atrial tachycardia / atrial flutter / baseline sinus rhythm, and with a QRS of 110 msec. However, recently, he required a new admission to the Cardiology hospital ward for decompensated heart failure, as well as several visits to the Emergency Department for intravenous diuretic treatment. Therefore, treatment with sacubitrilo-valsartan was started after suspending ACE inhibitors for 36 hours.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 65-year-old woman with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and active smoking. As personal history, she has a normofunctioning mechanical aortic and mitral prosthesis with preserved ventricular function in outpatient follow-up. She is in permanent atrial fibrillation with frequency control strategy, anticoagulated with sintrom, diagnosed after emboligenic debut in 2014 with episode of transient ischaemic accident without neurological sequelae. She also has unaffiliated chronic kidney disease and moderate polyarticular osteoarthritis. As treatment she takes acenocoumarol 4 mg daily with good control of the usual INR, enalapril 5 mg daily, bisoprolol 10 mg daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, omeprazole 20 mg daily and paracetamol and metamizole alternately for joint pain.  Present illness She presented to the Emergency Department for functional class deterioration 2 weeks after onset. The patient reports dyspnoea that has progressed to rest, orthopnoea previously absent and currently 90 degrees, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea crisis. She also reports oliguria, oedema up to the knees and a feeling of abdominal distension. He also reported frequent episodes of palpitations and the finding of elevated heart rates of over 100 bpm during his ambulatory blood pressure measurement.  Physical examination Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 140 bpm, tachypnoea with slurred speech and basal saturation of 89%. She presented jugular venous engorgement up to 1/3 mid-cervical with venous repletion up to the mandibular angle due to positive hepatojugular reflux, crackles up to midfields, moderately distended abdomen with painful hepatomegaly of 3 crossings and with semiology compatible with mild ascites, and oedema up to 1/3 distal thighs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: tracing compatible with atypical atrial flutter with ventricular response at 140 bpm and wide QRS with BCRDHH morphology. Blood tests: haemoglobin 14.4 mg/dl, platelets 226,000, leucocytes 12.100 with normal formula, INR of 3.49, arterial blood gas with pH 7.44, pO2 54, pCO2 36, Sat O2 86 %, lactate 1.9, bicarbonate 29, creatinine 0.89 mg/dl, sodium 142, potassium 4.4, ALT 55, bilirubin 1.6, alkaline phosphatase 267, GGT 99, NTproBNP 5145. Normal C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. Chest X-ray: increased cardiothoracic index. Bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral hilar infiltrate with evidence of vascular redistribution. Transthoracic echocardiogram: mechanical prosthesis in normopositioned mitral position, with mean gradient of 4 mmHg and effective valve area calculated by THP greater than 2 cm2. Mild insufficiency. Mechanical prosthesis in aortic position with maximum gradient of 28 mmHg and mean gradient of 15 mmHg. Mild insufficiency. Morphologically normal tricuspid valve. Mild-moderate insufficiency. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 38 mmHg. Left ventricle not dilated, slightly hypertrophic, with severely depressed global systolic function (LVEF 22% by Simpson biplane). Akinesia of the inferior and inferolateral sides, and of the basal and middle segment of the septum. Severe hypokinesia of the rest. Slightly dilated left atrium. Slightly dilated right atrium. Dilated right ventricle, severely hypocontractile. TAPSE: 12 mm. No pericardial effusion. Normal aortic root. Dilated inferior vena cava without inspiratory collapse.  EVOLUTION Given the situation of respiratory compromise, the patient was transferred to the Acute Cardiac Care Unit, initiating non-invasive ventilatory support with Bi-PAP, intravenous diuretic and frequency control strategy with intravenous digitalisation, with suboptimal control despite blood digoxin levels in the high range of the safety margin, so intravenous amiodarone and beta-blockers at low doses were added to the treatment after a decrease in congestive signs. Heart rate control was achieved, but the patient remained in atrial flutter with a ventricular response of around 85 bpm. An echocardiogram was performed after initial heart rate control, which yielded the results that can be seen in the complementary tests. In summary, severe biventricular dysfunction was observed with evidence of right congestion, with normofunctioning mechanical prostheses. No significant biauricular dilatation. In view of these findings, coronary angiography was performed, ruling out significant coronary artery disease, and global heart failure with biventricular dysfunction secondary to tachycardiomyopathy was postulated as the first diagnosis. Progressively favourable evolution with good frequency control and reduction of respiratory work and improvement of congestive symptoms. Intravenous amiodarone was withdrawn and oral impregnation was maintained, beta-blockers were progressively titrated up to a maximum dose of 10 mg per day and oral digoxin was maintained, with good control. Spironolactone 25 mg per day and furosemide 40 mg in the morning were added to the treatment, maintaining enalapril 5 mg every 12 hours, acenocoumarol and the rest of his usual medication. Finally, after discussing the case with electrophysiology, considering a complex approach for ablation of atypical flutter substrate requiring left access, an endovascular electrophysiological study was rejected and unsuccessful electrical cardioversion was scheduled after the application of 3 shocks. In euvolemic and stable condition, in atypical flutter with controlled ventricular response, she was discharged and referred for follow-up in the Cardiology Day Hospital and heart failure consultation. Subsequent follow-up in the Cardiology day hospital showed the patient to be stable, in functional class II with no evidence of heart failure decompensation. However, she returned to the emergency department of our hospital 2 months later with global heart failure again, reporting palpitations and elevated heart rates on the home blood pressure monitor. The ECG showed the same atypical atrial flutter at 140 bpm. He was again admitted to the Acute Cardiac Care Unit, where non-invasive ventilation, intravenous furosemide and perfused amiodarone were started again, maintaining beta-blockers and digoxin, with a progressively favourable evolution, although it was impossible to control the heart rate, maintaining symptoms and semiology of decompensated heart failure. Considering the patient's tachycardiomyopathy, with severe biventricular dysfunction, and after ruling out another flutter substrate approach due to the need for left access with potential associated complications in an anticoagulated patient, the Heart Team decided to implant a pacemaker-cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CCP-CRT) in the first stage and later ablation of the atrioventricular node. Thus, during admission, endocavitary left cephalic endocardial CRT-PCM was successfully implanted, which allowed subsequent titration of bisoprolol up to supramax doses of 20 mg per day with very good tolerance, achieving good heart rate control and resolution of acute heart failure. Finally, he was discharged in stable, euvolemic condition, maintaining treatment with furosemide 40 mg per day, acenocoumarol 3 mg per day, spironolactone 25 mg per day, enalapril 5 mg every 12 hours, and bisoprolol 10 mg every 12 hours. The following month, and as scheduled, atrioventricular node ablation was performed without incident, and the patient was discharged from the Cardiology day hospital without requiring hospitalisation. Subsequent follow-up in heart failure consultations was stable, without new episodes of heart failure, with a control echocardiogram at 6 months in which a recovery of left ventricular function (measured by LVEF) of up to 37% was observed, with normofunction of the right ventricle.  DIAGNOSIS Tachycardiomyopathy secondary to atypical atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. Severe biventricular dysfunction. Pacemaker implantation-cardiac resynchronisation therapy and nodal ablation. Rheumatic valve disease. Carrier of normofunctioning aortic and mitral valve prostheses. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

NYHA I/IV.  Present illness Admitted to Urology for radical right nephrectomy, scheduled for 6 September. Anticoagulated with enoxaparin 60 mg/24 h for 5 days prior to surgery (1 to 5 September) and with enoxaparin 40 mg/24 h for 5 days after surgery (6 to 10 September). On 10 September she began to experience dizziness, dyspnoea on exertion and hypotension. Initially assessed by Cardiology, it was interpreted as decompensation of heart failure, diuretics were started and anticoagulation was increased to enoxaparin 80 mg/12h. On day 13, sudden respiratory worsening, requiring OTI and profound hypotension requiring noradrenaline in continuous perfusion at increasing doses (up to 1.5 μg/kg/min). A CT angiography was performed, without finding PET, showing left renal and splenic infarctions. The patient was transferred to the resuscitation unit and on-call cardiology was notified for assessment.  PHYSICAL EXPLORATION (on admission to the Coronary Unit) BP 106/49 mmHg (IABP + noradrenaline); PAP 63/45 mmHg; PCP 50 mmHg; HR 145 bpm; SatO2 97 % (FiO2 80 %); central temperature 38.7°C. Sedated, well adapted to the ventilator. Peripheral lividity, with acral coldness. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic heart at 120 bpm, gallop. Pulmonary auscultation: scattered rhonchi and universal crackles. Abdomen: soft and depressible, no defence on palpation. Lower extremities: lividity, no oedema.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, perihilar alveolar infiltrates, compatible with acute pulmonary oedema. Swan-Ganz catheter in pulmonary branch, counterpulsation balloon at the level of the tracheal carina, orotracheal intubation tube in normal position. Mechanical prosthesis in mitral position. Angio-CT scan: ruled out PTE. Data of heart failure and renal and splenic infarcts. ECG: AF with ventricular response at 130 bpm, axis at 0o. No repolarisation alterations. Analysis on admission to the Coronary Unit: PO2 65 mmHg. PCO2 44 mmHg. pH 7,22. HCO3 18 mmol/l. SaO2 92 %. Lactate 24 mg/dl. Glucose 287 mg/dl. Urea 72 mg/dl. Creatinine 2.45 mg/dl. GPT 55 U/L. CK 89 U/L. LDH 519 U/L. Corrected calcium 8.56 mg/dl. Sodium 133 mmol/L. Potassium 5 mmol/L. C-reactive protein 13.09 mg/dl. Haemoglobin 14.4 g/dl. Haematocrit 44 %. Platelets 227.000/μL. Leukocytes 16,500/μL (neutrophils 83 %). Prothrombin index 70 %. INR 1.28. TTPA 41.3 s. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic, with moderate global dysfunction (estimated LVEF 35-40 %), without clear asynergies. Trivalve aortic valve, without functional alterations. Metal prosthesis in mitral position with restriction of the opening of the antero-medial disc, leaving the postero-lateral disc fixed. Maximum velocity across the valve 230 cm/s, mean gradient 16 mmHg. Severely dilated left atrium. Poor access to right chambers. No pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram: metallic prosthesis in mitral position with restriction of the opening of the antero-medial disc and absence of movement of the postero-lateral disc; leading to an acceleration of flow in systole with maximum velocity and mean gradient coinciding with the TTE. An attempt is made to measure the thrombus, with an approximate diameter of 21.7 mm. Severely dilated left atrium with smoke inside. Left atrial appendage with an image suggestive of thrombus inside.   EVOLUTION On arrival at the resuscitation department, the patient was sedated and intubated, well adapted to the ventilator. Haemodynamically unstable, requiring increasing doses of noradrenaline in continuous perfusion (up to 1.5 μg/kg/min) to maintain TAS 80 mmHg, in atrial fibrillation at 140 bpm. Transthoracic echocardiography (V-Scan) was performed, which showed moderate LV dysfunction, with obstructive thrombus on the mitral prosthetic valve, limiting the opening of the discs. Given the poor clinical and haemodynamic situation, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation was implanted and the patient was transferred to the Coronary Unit, where right pressures were monitored using a Swan-Ganz catheter. The patient has been in anuria since the onset of the condition. Given the history of major surgery in the previous 8 days, the size of the thrombus, the presence of systemic embolisms and the presence of a thrombus in the atrial appendage, fibrinolysis was rejected and the cardiac surgeon on duty was notified, who agreed to perform urgent surgery. Valve replacement with a biological mitral valve prosthesis (Perimount plus no. 27) was performed. During the postoperative period, in the Coronary Unit, he developed septic shock secondary to pneumonia, without any germ being isolated in the cultures. He was treated with intensive antibiotic therapy, with good evolution. Two weeks later he was transferred to the hospital ward. She was finally discharged from hospital one month after cardiac surgery.  DIAGNOSIS Right radical nephrectomy for hypernephroma. Thrombosis on mechanical mitral prosthesis in relation to perioperative bridging therapy with enoxaparin. Secondary cardiogenic shock. Mitral valve replacement with biological prosthesis. Septic shock due to right basal pneumonia, resolved. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Laboratory tests: Myocardial damage marker curve: ultrasensitive troponin T (TnTus) 58.7 to 420 pg/ml at 3h (normal values < 14 pg/ml). N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) 157 pg/ml. D-dimer 1560 ng/ml. Other biochemistry, haemogram and coagulation anodine. Bedside echocardioscopy: non-dilated left ventricle with preserved LVEF and anterior hypokinesia at mid-apical level. Non-dilated right ventricle with good systolic function. Absence of significant valvular heart disease. Absence of pericardial effusion. Abdominal ultrasound: placental debris ruled out. Coronary angiography 1: abrupt decrease in the calibre of the middle and distal anterior descending artery after the exit of the second diagonal developed, image compatible with spontaneous coronary dissection. Distal flow TIMI 3. Rest of arteries without lesions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the coronary unit with stable, pain-free condition, with low-dose nitroglycerine perfusion and controlled blood pressure, and early coronary angiography was performed with the findings described. Given the absence of angina and TIMI 3 distal flow, conservative management in the coronary unit was initially decided. In the following days, the patient presented several short episodes of precordial pain lasting a few minutes, with no electrical changes or increase in markers of myocardial damage. On the third day of admission, she presented a new episode of pain of greater intensity, with an electrocardiogram (ECG 3) showing ST-segment elevation >1mm in V1 to V4 and 0.5mm in III and aVF. It was decided to perform a new coronary angiography (video 2. Coronary angiography 2) which showed distal progression of the dissection, with worsening of the lumen of the artery at the medial level and complete collapse of the same in the apical segment, with weak homolateral collaterals (Rentrop 1). Given the haemodynamic stability, the disappearance of pain with electrocardiographic improvement after medical treatment and the location of the occlusion in the distal-apical segment, conservative management was again decided, with good initial evolution and progressive decrease in markers of myocardial damage. Six days later, the patient presented a new episode of intense precordial pain accompanied by haemodynamic deterioration with hypotension (TAS 70 mmHg) requiring vasoactive drugs, respiratory deterioration, radiological worsening compatible with acute pulmonary oedema (chest X-ray) and new elevation of myocardial damage markers from 500 to 3750 pg/ml. The ECG (ECG 4) shows ST-segment elevation > 2 mm in V4-V5 and 0.5 mm in II, III and aVF. It was decided to perform a new coronary angiography (Coronary angiography 3) which showed progression of the dissection at the proximal level, with complete occlusion of the vessel at the middle level and distal vessel weakly visualised by homocoronary collaterals (Rentrop 1). In view of the shock situation and TIMI 0 flow, it was decided to intervene guided by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and after placing the angioplasty catheter and passing the guidewire to ADA and diagonal, an image of dissection in the distal left coronary artery (possibly facilitated by the tip of the catheter on a susceptible intima) with TIMI 0 flow in all branches was observed. A 3.5 x 28 mm drug-eluting stent was implanted in the coronary trunk to the proximal anterior descending coronary artery and a second 3.5-3.0x60 mm stent was implanted distally, restoring TIMI 3 flow in the distal anterior descending artery although with persistent non-occlusive dissection, and first diagonal with TIMI 1 flow. Finally, conservative management of the circumflex artery ostium was chosen after restoring distal TIMI 3 flow, once the entry port had been sealed. The patient evolved favourably over the following days, with resolution of the shock situation and discharge to the cardiology ward. Regular echocardiography was performed (video 4) and the study was completed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (video 5), showing dilatation of the left ventricle with severe depression of its systolic function (LVEF 34%) secondary to alterations in segmental contractility in apical segments and on the lateral side, transmural necrosis of 4 segments of the LAD territory (apical segments) and non-transmural necrosis on the lateral side. During follow-up at discharge from the heart failure unit, prognostically evident drugs were prescribed and, given the absence of improvement in systolic function, an ICD was placed for primary prevention.  DIAGNOSIS Spontaneous coronary artery dissection associated with pregnancy. Non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  We present the case of an 89 year old male with a history of: Arterial hypertension under treatment with good control. Common flutter treated with cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. Implantation of a VDD pacemaker in 2007 after cardiogenic syncope (no reports). Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in 2013 with coronary angiography showing no significant lesions. Usual treatment: ramipril 2.5 mg at breakfast, omeprazole 20 mg at breakfast, atorvastatin 40 mg at dinner, tamsulosin/dutasteride 0.4/0.5 mg at breakfast, bisoprolol 5 mg at lunch, acenocoumarol as prescribed, calcifediol 0.266 mg monthly. Baseline condition: physically active, no cognitive deterioration. The patient was under cardiological follow-up for aortic stenosis, of degenerative origin, progressing to severe, the patient being asymptomatic. Last echocardiographic control in October/19, where preserved LVEF and severe aortic stenosis were found: aortic valve area (AVA) by continuity equation of 0.72 cm2 (0.38 cm2/m2), maximum/average gradients of 79/44 mmHg, a maximum velocity of 4.5 m/s and an integral LVOT/aorta ratio of 0.21. In January 2021, a telephone consultation was made in which the patient reported that he continued to carry out his daily activities without difficulty and was asymptomatic, in class I of the New York Heart Association (NYHA). Two months after this consultation, the patient needed to be hospitalised in another centre for acute heart failure in the context of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The patient made good progress on the ward with diuretic oxygen therapy. His doctors contacted our clinic, and the patient was discharged without congestive data and with an appointment for preferential assessment in the week following hospital discharge. However, a few days after discharge, the patient needed to visit the emergency department of our centre due to the appearance of oppressive chest pain triggered by slight exertion, which subsided with rest and which was self-limiting, with none of the episodes lasting more than 5 minutes. In addition, she reports a feeling of dizziness that makes it difficult for her to walk. All this has occurred since the last hospital admission. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 160/83 mmHg at 64 beats per minute, saturation of 98% of ambient air and normothermia. There was also an ejection murmur in aortic focus III/VI, radiating to the suprasternal and carotid cavities with effacement of the second tone. Pulmonary auscultation showed bibasal crackles. Oedema with pretibial fovea in both lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Last outpatient echocardiogram: severe aortic stenosis with the following additional data: aortic valve area (AVA) by continuity equation of 0.72 cm2 (0.38 cm2/m2), maximum/average gradients of 79/44 mmHg, a maximum velocity of 4.5 m/s and an integral ratio of 0.21. ED electrocardiogram (digitised recording not available): alternating sinus rhythm around 70 bpm with electro-stimulated tachycardia 130 bpm. Chest X-ray in the ED: study limited by technique. Increased cardiothoracic index, without clear parenchymal consolidation. Impression of absence of pleural effusion. Normopositioned pacemaker electrocatheter. Emergency blood tests: CBC: red cells 4.77 xmill/μl, haemoglobin 13.2 g/dl, haematocrit 39.1%, MCV 82.1 fl, MCH 27.7 pg, MCHC 33.8 g/dl, RDW 17.0%, platelets 216 x1000/μl, MPV 9.2 fl, leukocytes 8.3 x1000/μl, neutrophils 5.9 x1000/μl, neutrophils % 71.3%, lymphocytes 1.3 x1000/μl, lymphocytes % 15.8%, monocytes 1.0 x1000/μl, monocytes % 12.0%, eosinophils 0.0 x1000/μl, eosinophils % 0.6%, basophils 0.0 x1000/μl, basophils % 0.3%. Biochemistry: glucose 120 mg/dl, creatinine 1.85 mg/dl, sodium 128 mEq/l, potassium 4.21 mEq/l, chlorine 83 mEq/l, ALT (GPT) 33 U/l, AST (GOT) 36 U/l, gamma-GT 41 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 89 U/l, LDH 290 U/l, bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, CK 87 U/l, troponin T hs 852.6 ng/l, NTproBNP 14,106 pg/ml, C-reactive protein 0.84 mg/dl. Haemostasis: prothrombin activity 9%, prothrombin time 79.5 s, INR (lab) 7.76, TTPa 51 s, fibrinogen (derivative) 405 mg/dl, D-dimer 243 ng/ml. Blood tests during admission: enzyme serology with peak troponin T hs of 1,440 ng/l. Echocardiogram during admission: non-dilated left ventricle with moderate hypertrophy. Segmental contractility alterations: global hypokinesia and apical, inferior and inferolateral inferoseptal akinesia with severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 33%). The aortic valve was severely calcified and unstructured with marked restriction of leaflet mobility: AVA 0.48 cm2 (0.26 cm2/m2), peak/average gradients of 87/52 mmHg, peak velocity of 4.7 m/s and an integral ratio of 0.12, all compatible with severe-critical aortic stenosis. In addition, the tricuspid valve exhibited mild insufficiency allowing an estimated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure of 63 mmHg. Coronary angiography: significant calcification of the coronary tree. Left main coronary artery of good calibre, with mild atheromatosis. Anterior descending artery (LAD) of good calibre and development. Proximal LAD with mild atheromatosis. Mid LAD with moderate focal lesion at the level of the bifurcation with the 2nd dominant diagonal without lesions. Distal LAD without lesions. Non-dominant circumflex with moderate ostial atheromatosis. Dominant right coronary artery with diffuse mild atheromatosis. Study superimposable to the previous one in 2013.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the chest pain with elevated troponin T hs and semiological data compatible with decompensation of heart failure, depletive treatment with intravenous furosemide was started in the emergency department, obtaining a favourable response and subsequently allowing the patient to be started on drugs for ventricular dysfunction. On the other hand, in view of the patient's tachycardia, the pacemaker was interrogated, confirming a pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, which was resolved after extending the post-ventricular atrial refractory period. A new transthoracic echocardiogram showed a non-dilated left ventricle with moderate hypertrophy, alterations of segmental contractility: global hypokinesia and apical, inferior and inferolateral inferoseptal akinesia with severely depressed systolic function (LVEF 33%). The aortic valve was severely calcified, with the following additional data: AVA 0.48 cm2 (0.26 cm2/m2), peak/average gradients of 87/52 mmHg, peak velocity of 4.7 m/s and an integral ratio of 0.12, all compatible with severe-critical aortic stenosis. In addition, the tricuspid valve exhibited mild insufficiency allowing an estimated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure of 63 mmHg. Given the previous findings, coronary angiography was performed and showed non-significant coronary lesions. The case was discussed in a medical-surgical session and transcatheter valve implantation via the femoral artery (TAVI) was chosen. In addition, the possibility of urgent percutaneous valvotomy was considered if the patient's situation required it at some point during admission. However, the patient evolved favourably and was discharged pending completion of the outpatient TAVI study.   DIAGNOSIS Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Pacemaker-mediated tachycardia. Decompensation of heart failure secondary to previous. Acute myocardial infarction without type II ST elevation within the prior. Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Severe pulmonary hypertension. Acute renal failure. Mild hyponatraemia. Acenocoumarol overdosage. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O

EVOLUTION The patient started on 14th November at 23:00 hours with oppressive central thoracic pain radiating to the left arm with sweating. The patient remained at home and decided not to consult the doctor because he did not attach any importance to the situation. After spending the whole night with pain and persisting with the same on the morning of the 15th he decided to go to his reference hospital, where on arrival an ECG was performed (15/11/14 described in complementary tests). STEMI was detected and primary PCI was decided. On the cardiology ward, the patient evolved favourably and a TSH of 9 was discovered, so levothyroxine was increased.

Furosemide 40 mg, half a tablet at breakfast. Eplerenone 25 mg, 1 tablet at midday. Atorvastatin 80 mg, 1 tablet at dinner.  It was decided not to introduce beta-blockers due to asthmatic bronchitis.  The patient came to the emergency department on 11 December due to the onset of chest pain of atypical characteristics lasting hours and exacerbating with respiratory movements. No clinical signs of decompensation of heart failure. The analytical tests performed and the ECG were similar to those on discharge from hospital and the pain subsided with the usual intravenous analgesia (paracetamol, metamizole), so he was discharged from the emergency department. He returned to the ED on 16 December due to recurrence of atypical chest pain, which caused shortness of breath, increasing with inspiration and lasting for hours, as well as symptoms compatible with heart failure (dyspnoea on minimal exertion, orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea). He also reported cough with whitish expectoration without thermometric fever.  Pneumonia was suspected in the emergency department and he was admitted to Internal Medicine with a diagnosis of pneumonia.  During admission to Internal Medicine, complementary tests were carried out which revealed a pseudoaneurysm on apical aneurysm and so he was referred to a referral hospital with Cardiac Surgery, being admitted under the care of Cardiology. The patient was presented at the medical-surgical session where he was finally accepted for surgery and underwent surgery on 30 December. He had occasional chest pain with pleuro-pericardial characteristics and clopidogrel was withdrawn 5 days prior to surgery. Surgery was performed: resection of the ventricular aneurysm by means of a central incision and implantation of a Dacron patch. The patch was covered with the walls of the pseudoaneurysm, which was reinforced with three Teflon strips, with no intraoperative incidents. During his stay on the Cardiac Surgery ward, he evolved favourably, starting to ambulate, with no signs of decompensated heart failure, and was discharged on 13/01/15.  Pharmacological treatment on discharge from the Cardiovascular Surgery ward (13/01/15): Usual medication for benign prostatic hypertrophy, dyspepsia and hypothyroidism same. Aspirin 100 mg, 1 tablet at breakfast. Clopidogrel 75 mg, 1 tablet at breakfast. Omeprazole 20 mg, 1 tablet at breakfast. Atorvastatin 40 mg, 1 tablet at dinner. Bisoprolol 2.5 mg, 1 tablet at breakfast. Ramipril 2.5 mg, 1 tablet at breakfast. Eplerenone 25 mg, 1 tablet at lunch. Furosemide 40 mg, at breakfast.  DIAGNOSIS Contained cardiac rupture: pseudoaneurysm over apical aneurysm. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Personal history The patient is a 53-year-old male, with no drug allergies. Type 2 diabetes mellitus of 3 years of evolution, treated with oral antidiabetics with good control, without other classic cardiovascular risk factors. Depressive syndrome under pharmacological treatment  In August 2014 (4 months prior to admission to the emergency department) he underwent an outpatient study in Internal Medicine due to asthenia, anorexia and weight loss with splenomegaly and Raynaud's, positive ANAs 1/640 with homogeneous nucleolar pattern and positive aniScl 70; a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis was established and immunosuppressant treatment, haemorrheological treatment and calcium antagonists were started.  The patient continues chronic treatment with methotrexate 15 mg every 24 hours, pentoxifylline 400 mg every 24 hours, diltiazem 60 mg every 8 hours, calcium folinate 15 mg every 24 hours, omeprazole 20 mg every 24 hours, glimepiride 2 mg every 24 hours and desvenlafaxine 50 mg every 24 hours.  Current illness 48 hours prior to his arrival at the ED, the patient reported marked asthenia and dyspnoea on minimal exertion, for which he discontinued diltiazem on the recommendation of his primary care physician. Despite this, his symptoms persisted and his dyspnoea even worsened the following morning, so his family called 112 and he was attended at home by the SAMU who performed an electrocardiogram (ECG) which revealed complete atrioventricular block (AVB) with wide QRS escape at 30x ́, deciding on superficial sedation, implantation of a transcutaneous pacemaker and transfer to the Emergency Department of our centre.  He denied any other symptoms of heart failure, fever or other symptoms of interest. On arrival at the ED, a new ECG showed complete AVB with wide QRS leakage alternating with transcutaneous MCP rhythm in command mode with no capture failures, and on telemetry, asymptomatic, self-limited bouts of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia of the torsades de pointes type. Urgent admission to the Coronary Unit was decided.  Physical examination in the emergency department Blood pressure: 170/90 mmHg. Heart rate 65 beats per minute with transcutaneous MCP. To 36.2 °C.

Immunofluorescence: C1q: (-), C3: (+) focal mesangial granular, C4: (-), IgA: (-), IgG: (-), IgM:(-), albumin: (+) in tubular basement membranes and Bowman's capsule, fibrinogen: (-) kappa and lambda light chains:(-).  Summary: tubulointerstitial nephropathy with severe involvement and secondary vascular changes.  EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the coronary unit where a provisional pacemaker was implanted via the right jugular vein, maintaining the MCP rhythm in a command regime and without any new rhythm alterations being observed in the telemetry. Haemodynamically stable with normal baseline blood gases and BP 160/90, amlodipine 5 mg/12h was added to the usual treatment (without diltiazem). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a non-dilated LV with severe hypokinesia of the middle and apical septal segments, slightly impaired systolic function, prolonged relaxation with non-high filling pressures, right chambers of normal size and function, mitral insufficiency grade II/IV and PSAP 37+PVC. The following morning, DDDR definitive MCP was implanted, being in MCP rhythm on command and with no new pathological findings on monitoring, but BP 160/95 persisted despite treatment with amlodipine 10 mg/12h and doxazosin 8 mg/24h in a patient with no known chronic hypertension and with elevated renal function figures since admission. On the afternoon of the implant, the patient began sudden dyspnoea with BP 220/130 in a situation of radiological APE with bilateral pleural effusion, respiratory acidosis with global respiratory failure requiring the start of non-invasive ventilation with BIPAP, intensive diuretic treatment, intravenous nitrates and combination with full-dose antihypertensive drugs (amlodipine, doxazosin); ACE inhibitors were not started due to renal dysfunction. A new emergent TTE was performed, which showed the previous findings. After 8 hours of treatment, there was a clear clinical, radiological and blood gas improvement, so non-invasive ventilation was withdrawn and diuretic treatment was reduced; however, persistently high BP levels persisted despite high-dose IV NTG and full doses of amlodipine and doxazosin; and the deterioration of renal function with proteinuria and haematuria was increasing, although with negative balances, accompanied by plateletopenia and anaemia with reticulocytosis. Again 72 hours after the episode of PAD, he suffered a new crisis of dyspnoea accompanied by a hypertensive crisis with figures of 190/100 with worsening renal function and oliguria. At this point, taking into account the patient's history and the complementary tests (see section on complementary tests), a presumptive diagnosis was made, which was later confirmed with definitive diagnostic tests. Specific treatment was prescribed, with improvement of the respiratory symptoms and control of BP levels. However, the deterioration of renal function was persistent and progressive, requiring a right femoral catheter for haemodialysis. Subsequently, a renal biopsy was performed which revealed tubulointerstitial nephropathy and vascular involvement that led to stage V renal disease with the need for renal replacement therapy. A right jugular tunnelled catheter was placed and the patient was discharged home (day 58 since admission) on an outpatient chronic haemodialysis programme. Subsequent outpatient evolution was very unfavourable and despite specific treatment and haemodialysis first every 48 hours and then daily, the patient died two months later.  DIAGNOSIS Diffuse systemic sclerosis with scleroderma renal crisis. Pulmonary fibrosis 2nd to pulmonary involvement of diffuse systemic sclerosis. Complete atrioventricular block, myocardial fibrosis and mild ventricular dysfunction 2nd to cardiac involvement of diffuse systemic sclerosis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 57-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic atrial fibrillation. She has had a mitral valve prosthesis for six months (surgery at a private centre in March 2014) due to a double rheumatic mitral lesion with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). The preoperative echocardiogram also showed a moderate double aortic lesion, moderate pulmonary hypertension and non-dilated left ventricle with preserved systolic function. On chronic treatment with aldocumar, digoxin, metformin/vildagliptin, carvedilol, spironolactone, escitalopram and furosemide. She was referred from a private clinic for progressive dyspnoea in the last three weeks to the point of minimal effort, two-pillow orthopnoea and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. She has not presented chest pain or other associated symptoms. No infectious episodes since surgery, fever or febrile fever. No recent invasive dental or surgical procedures.  On examination she had: ʟʟ BP: 108/74 mmHg. hR: 94 bpm. ʟʟʟ Ta: 36 °C. ʟʟʟ Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic, with presence of mitral click, systolic murmur in aortic focus IV/VI and systolic murmur in tricuspid focus. pulmonary auscultation: crepitant sounds in both bases. No other relevant findings.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: atrial fibrillation at 93 beats per minute, with evidence of systolic overload. Blood tests: haemogram within the normal range, biochemistry and renal and hepatic function parameters without alterations, INR 1.9. There was a discrete mobilisation of myocardial damage markers in plateau (troponin I 1.9-1.7 ng/mL); NT-ProBNP 20528, HbA1C 8.6% and ESR 25. Blood cultures were negative in two independent determinations. Chest X-ray on admission: mitral valve prosthesis and reinforcement of the peribronchovascular mesh, with no other significant findings. Initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and serial transesophageal echocardiograms (TEE). Initial TTE: left ventricle slightly hypertrophic, dilated (VTD 154/ VTS 115 ml), with severe depression of LVEF (by Simpson 25%). Global hypokinesia. MAPSE 8 mm. Mitral filling pattern with single E wave. Dilated LA, AP diameter 68 mm, area 48 cm2. Sclerocalcified aortic valve, with limited opening (M-mode 0.8). Double aortic lesion, both of which appear moderate. Maximum gradient 33, mean 21.5 mmHg; IVT AVAo of 0.9 cm2 (LVOT diameter 18 mm), with low systolic volume (47 mL). Moderate aortic insufficiency. Mechanical mitral prosthesis with correct opening of both hemidiscs. Maximum velocity 2 cm/s. No significant leaks. Right ventricle with DTD in apical 4C of 40 mm at basal level, midventricular of 31 mm. TAPSE of 10 mm. S" wave 5 cm/s. Dilated RA. Moderate TR. RV-AD gradient of 45 mmHg. IP trivial. Transpulmonary acceleration time 85 ms. Dilated IVC (20 mm) that does not collapse with inspiration. No pericardial effusion. ETE 1: FEVI <20%. Preserved mitral prosthetic opening, maximum velocity 1.7 m/s. Mild periprosthetic leak. Images on mitral annulus of morphology and density compatible with thrombotic tamponade and less probably pannus. Image on ventricular side of prosthetic annulus interposed between disc and annulus, causing mild insufficiency. Dense spontaneous contrast effect in LA and left atrial appendage. Image in the LA roof at the mouth of the left pulmonary veins showing thrombus. Calcified trivalve aortic valve, with severely reduced opening but could be due to reduced transvalvular volume (VAo planimetry 0.7 cm2). Aortic annulus 19 mm. Ascending aorta 31 mm. Dilated RV, tricuspid annulus 45 mm. Moderate TR. No intracardiac shunts. TEE 2: partial resolution of the echodense image around the mitral prosthetic ring. It presents two mobile images: the largest (13x9 mm) anchored in the anterior annulus, retroaortic, low echogenicity, deflected, which prolapses in diastole through the annulus. The smallest in the posterior annulus (4 mm). Compatible in this context with evolution to residual hypermobile thrombus as first option. No periprosthetic insufficiencies. Image compatible with fixed mural thrombus at the entrance of the left atrial appendage. Significant smoke effect in the entire atrium. There is still a mural echodense image at the bottom of the left atrium in relation to the origin of the right pulmonary vein described in the previous study. TEE 3: large echodense image in the atrial side of the mitral prosthesis that generates complete blockage of the anterior prosthetic disc, with transprosthetic gradients: maximum 8.1 and average 3.8 mmHg. Significant smoke effect in the left atrium and in the atrial appendage, the latter presenting an image suggestive of upholstery on its lateral wall. Coronary angiography: non-significant stenosis in the ostial trunk, around 30%. The rest of the coronary arteries had no lesions.  EVOLUTION Patient with the aforementioned history, with a mitral prosthesis for six months, admitted for heart failure. Diuretic treatment was started with a good response and systolic function and valve functionality were re-evaluated. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a normally functioning mitral prosthesis and moderate-severe aortic stenosis. In evaluation with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), an image compatible with intraventricular thrombus lining the mitral annulus was observed and treatment with sodium heparin and ASA was started. Subsequent echographic controls showed an increase in its size, which came to block the anterior prosthetic disc despite APTT in the appropriate range. Blood cultures were taken and were negative in serial determinations. The patient was stable and afebrile, in good general condition and ambulating around the ward, with no evidence of heart failure. On the tenth day of admission, she presented acute pain in the right lower limb, with a sensation of paraesthesia and distal pallor and echo-Doppler data of acute ischaemia of the right lower limb. Urgent transfemoral embolectomy of the right external iliac artery was performed, with recovery of distal pulses and triphasic Doppler flow on leaving the operating theatre. With the diagnosis of suspected prosthetic thrombosis with poor evolution complicated by peripheral embolism, urgent surgery was requested on prosthetic mitral valve and aortic valve replacement, as the patient met the criteria for this. Surgical cleaning of the mitral prosthesis was carried out, which was found to be covered and partially blocked by a mass that appeared to be a large thrombus, and sent to the microbiology laboratory for analysis. The aortic valve was also replaced with a metallic prosthesis. The patient was admitted to the resuscitation unit sedated, haemodynamically stable and respiratory stable with invasive mechanical ventilation. Eight hours after admission to the unit, a positive result was reported for Aspergillus in the septifast of the "mitral valve thrombus", so treatment was started with amphotericin B and voriconazole and the case was re-evaluated, and a new urgent surgery was scheduled for removal of the mitral prosthesis. Intracardiac cleaning with amphotericin B and implantation of a new mechanical prosthesis was performed without complications during the procedure. Adequate stabilisation was achieved with suspension of vasoactive agents and extubation was performed after 48 hours, with good tolerance.  Five days after surgery, the patient had decreased visual acuity in the right eye. On neurological examination she presented right homonymous haemianopsia on threat examination, with no other alterations. An urgent cranial CT scan was performed, which revealed a 2.5 cm cystic lesion in the left occipital lobe with adjacent oedema compatible, in the clinical context of the patient, with aspergilloma (figure 1). Overall, the picture is labelled as a stroke in the left posterior cerebral artery territory with a haemorrhagic/infectious component probably related to septic embolus due to Aspergillus. Once the need for neurosurgical intervention was dismissed, antifungal coverage was extended with caspofungin. One week postoperatively, he presented a sudden clinical deterioration with acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and intense haemodynamic instability requiring high-dose amine support. Urgent TEE was requested, which showed severe depression of global LV contractility without segmental alterations and normofunctioning prosthetic valves, without definitive data of pulmonary thromboembolism. Finally, exitus was triggered by electromechanical dissociation despite advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation measures.  Subsequent analysis of the valve revealed the presence of a dense, partially thrombosed structure anchored to the prosthetic disc, composed of thick septate and branched mycelia, compatible with aspergilloma. Aspergillus fumigatus grew in the culture of this mass.  DIAGNOSIS Fungal endocarditis on prosthetic mitral valve, complicated by: Prosthetic valve block. Peripheral embolism with acute ischaemia of the right lower limb, requiring urgent embolectomy. Stroke in left posterior cerebral artery territory of probable septic origin (aspergilloma). Cardiogenic shock, electromechanical dissociation. Exitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Background A 37-year-old man of South American origin who had been living in Spain for 5 years. No drug allergies. Active life. No cardiovascular risk factors. No toxic habits. No family history of cardiomyopathy or other hereditary diseases. No relevant medical-surgical history.  Current illness The patient came to the Cardiology department referred by his company doctor after a routine medical examination revealed striking electrocardiographic alterations. He reported only sporadic episodes of regular palpitations of short duration (2-3 minutes) unrelated to exertion that subsided spontaneously, with a weekly frequency. She denies chest pain or dyspnoea. She has not presented syncope.  Physical examination Good general condition. BP: 110/60 mmHg. HR: 60 bpm. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, fixed splitting of the second sound. No murmurs or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without rales. Abdomen: soft and depressible, not painful on palpation, no masses or organomegaly. Lower limbs: no oedema. Symmetrical paedial pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm, first-degree atrioventricular block (PR 210 ms), complete right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock, convex ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in precordial leads. 24-hour Holter: no supra- or ventricular arrhythmias were detected. No evidence of advanced atrioventricular block. Laboratory tests: glucose 98 mg/dL, urea 32 mg/dL, creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (CrCl 110 ml/ min/1.73 m2 -CKD-EPI), sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 4 mEq/L, NT-proBNP 102 pg/ml, CK 387 ng/ml, CK-MB 9.8 ng/ml, TnT 0.01, haemoglobin 14 g/dL, haematocrit 45%, MCV 85 fL, leucocytes 7980 /mm3, platelets 270000 /mm3, INR: 0,9. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, no pulmonary infiltrates, free costophrenic sinuses, normal mediastinum. Transthoracic echocardiography: LV slightly dilated (LVEDD indexed by CS of 3.3 cm/m2) with normal wall thickness. No alterations in segmental contractility. LVEF 52%. Transmitral Doppler filling pattern of impaired relaxation. RV of normal dimensions with systolic function by longitudinal parameters at the lower limit of normality. Cardiac MRI: minimal dilatation of both ventricles (LVEDV 181/VTSVI 96 ml) with slightly depressed biventricular systolic function (LVEF 50%). The late enhancement sequence showed multiple foci of transmural enhancement with patchy distribution of septal, basal lateral and apical predominance suggestive of fibrosis.  EVOLUTION Taking into account that the patient came from a Chagas disease endemic area, serological tests were performed to detect circulating antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi: both were positive (ELISA 8 and immunofluorescence >1/160), confirming the diagnosis of chronic infection by this parasite. Oesophagogastric barium transit and abdominal radiography were also performed and ruled out gastrointestinal involvement. The patient was diagnosed with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCM) based on the results of serology, ECG, transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac MRI; and treatment with benznidazole 100 mg/8h for two months was indicated and completed with good tolerance. Ten months after diagnosis, the patient died suddenly while playing tennis. He was attended by the emergency services who detected asystole as the first rhythm on arrival. Advanced CPR manoeuvres were unsuccessful and the patient finally died. As death occurred in an out-of-hospital environment, a forensic autopsy was performed. Macroscopic and microscopic examination of the heart confirmed the characteristic involvement of CCM.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. Dilatation and mild biventricular systolic dysfunction with transmural patchy LV fibrosis. Sudden cardiac death. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Personal history We present the case of a patient who consulted for dyspnoea. She was a 69-year-old woman with no adverse drug reactions and type 2 diabetic on treatment with metformin 850 mg and slow insulin 20 units per day. She had no known previous heart or lung disease. She is in a baseline NYHA I condition. He is not limited in physical activity. Present illness For the last week he has been experiencing dyspnoea on moderate exertion. He refers to going out for walks without being able to follow his usual rhythm. Since the day before admission, he has had episodes of nausea, sweating and dizziness with a worsening of the degree of dyspnoea, for which he decides to consult the doctor.  Physical examination BP: 150/72. HR: 91 bpm. Ta afebrile. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones. II/VI murmur in aortic focus with 4s. Pulmonary auscultation: teleinspiratory crackles in lung bases. Abdomen: soft and depressible, non-painful on palpation, with no palpable masses or megaliths. Lower limbs: Minimal oedema in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Complementary examinations in the emergency department: ECG: RS at 75lpm. PR 160ms. Narrow QRS at 60 bpm. QS in V1-2. Negative T wave in V5-6. Low voltages in limb leads. No changes in serial ECG. Urgent CBC: glucose 263 mg/dL; urea 39 mg/dL; creatinine 0.55 mg/dL; sodium 140 mEq/L; K+ 4.0 mEq/L; haemoglobin 14.8 g/dL; haematocrit 42.5%; MCV 89.3 fL; platelets 217.0 10e3/uL; leucocytes 8.47 10e3/uL; INR 1.03; NT-proBNP 4806.0 pg/ mL; serial cardiac enzymes CK 1 247.0; CKMB 1 12.0; troponin T 1: 163.0 pg/ml; CK 2 226.0; CKMB 2 12.0; troponin T 2 168.0 pg/ml; Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. Congestive hilae. Minimal alveolar infiltrates in lung bases.  Complementary examinations in hospital: Echocardiography: left ventricle of reduced internal dimensions. Concentric hypertrophy. LVEF of 55-60%. Pseudonormal mitral filling pattern. Reduced mitral annulus velocities by DTI that together with a global strain (2D) suggests a study compatible with infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Mild infero-posterior hypokinesia and basal septum. Non-dilated right ventricle with mild hypertrophy and preserved contractility. Dilated left atrium. Normal sized right atrium. Mild mitral insufficiency - mild tricuspid insufficiency allowing an estimated PSAP of 55-60 mmHg. Slightly thickened aortic valve with normal dynamics. Normal pulmonary valve. Inferior vena cava 19 mm with absence of inspiratory collapse. Global pericardial effusion of severe posterolateral predominance. Phasic respiratory filling changes in atrioventricular patterns. Partial collapse of the right atrium. Conclusion: study suggestive of infiltrative cardiomyopathy. LVH with LVEF 55-60%. Severe pericardial effusion. Moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension. ECG: sinus pause with nodal escape rhythm at 40 bpm with narrow QRS, low voltage in frontal leads with flattened repolarisation. Cardiac MRI: biventricular concentric hypertrophy with normal volumes and no contractility alterations. Preserved biventricular systolic function. Severe dilatation of the LA. Diffuse pericardial effusion up to 24 mm thick, lateral to the LV, without haemodynamic repercussions. After administration of gadolinium, there was no adequate suppression of the myocardial signal; it was suboptimally suppressed with T1 at 160 ms (lower than usual in healthy patients) and then there was diffuse patchy mesocardial enhancement in both ventricles. These findings are suggestive of infiltrative cardiomyopathy, including amyloid cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography: right femoral access. Coronary arteries without significant lesions. Direct Coomb test: negative. Negative irregular antibodies. Thyroid hormones: T4L: 1.11 ng/dl, TSH: 0.756 IUI/ml. Bone marrow aspirate: normocellular marrow. Megakaryocytes present, normal in number and morphology. Infiltration by 23% of small-sized atypical plasma cells with eccentric nucleus without visible nucleolus, moderate cytoplasm without inclusions. No atypical cells are observed in SP. Flow cytometry: CMF 4.37% of the total number of MO cells. Of these, 96.0% show an aberrant/pathological phenotype CD45+weak CD38++ CD138+ CD138+ CD56+ CD27+- weak CD28+ CD19- CD20- CD117+ and monoclonal IgCit of Kappa type, no expression of IgG, IgA or IgM heavy chains is detected, a phenotype compatible with plasma cell dyscrasia of the Kappa light chain secreting myeloma type. Quantification of immunoglobulins: IgG: 693, IgA: 199, IgM: 28, IgD: <23.IEF in blood: Bence-Jones Kappa protein. Free Kappa chains in serum: 1110 mgr/l, free Lambda chains in serum: 34.6 mg/l. Kappa/Lambda ratio: 32. Urine FEF: Bence-Jones positive. Bence-Jones Kappa protein. Free chains Kappa urine 24 hours 222 mg, free chains Lambda urine 24 hours 4.77. ANOE S: anti-parietal G-cell antibodies: positive 1/640. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies negative. Gastric ATPase positive. ANCAS negative. Oncological bone series: lytic lesions in the skull. Virus serology: HBV negative, HCV negative, CMV: IgG positive. Weak positive IgM. Cardiac biopsy: macroscopic description: five muscle fragments of 0.2- 0.3 cm. Microscopic description: endomyocardial biopsy fragments showing an acellular interstitial deposit atrophying myocytes, sometimes also around vessels in a cracked form. The deposit stains faintly for Masson, not deep blue in areas somewhat purplish. In the posterior slice for Congo-red the sample is very poorly represented and in polarised light only occasionally appears to refract in apple green, which given the clinical data, the pattern with haematoxylin eosin and Masson's technique, although not conclusive, is highly suggestive of amyloidosis. No iron deposition is identified with Perls technique and no glycogen deposition with Pas. In other focal areas myocytes show mild hypertrophy changes and little chronic non-specific inflammation.  EVOLUTION Evolution in the emergency department: the clinical picture appears to be the first episode of decompensated heart failure, with characteristic elevation of myocardial enzymes (which do not present a curve in their serialisation), marked elevation of Pro-BNP and ECG showing low voltages in the limb leads. All this suggests possible infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Evolution on the Cardiology ward: the patient was admitted to Cardiology for treatment of heart failure and study of possible infiltrative cardiomyopathy. As it was impossible to rule out acute coronary syndrome, treatment was started with ASA 100 mg a day and clopidogrel 75 mg a day, ACE inhibitors (ramipril 2.5 mg a day) and beta-blockers (bisoprolol 2.5 mg a day). Complementary tests were performed to complete the study. Forty-eight hours after starting treatment, he suffered an episode of dizziness and general malaise. With BP 90/45 mmHg, HR: 39. Sweating, mucocutaneous pallor and distal coldness. AC: arrhythmic, bradycardic. ECG was performed. The patient was transferred to the ICU and after discontinuation of beta-blockers and once reversible acute process had been ruled out, it was decided to implant a permanent pacemaker in DDD mode. 48 hours after pacemaker implantation, the patient suffered cardiorespiratory arrest in the context of ventricular tachycardia that degenerated into ventricular fibrillation, which ended after defibrillation with 150J. Again in the ICU, the MP was questioned and VT spells were observed before the episode of VF. Finally, it was decided to implant an ICD for secondary prevention.  DIAGNOSIS A diagnosis of Kappa BJ K+ ISS:1 stage IIIA light chain multiple myeloma with primary amyloidosis (AL) with cardiac involvement and Mayo Clinic prognostic stage III (score value: 2) was finally made. Treatment was started with velcade-dexamethasone, associated with treatment of heart failure, with excellent tolerance and clinical improvement. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 79-year-old woman, with no known drug allergies, hypertensive on treatment with olmesartan 40 mg and amlodipine 5 mg per day and independent for ABVD. She presented with oppressive chest pain at rest, not radiating or associated with vegetative cortex, of three days' evolution, accompanied by an increase in her usual dyspnoea until it became minimal effort. On examination she was normotensive and afebrile with preserved vesicular murmur and no pathological sounds, rhythmic and without murmurs. There is no oedema. The neurological and abdominal examination was unremarkable. The ECG showed sinus rhythm, with ST-segment depression in V2-V6, DI and aVL (maximum 2 mm in V2), which partially corrected after becoming asymptomatic (figure 1). First enzyme measurement: ultrasensitive troponin T 1890 ng/L [0-14], CK 319 U/L [26-167]. Treatment was started with double antiplatelet therapy (ASA and clopidogrel), low molecular weight heparin, atorvastatin, candesartan and bisoprolol. The patient was admitted to the cardiology department with a diagnosis of STEMI.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: glucose 98 mg/dl; urea 60 mg/dl, creatinine 1.71 mg/dl; GFR 31 ml/min; sodium 140 mmol/l; potassium 4.7 mmol/l, CK 319 U/L [26-167]; ultrasensitive troponin T 1890 ng/L [0-14]; leukocytes 9.95x103; neutrophils 5.92x103 (59.4%); lymphocytes 1.38x103 (19.9%); monocytes 1.01x103 (10.2%); eosinophils 1.63x103 (16.4%) [normal 0-6], basophils 0.01x103 (0.1%) Hb 12.5 g/dl; Hto 38.9%; MCV81.7 fl; platelets 61 x 103; leukocytes and eosinophils were as high as 20.950 and 46% respectively. Chest X-ray: CTI< 0.5, no infiltrates. C costophrenic sinuses were free. Echocardiography: LV not dilated, with slightly depressed systolic function and no contractility alterations. Right chambers not dilated with normal systolic function. LA dilated. Impaired relaxation. Mild MI and TR. Coronary angiography: right dominance. Coronary arteries without significant lesions. Cardiac MR and viability: non-dilated LV with slightly depressed LVEF (50%). Apparent thickening of the wall without being able to specify whether it corresponds to cardiac muscle, which is more significant in the lateral wall, with a maximum end-diastolic thickness of 18 mm. In the early study after intravenous gadolinium administration, an area of hyperenhancement was observed in the lower basal segment and hypocaptive foci of subendocardial location on the lateral wall, which could correspond to small thrombi. Dilated LA. Mild MI and TR. Cerebral MRI: multiple ischaemic lesions affecting both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. No images suggestive of intraparenchymal bleeding. The ventricular system is symmetrical and of normal calibre. Parasites in stool: negative. Determination of IgE: negative: ECA: 40; ANA negative Hep-2: 1/320; ANCA IFI positive. P-ANCA and c-ANCA negative. Tumour markers: CA 125: 40 [0-35]; Beta-2-microglobulin 3494 [1200-2500]; CYFRA 21-1: 4.4 (0-3.3) IF plasma/orine: absence of monoclonal peaks. ACS. Antiphospholipids: negative. Bone marrow aspirate: flow cytometry: MO with 19% lymphocytes, of which 73% are T lymphocytes and 16% are B lymphocytes. A TCR Beta sequencing study was performed and no clonal population was identified. Cytogenetics: absence of FIP1L/PDGFRRa and PDGFRb mutations. Helminth serology: Strongyloides, Toxocara, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Fasciola negative. Electroencephalogram: marked destructuring and global slowing of brain activity. These findings indicate the existence of moderate to severe diffuse encephalic involvement. Thoracoabdominal CT: no pulmonary thromboembolism was identified in the main lobar or segmental arteries. Bronchiectasis of the anterior segment of the LSI. Discrete thickening of the subpleural interstitium. Two right apical perilymphatic nodules of 4mm are identified, probably corresponding to intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Global cardiomegaly associated with myocardial thickening in the left ventricle up to 21 mm in its lateral aspect. Minimal bilateral laminar pleural effusion. 10 mm prevascular adenopathy with no evidence of other significant mediastinal adenopathy. No significant retroperitoneal adenopathy. Normal liver. Bilateral cortical renal cysts. Uncomplicated digmoid diverticulosis.  EVOLUTION On admission, coronary angiography showed coronary arteries without lesions. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a non-dilated LV with slightly depressed LVEF (51%). Dilated LA. Impaired relaxation. Mild MI and TR. Due to persistent eosinophilia (16-45%) it was decided to request cardiac MRI which was compatible with eosinophilic cardiomyopathy. Ten days after admission the patient had a stroke with left hemiplegia and decreased level of consciousness. Brain MRI showed multiple infarcts in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. Doppler ultrasound of the supra-aortic trunks was normal. A study of hypereosinophilic syndrome was initiated: ANA 1/320; ANCA (+) IFI; no paraproteins were detected in blood or urine. Bone marrow aspirate ruled out eosinophilic leukaemia. Parasitological stool culture was also negative and IgE values were within normal range. Corticotherapy was started with prednisone 60 mg/day (1 mg/kg/day). Given the persistence of hypereosinophilia with systemic repercussions (cardiac and CNS), treatment was started with bolus methylprednisolone, without response or neurological improvement. Treatment was started with imatinib while awaiting the results of FIP1L/PDGFRa, obtaining a transitory decrease in the levels of eosinophils in the blood. Imatinib was discontinued after a further increase in eosinophils and hydroxyurea was started. He also presented with a polymicrobial infection of a decubitus ulcer, isolating SAMS. A month and a half after admission, he presented with abundant rectorrhagia, for which 2 red blood cell concentrates were transfused and due to the clinical situation it was decided not to perform a colonoscopy. After 48 hours he presented a new episode of rectorrhagia together with a worsening of his general and neurological condition. In consensus with the family, it was decided to start perfusion sedoanalgesia, and the patient died a few days later.

Background Female, 51 years old. Arterial hypertension. Chronic glaucoma. No known allergies. No toxic habits. On treatment with telmisartan 80 mg/day. Baseline situation: active. Independent for activities of daily living. Dyspnoea on moderate exertion (NHYA II).  Current illness She visits her family doctor for moderate dyspnoea of about 3 months of evolution. Since then she has also presented oedema in the lower limbs. She reported no previous history of chest pain or palpitations. A chest X-ray was performed and in view of the presence of cardiomegaly, preferential assessment in the outpatient cardiology department was requested.  Physical examination BP: 130/90 mmHg HR: 77 bpm SatO2: 98% Head and neck normal. No IY CA: rhythmic, holosystolic murmur II/VI with R2 splitting AP: VCM in both lung fields Abdomen: nondescript LES: oedema with perimalleolar fovea  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 75 bpm with signs of AD growth, normal PR, wide QRS (150 msec) with morphology of complete right bundle branch block and secondary repolarisation alterations. Echocardiography: severe dilatation of right chambers. Apical displacement of the insertion point of the tricuspid septal leaflet (about 2.5 cm with respect to the plane of the mitral annulus). Massive TR due to lack of leaflet coaptation. Assessment of RV systolic function is difficult but appears to be severely depressed. The pulmonary trunk is of normal size. The pulmonary valve has no abnormalities. The left chambers are small in size and displaced by the right chambers. LV systolic function is visually at the lower limit of normal. The left valves are normal. Mitral filling pattern of impaired relaxation. No ASD (although assessment is difficult), no other shunts. Normal aortic arch. Slight systemic venous congestion.  EVOLUTION Furosemide 40 mg/day was added to the treatment, and cardiac magnetic resonance was requested for anatomical characterisation and better assessment of RV function. At the 6-month check-up, the patient was asymptomatic. The result of the cardiac MRI was brought in: a study of very poor technical quality (movement artefacts). Dilatation of the right chambers, with apical displacement of the tricuspid leaflets, which do not coapt. Free tricuspid regurgitation. RVEF 43%. No associated malformations are seen. Left ventricle displaced by the right, with preserved ventricular function. Given the improvement in symptoms, it was decided to maintain medical treatment and outpatient monitoring at 6 months with new echocardiography, new MRI and cardiopulmonary stress test.  DIAGNOSIS Mild heart failure on debut Ebstein's anomaly Severe tricuspid regurgitation and mild RV systolic dysfunction |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is 55 years old, with no known drug allergies and no known cardiovascular risk factors.  Personal history ʟʟ Previous heart disease: dilated cardiomyopathy due to Chagas disease with severe systolic dysfunction and implantation of a single-chamber ICD in 2007 for primary prevention. Regular follow-up in the arrhythmia unit of our department (during follow-up he presented an episode of SMVT that subsided with ATP, without requiring shock). On 24 March 2015 he was admitted to our department for ICD generator replacement.  Other history: sensory, axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy of moderate degree in the upper and lower extremities.  Chronic treatment: ramipril 5 mg/24 hours. carvedilol 25 mg/24 hours. Sintrom according to guideline. Present illness Patient referred to the emergency department of his reference hospital after being found at home disoriented, confused and with sphincter incontinence by his work colleagues. They went to look for him as he had not been at work for the last three days. Anamnesis impossible to perform on the patient due to his neurological deterioration.  Physical examination BP: 85/60 mmHg. HR: 85 bpm. RR: 26 rpm. Sat02: 96% with nasal goggles at 2 bpm. NRL: conscious and oriented in space and person. Lethargic. Fluent language without aphasic components. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive. Left facial paresis. Cranial nerves centred. Preserved strength and sensibility in extremities. Preserved ROTs. CA: very muffled cardiac tones, no murmurs. AP: rhonchi in both lung fields. No other superimposed sounds. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation. No masses or megaliths. No signs of peritoneal irritation. MMII: No oedema. Pulses preserved. General: pterygium over the right eye. Ulcer in the wound of the ICD generator in the left subclavian region.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS In the emergency department of the hospital, the study began with the extraction of blood cultures due to fever (38.5 °C), and the following complementary tests were performed: CBC: 9000 platelets, 14,400 leukocytes, INR 10, AP 6.5%, CRP 67.11, procalcitonin 24.4, creatinine 1.77, total bilirubin 6.2 (at the expense of direct). Chest X-ray: increased CTI, hilar congestion with bilateral nodular images. Cranial CT: hypodensity in right basal ganglia compatible with old lacunar infarcts. Hypodensity in the left parietal convexity compatible with residual ischaemic lesion. No LOES, contusion images or haemorrhage. Ventricular system within normality. Thoracic-abdominal CT scan: in the mediastinum there were small lymph nodes smaller than 1 cm of doubtful pathological significance. Poorly defined nodular densities can be seen in the lung fields. Although cavitation is not seen, in the clinical context of the patient, the possibility of septic emboli should be considered. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Minimal right pleural effusion/enlargement. Abdomen: normal sized liver with no evidence of focal lesions. Bile duct, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and adrenal glands without significant findings. No free fluid or collections were seen. In view of these findings and with clinical suspicion of severe septic shock, noradrenaline perfusion and empirical antibiotic treatment with imipenem and cloxacillin was started, with poor clinical evolution, and the patient was referred to the ICU of our hospital.  On arrival at the ICU, the following tests were performed: CBC: sodium 135, K+ 4.5, Cl 101, glucose 187, urea 107, creatinine 1.28, CPK 109, total bilirubin 6.19 (direct 5.86, indirect 0.33), CRP 26, procalcitonin 17.3, Hb 13.1 g/dl, Hto 37.2%, 9000 platelets, 14850 leukocytes, INR 1.53, AP 52%. ECG: RS at 75 bpm. PR 200msg, QRS 80msg with normal axis and low voltages in frontal leads. No acute repolarisation alterations. Transthoracic echocardiography: dilated LV with apical aneurysm and hypokinesia of the remaining segments, causing moderate-severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 38%). Trivalve aortic valve, without gradients or pathological flows. Mitral valve with mild central insufficiency. Right chambers of normal dimensions with normal systolic function. LAD cable with abundant hyperechogenic material adhered along its trajectory, with independent movement suggestive of vegetation. Transesophageal echocardiogram: This study confirmed the previous findings. During his stay in the ICU, antibiotic treatment with daptomycin was continued, new blood cultures were taken and the device was removed (generator and ICD cable, by traction) after 48 hours, and samples were sent to Microbiology: Blood cultures (x2): isolation of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (resistant to cloxacillin and penicillin). LAD cable: isolation of methicillin-resistant S. aureus.  EVOLUTION In view of these findings, he was assessed by the Infectious Diseases Department, and the positive blood cultures persisted. Antibiotic treatment was adjusted and he was finally placed on vancomycin, fosfomycin and linezolid. In the following days, a repeat chest CT scan confirmed the presence of septic pulmonary emboli, bilateral pleural effusion and associated compressive atelectasis. And the transesophageal echocardiogram was repeated, which showed a mass attached to the posterior tricuspid leaflet measuring 33x18 mm, hypermobile and with anchorage that progressed to the subvalvular apparatus, with another smaller vegetation on the free edge of the septal leaflet. No pulmonary, mitral or aortic valve involvement. Antibiotic treatment was continued in the following weeks, with progressive normalisation of renal and hepatic function parameters, coagulation and inflammatory markers. Cardiac MRI was requested, which confirmed biventricular dilatation with moderate systolic dysfunction and the presence of an apical aneurysm. A new chest CT scan showed resolution of the septic embolisms; and the various echocardiographies performed showed no persistent valve vegetation. Once antibiotic treatment was completed, and the patient remained clinically stable, a new single-chamber ICD was implanted on the contralateral side without incident.  DIAGNOSIS Severe septic shock secondary to infective endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Dilated cardiomyopathy of chagasic aetiology. Severe systolic dysfunction.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 31-year-old male patient from Spain, with a history of anxiety disorder, no other pathological history of interest, no known allergies. No current treatment. He came for consultation due to exertional dyspnoea, presyncopal episodes and anxiety symptoms. She was referred to haematology due to an increase in eosinophils in the haemogram.  Examination revealed: Conscious, oriented, alert. Normal language. Normal cranial nerves. Rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Bladder murmur preserved without aggregate noises. With palpable splenomegaly 6 centimetres below the left costal ridge. No oedema in the lower limbs. Normal peripheral pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS The analysis showed an increase in eosinophil values. With suspicion of hypereosinophilic syndrome, a new blood test and extension study were requested. Absence of parasitic infection, allergy or pulmonary disease justifying the eosinophilia. Laboratory tests: leucocytes 3.8x10e3/uL (3.5-12), haemoglobin 11.9 g/dl (13.5-17.2), platelets 196x10e3/uL. Creatinine 1.32 mg/dl. Peripheral eosinophilia of 5000 elements/mmc. Troponin 0.020 ng/ml (0-0.056). Genetic study: 4q12 deletion associated with FIP1L1-PDFGFRA rearrangement. Echocardiogram: with signs of endomyocardial infiltration. ECG: sinus rhythm at 56 bpm, narrow QRS of normal configuration, 60o axis and transition in V3. Universal negative T waves. Abdominal ultrasound: homogeneous splenomegaly of 17.5 cm. Thoracic CT scan: no pulmonary infiltrates. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 1 (MRI 1): restrictive pattern in the right cavities (small ventricle, preserved ejection fraction, atrial dilatation) with apical myocardial fibrosis. Transmural fibrosis in the mid-apical inferolateral wall of the left ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 2 (MRI 2): two hypointense images of crescentic morphology are observed in the apex that could correspond to thrombi. Late enhancement with areas of signal hyperintensity of the RV apex and inferior aspect of the LV apex that have not changed with respect to the previous description. Findings of hypereosinophilia with biventricular restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 3 (MRI 3): control. Morphological abnormalities previously described FE 59%, hypointense areas are observed in the apex of both ventricles of linear morphology that probably correspond to fibrosis raising the differential diagnosis with laminar thrombus.  EVOLUTION Treatment was started with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily, well tolerated and with a rapid haematological response that allowed a dose reduction to 100 mg daily after 2 months. A control ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed the absence of splenomegaly. Symptom improvement. Subsequently, arterial hypertension was diagnosed. We started treatment with bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily, which we had to discontinue due to intense asthenia. We replaced bisoprolol with olmesartan 10 mg daily with good tolerance and good control. Studies for secondary causes were negative. Cardiac MRI was requested where a restrictive pattern was observed as described in the complementary tests (MRI 1). In the control cardiac MRI (MRI 2) performed at 12 months, we detected images of crescentic morphology at the level of the apex. The images offer a reasonable doubt between laminar thrombi at the apical level versus artefacts. In favour of thrombi is the fact that they are located over the areas of fibrosis detected in the MRI and the high thrombogenicity of this disease, although the fact that they appear in both ventricles suggests that it could also be an artefact. Echocardiography showed no evidence of intracavitary thrombus. We explained the situation to the patient and decided to start anticoagulation with sintrom, which we again had to suspend due to intense asthenia and osteomuscular pain. We raised the possibility of starting treatment with rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, for off-label use. After explaining to the patient that this is not an indication studied in clinical trials or approved by the Ministry, we decided to treat the patient jointly; in the controls he presented good tolerance and disappearance of the symptoms attributed to the synthroid. In the control MRI (MRI 3), after 3 months of anticoagulation, the same images continue to appear, which are not present in the echocardiography. However, given that thrombotic phenomena appear in up to 25% of cases and that the current indications for anticoagulation contemplate starting treatment when thrombosis has already occurred, we decided to maintain treatment, even with an off-label drug.  DIAGNOSIS Myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia associated with FIP1L1- PDGFR rearrangement. Restrictive cardiomyopathy with apical and inferolateral LV and apical RV myocardial fibrosis. Probable LV apex thrombi in hypersosinophilic syndrome Essential arterial hypertension. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Personal history Patient aged 49, baker by profession. Cardiovascular risk factors: smoker of more than 25 pack-years, obese and moderate drinker. No HBP, DM, LBP or other history of interest. No cardiological history. No other diseases of interest or chronic treatments. Current illness Consultation in the emergency department for 10 days of progressive dyspnoea, reaching minimal effort, with orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He denies precordial pain, palpitations, syncope, fever or infectious symptoms at another level.   Physical examination BP: 128/90. HR: 105. SatO2: 92%. Afebrile, PVC 15 with mild RHY. BMI of 34. AC: arrhythmic RsCs at 110 bpm, no murmurs. AP: bibasal crackles. Abdomen globular, without free fluid or megaliths. LES: oedema with fovea in the lower 1⁄2⁄2. Peripheral pulses present and symmetrical. No carotid, abdominal or femoral murmurs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood count, biochemistry and coagulation: normal. Myocardial damage markers: HbA1c, TSH, cholesterol normal. Blood gases on admission: hypoxaemia and hypercapnia (pO2 60, pCO2 47 and bicarbonate 26). Chest X-ray: compatible with heart failure. ECG: rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) on admission, unknown. Echocardiogram: LA moderately dilated. RA slightly dilated. LV slightly dilated and hypertrophic, with global hypocontractility and moderately depressed global systolic function. EF 35-40%. RV with impaired function due to TAPSE, mild TR, estimated PSAP of 26mmHG +PVC. MV with good opening and mild reflux. AO normofunctioning. Dilated vena cava with partial collapse. No pericardial effusion. Moderate biventricular dysfunction with slightly dilated and hypertrophic vi with LVEF 35-40%. Coronary angiography: coronary arteries without significant coronary lesions.  EVOLUTION The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of decompensated heart failure due to unknown rapid atrial fibrillation. Dilatation and moderate biventricular dysfunction were observed. When ischaemic origin was ruled out by coronary angiography, it was attributed as possibly secondary to tachycardiomyopathy or alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy. During admission, telemetry showed a spontaneous pause of 12 seconds coinciding with sleep apnoea, leaving the patient's own rhythm with narrow QRS. The patient was questioned about sleep habits and, with a high suspicion of sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (SAOS), a consultation with Pneumology was requested. The patient was diagnosed with COPD GOLD II and severe OSAHS. An outpatient polysomnography also revealed severe associated oxygen desaturation. Prior to admission, the patient was "apparently healthy". Special emphasis is placed on the importance of hygienic dietary measures, which together with CPAP, will be the most important treatment in this case, more than any pharmacological treatment. The patient commits to a change in lifestyle and anticoagulation is started in order to programme electrical cardioversion of AF. Follow-up after 3 months: an effective electrical cardioversion is performed, with the patient going into sinus rhythm and AF therefore becoming persistent. Control echocardiogram after 3 months (in sinus rhythm, without alcohol consumption, with BMI 33.3 and CPAP treatment): non-dilated ventricle with preserved LVEF. It is therefore a reversible ventricular dysfunction. We cannot say whether the dysfunction was secondary to rapid AF, alcohol or even to severe OSAHS itself.  DIAGNOSIS First episode of heart failure. Atrial fibrillation. Effective electrical cardioversion. moderate biventricular isfunction. Tachycardiomyopathy. Severe sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (SAOS). COPD GOLD II type. Smoking. Obesity. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Preserved higher functions.  Current illness She came to the emergency department for 24 hours of progressive dyspnoea until she became resting, together with palpitations and intermittent episodes of oppressive, non-radiating precordial pain, without vegetative cortex and self-limited in a few minutes. She did not report oliguria or oedema in the previous days.  Physical examination BP: 136/84mmHg. HR: 124lpm; SatO2 with O2 at 3L: 95%. Afebrile. Conscious and oriented. Impression of gravity. Prostrate and sweating, but with good peripheral perfusion. Tachypnoea at 26 rpm at rest. Head and neck: no jugular plethora.

Abdomen: soft, not painful on palpation, without signs of peritonism. Bowel sounds present. Extremities: no oedema or signs of DVT. Femoral and pedial pulses present.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus tachycardia at 114 bpm, QRS axis at 0o. Symmetrical negative T waves in III and avF. Chest X-ray: bilateral alveolar infiltrates, predominantly perihilar, more marked in the right hemithorax. Pinching of both costophrenic sinuses. Blood tests: arterial blood gases: pO2 64mmHg, pCO2 32 mmHg, pH 7.27, HCO3 18. Biochemistry: glucose 142mg/dL, urea 110 mg/dL, creatinine 0.96 mg/dL, albumin 3.56 g/dL, CK 159 U/L, ultrasensitive TnT 418. GPT 63 U/l. Na 142 mmol/L, K 4.7 mmol/L. Haemocytometry: Hb 12.6 g/dL, MCV 93 fL, Hcto 31.9%. Platelets 170,000. Leukocytes 12,100 (82% polymoronuclear). Coagulation: Prothrombin index 72%, INR 1.15, activated partial thromboplastin time 38 sec. Angio-CT of pulmonary arteries: no repletion defects in pulmonary arteries and their branches suggestive of PTE. Aorta of normal calibre and morphology along its thoracic course. Extensive alveolar infiltrates in the right upper lobe and middle lobe. Bilateral pleural effusion, larger in the right hemithorax. Signs of right heart failure with contrast reflux to the inferior cava and suprahepatic arteries, and rectification of the interventricular septum. Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV not dilated or hypertrophic, with hypokinesia of mediobasal segments of inferior and posterior (inferolateral) face and good global and segmental systolic function. Trivalve aortic valve, normofunctioning. Prolapse of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve due to rupture of the chordae tendineae, causing a massive eccentric mitral flail directed towards the interatrial septum. Non-dilated left atrium. Non-dilated RV with moderate dysfunction. No pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography: the common trunk shows mild atheromatosis. The anterior descending artery shows diffuse irregularities with a moderate lesion in the middle segment affecting the origin of the first diagonal, with moderate stenosis. The circumflex artery is of medium development, destined to two obtuse marginal branches with mild atheromatosis, without significant lesions. The right coronary artery is the dominant vessel, of great development. In its middle segment there is a very angulated lesion with severe stenosis. Good distal bed.  EVOLUTION The patient was assessed in the emergency department and was found to have acute pulmonary oedema with haemodynamic stability initially. Echocardioscopy performed in the emergency department revealed severe mitral insufficiency due to posterior mitral prolapse and possible rupture of the chordae tendineae, so it was decided to transfer her to the coronary care unit, while Cardiac Surgery on duty was contacted to assess urgent surgery, and the haemodynamicist on duty to perform coronary angiography, with the findings described above. On arrival at the coronary unit, oxygen therapy was administered with 100% oxygen reservoir, intravenous diuretic and low-dose ACE inhibitors, despite which he continued to worsen both from the respiratory and haemodynamic point of view, and was admitted to the operating theatre as an emergency patient. Under extracorporeal circulation, aortocoronary saphenous bypass is performed to the middle right coronary artery, with good vessel quality. Subsequently, access was gained to the left atrium, where a rupture of a chordae tendineae was observed at the level of the head of one belly of the posteromedial papillary muscle and a moderately unstructured mitral valve, for which reason it was decided to replace the mitral valve, implanting a biological prosthesis of no. 27. The patient was transferred back to the coronary unit. In the postoperative evolution, the patient presented severe pump failure in the first hours, requiring, in addition to inotropic support, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, which could be removed after 24 hours, with subsequent haemodynamic stabilisation. He also presented complete atrioventricular block, recovered in less than 48 hours, and perioperative atrial fibrillation, which was managed with a course of intravenous amiodarone. Once on the hospital ward, he presented septic symptoms of probable respiratory origin, requiring prolonged treatment with intravenous meropenem and vancomycin for 3 weeks. After a prolonged admission with slow physical rehabilitation due to the significant loss of muscle mass, the patient was finally discharged from hospital, with monitoring by Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.

Right ventricle at the high limit of normality (VTDVD 92 ml/m2; VTSVD 49 ml/m2) with mild depression of right ventricular function. Flattening of the interventricular septum. Very dilated atria (left atrium 43 cm2; right atrium 36 cm2). Tubular portion of ascending aorta dilated. Pulmonary trunk and both branches dilated (pulmonary trunk 36 mm, left pulmonary artery 23 mm and right pulmonary artery 33 mm). Dilated inferior vena cava (26 mm) without inspiratory collapse. Dilated left main trunk. Anterior descending artery of normal size. Circumflex artery with large dilatation along its entire length (10-14 mm) and saccular aneurysm in the distal portion of 3.5 cm in diameter with drainage into the coronary sinus. No communication with pulmonary vessels was observed. Coronography: large aneurysmal dilatation of the left coronary trunk from the origin that continues with the circumflex artery very aneurysmal and with great tortuosity. Large aneurysm dependent on the marginal branch. The circumflex artery flows into the right coronary artery through the very dilated coronary sinus. Rest of coronary arteries without findings. Multislice CT angiography: dilatation of the circumflex artery with saccular aneurysm in its distal portion and drainage in the coronary sinus.  Clinical evolution Diuretic treatment and poor tolerance to vasodilator and beta-blocker treatment, so initial management was restricted to intravenous diuretic infusion with oral potassium and oral ACE inhibitors, as well as anticoagulation. The patient had symptoms of dizziness and significant asthenia, which made it necessary to start beta-blockers progressively, starting with minimal doses, and finally achieving good tolerance. She presented several episodes of atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 170 bpm symptomatic with clinical dyspnoea and non-specific dizziness, but with good haemodynamic response, which meant that, given the poor initial tolerance of the beta-blockers, digoxin had to be associated, despite the renal failure, with correct control of renal function, which did not worsen. Finally, significant improvement in congestive symptoms was achieved with diuretics, heart rate control with digoxin and beta-blockers, as well as control of blood pressure. After performing the complementary examinations, the therapeutic possibilities for the patient were discussed in a joint cardiology and cardiovascular surgery session, presenting a surgical risk of 15.9% according to the logistic score. After proposing surgery to the patient and her relatives, given the patient's age and current situation, with significant clinical improvement, they decided on an initially conservative management, considering the surgical option at a later stage if the patient worsened again at home. After 12 days in the cardiology ward, the patient was discharged home with diuretic treatment, beta-blocker, digoxin for three days a week, anticoagulation and antihypertensive treatment. The patient was seen in outpatient clinics and was clinically stable with no new episodes of heart failure. Three months after discharge, while at home, she presented an episode of sudden death that triggered the patient's death, the origin of this event being unknown.  Diagnosis Debut of heart failure. Symptomatic left coronary fistula in an elderly patient of probable congenital origin. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

History, current illness and physical examination  History No known drug allergies. Risk factors: diabetes mellitus 2, hypertension, dyslipidaemia. Ex-smoker for 7 years of 50 packs/year. Medical history: COPD. Ischaemic stroke of middle cerebral artery in March 2008. Surgical interventions: haemorrhoids, epigastric hernia, colonic polypectomy. Bladder tumour treated with TUR in 2011 and 2013. Previous heart disease: dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 2002 with severely depressed systolic function (LVEF 20%), and normal coronary arteries in cardiac catheterisation. Follow-up in cardiology outpatient clinics, with significant improvement in ventricular function with medical treatment (LVEF 50% in echocardiograms in 2008, 2010 and 2012). In November 2013, she presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, electrical cardioversion was performed in the emergency department, which was effective and she was discharged. A week later, he returned to the emergency department for atrial fibrillation, where electrical cardioversion was again performed, and he was discharged to sinus rhythm. On review at the outpatient clinic in January 2014, the patient was again in atrial fibrillation.  Usual treatment: dabigatran 110 mg/12h, bisoprolol 10 mg/24h, ramipril 2.5 mg/24h, rosuvastatin 20 mg/24h, omeprazole 40 mg/24h, furosemide 20 mg/12h (administered as needed), inhaled tiotropium bromide, repaglinide 0.5 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg, alprazolam 0.5 mg/24h.  Present illness: 75-year-old male patient referred to the emergency department from the cardiology outpatient department for presenting significant clinical deterioration in recent weeks, with dyspnoea on minimal exertion, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, and palpitations in recent days. He did not report any respiratory infection or other accompanying symptoms. On admission, he presented atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 130-150 bpm despite treatment with maximum doses of beta-blockers, so he was referred for admission to cardiology to attempt rate control or cardioversion.  Physical examination BP 120/65 mmHg. HR 155 bpm, Ta 36.5 oC. O2 Sat. O2 96% with FiO2 of 0.21. Patient conscious, normal colour and normohydrated. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic cardiac tones, without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: generalised decrease in vesicular murmur, with bibasal crackles. lower limbs: no oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis. Abdomen: soft, not painful on palpation.  Additional tests ECG: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, narrow QRS, no intraventricular conduction disturbances. Signs of left ventricular overload in V5-V6 and DI and aVL. Chest X-ray: bibasal alveolar interstitial infiltrates suggestive of heart failure. Free costophrenic sinuses. Cardiothoracic index less than 0.5. Blood tests carried out on the cardiology ward: ʟʟ Leucocytes: 12.4x10e9/L, Hb17.5 g/dl, platelets 262x10e9/L. Coagulation: PTT 15s, IQ: 76%, APTT 35.3s. Glucose: 140 mg/dl, urea 64 mg/dl, creatinine 1.21 mg/dl, K 5 MM/L, Na 143 MM/L, AST 31 U/L, ALT 41 MM/L, LDH 244 U/L, CRP 0.2 mg/dl, pro-BNP 16727 pg/ml. Glycosylated haemoglobin: 6.9%.

Moderately dilated left atrium. Mitral valve thickened, with mild insufficiency. Sclerosed aortic valve, with good opening, without insufficiency. Right chambers with moderately dilated atrium. Preserved RVEF. Inferior vena cava not dilated, with good inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion.  Clinical evolution The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward with atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 140-150 bpm without being able to control it despite increasing bisoprolol to a dose of 15 mg/24h and adding digoxin and amiodarone, remaining with a ventricular rate of 130-140 bpm for the following 3 days. Given the failure of rhythm control in previous episodes and difficult heart rate control, the clinical team, electrophysiologists and the family decided together to ablate the atrioventricular node and place a pacemaker. A permanent pacemaker was placed, with the intention of also placing an LV lead for cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT), but this was not possible due to coronary sinus dissection. Finally, a DDD pacemaker was placed. Five days later, atrioventricular node ablation was performed without incident. The patient was discharged with better clinical control, maintaining the same anticoagulant treatment, withdrawing digoxin, amiodarone and the very high doses of bisoprolol with which he had tried to reduce the heart rate. Medication for the management of heart failure was maintained.  Diagnosis Atrial fibrillation with difficult to control rapid ventricular response. Rate control strategy by AV node ablation and pacemaker implantation. Tachycardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: 88-year-old male with a personal history of arterial hypertension, VDD pacemaker due to complete AV block implanted 4 months ago, complicated by post-implant cardiac tamponade and recent admission to the Geriatrics Department for pneumonia in the right upper lobe. Baseline situation: independent for basic activities of daily living, without cognitive impairment. Dyspnoea on moderate exertion.  Usual treatment: enalapril 5 mg per day and torasemide 10 mg per day. Present illness: she attended the emergency department for generalised oedema and oligoanuria of three days' evolution, with intense asthenia and anorexia. She also reported catarrhal symptoms, with rhinorrhoea and dry cough, without thermometric fever. Physical examination: BP 190/80 mmHg, HR 95 bpm, temperature 37.7 oC, saturation with 2-litre nasal spectacles 94%. General condition was fair, mucocutaneous pallor, eupneic at rest. Auscultation revealed a mesosystolic murmur in the lower left sternal border and rhonchi in the right lung base. The rest was unaltered.  Complementary tests Laboratory tests: Hb 10.3 g/dl, MCV 100, creatinine 3.49 mg/dl (previously 1.4 mg/dl), Na 144, K 5.5 and moderate haematuria in the urine sediment. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, signs of pulmonary congestion and infiltrate in the right lower pulmonary lobe. ECG: sinus rhythm at 94 bpm with electrostimulated ventricular response. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle with severe concentric hypertrophy and moderate systolic dysfunction. Degenerative aortic stenosis. Non-dilated right ventricle. Normopositioned pacemaker lead, with a wart of approximately 1.8 cm2, close to the tricuspid leaflets and synchronous movement with them, with mild tricuspid insufficiency. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 31 mmHg. Slight pericardial effusion and severe left pleural effusion.  Clinical course The patient was admitted in a serious condition with intense asthenia and oligoanuria with worsening renal function. In view of the echocardiographic findings and the diagnosis of endocarditis on the pacemaker lead, antibiotic treatment with rifampicin and daptomycin was started. It was decided to remove the entire MCP system and reimplant a new device as the patient was in full AVB, but the clinical evolution was very torpid with intense negative mood symptoms and poor functional reserve, and the patient died a few days after admission without being able to remove the pacemaker.  Diagnosis We present the case of an octogenarian patient with endocarditis on a pacemaker lead with a very torpid evolution.  The postulated pathogenic mechanisms are as follows: Local contamination of the pacemaker. This is the most frequent mechanism. It usually occurs during implantation of the device. Often the infection starts in the generator pocket and spreads to the lead. The clinical course may be acute or larval, manifesting itself even years later. The duration of the procedure, inadequate asepsis and operator inexperience are responsible factors. Skin erosion or necrosis of the generator pocket or the skin adjacent to the electrode, which act as a gateway for microorganisms. Factors involved in this mechanism include inadequate technique and site of implantation, generator size, and patient malnutrition. Haematogenous infection. Arrival of the micro-organism via the blood from another distant infectious source. The source of bacteraemia may be a central venous catheter, a valve prosthesis or invasive therapeutic procedures.  The most frequently isolated microorganisms are staphylococci. S. aureus is the predominant bacterium in cases of acute infection, while coagulase-negative staphylococci are the micro-organisms responsible for the majority of late infections.  Other microorganisms involved include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteria, Propionibacterium acnes and Corynebacterium sp., and polymicrobial infections have been described, especially in diabetic patients or those taking corticosteroids. When the pacemaker infection is secondary to left-sided endocarditis, the microbiological profile is different, in line with the microorganisms causing the valve infection. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
History, current illness and physical examination A 79-year-old woman under follow-up for frequent palpitations without associated structural heart disease, who was referred for an electrophysiological study and possible ablation of atrial tachycardia. She had a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Physical examination was normal. The echocardiogram showed a non-dilated left ventricle with preserved LVEF and no significant valvular abnormalities. In a Holter study, there were episodes of non-sustained atrial tachycardia. The usual laboratory tests were normal and the chest X-ray showed no evidence of pleuropulmonary disease or significant alterations in the cardiopericardial silhouette. He was on antiarrhythmic treatment with atenolol 50 mg/12h. Other cardiological treatment: eprosartan, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, furosemide, pitavastatin, ezetimibe.  Complementary tests Baseline electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 101 bpm. PR 173 ms, QRS: 99 ms. Left ventricular systolic overload. Non-sustained atrial tachycardia.  Clinical course Electrocatheters were introduced via femoral approach for electrophysiological studies in the RA, RV and His, in the coronary sinus, as well as an ablation catheter. Basically, non-sustained atrial tachycardia was observed with a negative P wave in the inferior face, positive in D1 and aVL. Under isoproterenol administration it becomes sustained. AH: 120 ms and HV: 48 ms. Electroanatomical mapping of the RA was performed, with greater precocity in the perihisian region. Patent foramen ovale. Retrograde aortic mapping was performed, with greater precocity in the posterior aortic sinus in the vicinity of the right aortic sinus. In this area a precocity of 39 ms is obtained with respect to the P wave. RF energy is applied with interruption of the tachycardia in the first second. Then 3 minutes of safety is applied around the area, first with 20 watts and then with 30 watts. At the end of the procedure, sinus rhythm of 75 bpm and HRBBB of mechanical aetiology was observed. There were no significant complications and the patient was discharged the day after the procedure.  Diagnosis Atrial tachycardia originating in the posterior aortic sinus region. Radiofrequency ablation of the tachycardia via retrograde aortic route with efficacy criteria. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
History, current illness and physical examination Reason for consultation: dyspnoea Personal history: No known drug allergies. Diabetes mellitus secondary to pancreatoduedectomy performed in 2005 due to a mass in the head of the pancreas with suspected ampuloma and corresponding to chronic sclerosing pancreatitis; spenectomy in the same surgical act (also cholecystectomy and appendectomy). Multicentric Castleman's disease, plasmacytic variant, diagnosed in January 2006. Initially treated with CHOP (8 cycles) with good response. Due to gastric parietal thickening, a gastroscopy was performed which revealed grade 2 oesophageal varices, without fundic varices and a biopsy of the gastric body compatible with chronic gastritis without significant atrophy. In November of the same year, due to persistent PET-CT activity, treatment was started with chlorambucil and later rituximab, which was maintained intermittently due to supra- and infradiaphragmatic metabolic progression until January 2013.

During the hospital stay, he had several episodes of palpitations, and the electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 130lpm and spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm after a strategy of ventricular rate control with beta-blockers and anticoagulation. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle slightly dilated (VTD 145 ml, VTD/SC 81mL/m2), not hypertrophied, with hypokinesia of all segments at baseline and moderate systolic dysfunction. Grade III diastolic dysfunction (mean E/e" =16, observing restrictive mitral filling pattern that pseudonormalises with respiratory movements). Estimated global LVEF moderately depressed LVEF 41%. Slightly dilated left atrium with slightly dilated aortic root and ascending aorta. Non-dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function. Mitral valve with thin leaflets without stenosis and with mild insufficiency. Trivalve aortic valve without significant stenosis or insufficiency. No tricuspid insufficiency that would allow estimation of PSAP. Inferior cava not dilated with normal inspiratory collapse. Intact interatrial septum. Minimal pericardial effusion. Bilateral pleural effusion. Whole body PET-CT fluorodeoxyglucose-F18: the images obtained still show a localised adenopathy in the left internal mammary chain, with no significant metabolic or morphological change with respect to the previous study, current maximum SUV of 1.2 (the same as the previous one). At the infradiaphragmatic level, some lymph node formations are visualised in both external iliac chains with slight metabolic detectability (SUV max around 1.8, similar to previous) and without significant variations in their size or number. An adenopathy is seen in the right obturator region with slight detectability (SUV max of 1.5) which was not visualised before. In addition, there are still innumerable nodular lesions, already seen in the previous study, in the mesentery, although with an overall decrease in their metabolism and size. The lesion previously described in the mesentery, at the right pelvic level, close to the midline, is not currently visible, which suggests a probable reactive/inflammatory nature as there is no evidence of new treatments since the last PET scan. In the localising CT scan, bilateral pleural effusion is seen, predominantly on the right, without metabolic detectability; multiple pseudonodular infiltrates are also seen, predominantly in the bases, with slight metabolic detectability. Conclusion: slight metabolic improvement with respect to the previous control of 1 year ago with persistence of detectable supra- and infradiaphragmatic metabolic lymphadenopathies with predominance of the latter location. Ergometry-SPECT: inconclusive ergometry due to not reaching submaximal heart rate (HR). Up to the load reached (5 METS) no signs of ischaemia were observed. Chronotropic incompetence. Slow HR recovery. Moderately reduced functional capacity (64% of predicted). ʟʟ Gated SPECT of myocardial perfusion is performed after ergometric stress and injection of the radiopharmaceutical at the time of maximum stress. Delayed resting study with injection of the same activity. Two-day protocol. The images obtained post-stress show a slight perfusion defect in the basal and middle segment of the inferior wall that remains with similar characteristics when the radiological attenuation correction technique is applied, improving moderately in the resting acquisition. There is also an increase in the size of the left ventricle in the post-stress study, which reaches a STV of approximately 101 ml, with global hypokinesia in the stress study, which decreases significantly at rest, also improving LVEF. In the GATED study, the following functional values were obtained post-stress/rest: LVEF 29%/52%, STV 101 mL/62 mL, TDV 142 mL/131 mL. VTD/SC 80 mL/m2 at stress and 74 mL/m2 at rest. Conclusion: findings compatible with mild-moderate and moderately extensive stress-induced lower wall ischaemia, with transient ventricular dysfunction at post-stress compared to rest as an indirect sign of severity. abdominal ultrasound: liver of normal size with homogeneous echogenicity and regular contours without evidence of focal lesions. Portal vein of normal calibre. No dilatation of the suprahepatic veins. Absence of gallbladder and spleen due to previous surgery. Retroperitoneal region not adequately assessed due to intestinal gas interposition. Both kidneys are of normal size, with preserved cortices, without dilatation of the excretory tract or images suggestive of lithiasis. No free fluid was seen in the abdominal cavity.  Clinical course Given the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, it was decided to request a diagnostic coronary angiography. The patient showed clinical improvement of heart failure with treatment. Coronary angiography: coronary arteries without significant stenosis. Ventriculography showed a slightly dilated left ventricle with moderately depressed systolic function (LVEF 38%) and global hypokinesia. Absence of mitral insufficiency. Given that the coronary angiography was normal and the possible aetiology of coronary macroagiopathy was ruled out as the cause of the ventricular dysfunction, it was decided to request an outpatient MRI to rule out infiltrative lesions probably related to Castleman's disease, the results of which are currently pending.  Diagnosis Main diagnosis at discharge: congestive heart failure with moderate systolic dysfunction and grade III diastolic dysfunction.  Secondary diagnoses: non-valvular paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. CHA2DS2-VASc Score = 2 (high embolic risk). HAS-BLED Score = 0 (low bleeding risk). Multicentric Castleman's disease. Diabetes mellitus secondary to pancreatectomy.  Treatment: salt- and fat-free diet. Daily exercise.  Medication: Pancreatin 10,000 U: 3 tablets at breakfast, 3 tablets at lunch and 3 tablets at dinner. Continue with the usual regimen of novomix 26 IU at breakfast, 14 IU at lunch and 18 IU at dinner. Furosemide 40 mg 1 tablet at breakfast and half a tablet at lunch. Bisoprolol 2.5 mg 1/2 tablet at breakfast. Rivaroxaban 20 mg 1 tablet at breakfast. Spironolactone 100 mg 1/2 tablet at breakfast. Ramipril 2.5 mg every 12 hours. Pantoprazole 40 mg 1 tablet at breakfast. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O
A 43-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for at least ten years, on antiretroviral treatment.  History, current illness and physical examination Hepatitis C 1b RNA+ virus infection with hypertransaminasemia. Probable clinically resolved cerebral toxoplasmosis with stable residual lesions in radiological controls. Secondary comic crisis, without recurrence. Ex-smoker. No other history of interest. As usual treatment for his HIV infection the patient had a regimen based on two protease inhibitors (atazanavir + ritonavir) together with a combination of nucleoside analogue antiretrovirals (emtricitabine + tenofovir). The patient was brought to the emergency department after starting a week earlier with symptoms of respiratory infection, followed by rapidly progressive dyspnoea. On arrival, he presented with severe respiratory distress, arterial oxygen desaturation and bronchospasm, so 400 mg of hydrocortisone were administered together with nebulisations of salbutamol and ipratropium bromide. Despite this, he presented a poor clinical evolution, with progressive arterial desaturation (83% despite high-flow oxygen therapy) and marked hypertension (200/100 mmHg). Auscultation showed bilateral crackles up to midfield. Chest X-ray showed severe cardiomegaly and bilateral alveolar oedema compatible with acute pulmonary oedema. An urgent echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle with very severe global systolic dysfunction (estimated LVEF of 15%), with severe generalised hypokinesia, and severe mitral insufficiency of functional origin. He was admitted to the ICU where high-dose intravenous diuretic treatment and non-invasive mechanical ventilation were started, stabilising the patient and initiating progressive clinical improvement over the following hours. Serial analyses showed elevated markers of myocardial damage, with a CPK peak of 3,300 and troponin I of 6. He presented two febrile peaks of 38.4oC, with several negative blood cultures.  Complementary tests - ECG: On arrival at the ED, sinus tachycardia at 156 bpm. Left axis. Signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. Anterior and inferior Q, with 1 mm ST supradelevation from V1 to V4. - Echocardiogram: severely dilated left ventricle, with severely reduced systolic function (ejection fraction by Simpson biplane of 15%), due to severe generalised hypokinesia. Severe functional mitral insufficiency. Moderately dilated left atrium. Right ventricle of borderline size with reduced TAPSE (14 mm). Inferior cava not dilated with inspiratory collapse present. Absence of tricuspid insufficiency to estimate pulmonary artery pressure. Minimal detachment of pericardial leaflets. - Coronography: Left common trunk of good calibre with no notable lesions. Anterior descending artery (LAD) with segment with severe atheromatosis that includes its ostium, the proximal-medial LAD and the ostium of the first diagonal. Critical lesion in the middle LAD. Small second ramaseptal with severe disease and very thin calibre. Circumflex of medium calibre and good development with severe lesion (90%) in the proximal third, of complex appearance. Dominant right coronary artery, with diffuse atheromatosis, multisegment. More severe lesion in distal third (60%). Moderate lesion in posterolateral branch (50%), with distal bed of fine calibre. - Lipid profile: cholesterol 241 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 41 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 179 mg/dl, triglycerides 104 mg/dl (0.0-150.0).  Clinical course With non-invasive mechanical ventilation and treatment with diuretics and vasodilators, the patient's clinical evolution was favourable over the following days. Once the heart failure was resolved, a study of dilated cardiomyopathy was performed, suspecting, after elevation of markers of myocardial damage, ischaemic origin of the same. Coronary angiography showed diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease, with severe lesions on the LAD and CX, which were treated by angioplasty and implantation of drug-eluting stents. There were no subsequent complications, and he was finally discharged with medical treatment.  Diagnosis Ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy in a patient with chronic HIV infection. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We are dealing with a 26-year-old male who presented to the Emergency Department for dyspnoea.  History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: Allergic to ASA (development of urticaria and angioedema). Smoker of 1 pack/day, occasionally marijuana. No other toxic habits. Viral myocarditis about ten years ago, diagnosed in Colombia. Admitted the previous month to Cardiology for dyspnoea, diagnosed with rapid ACFA and HF, requesting voluntary discharge without completing the study.  Usual treatment: Digoxin (1.0.0.0), Acovil 5 (1.0.0.0), Seguril (1.1.0), which the patient reported not taking. Current illness: Progressive dyspnoea of 3-4 weeks' evolution, which in the last few days has become minimal effort, together with orthopnoea, cough and non-thermometric dysthermic sensation. He denies chest pain, palpitations or other accompanying organotropic symptoms.  General examination: BP 104/72 mm Hg, HR 176 bpm, Ta 36.7 oC, baseline Sat02 94%. The patient is conscious, oriented, well hydrated and perfused, normocholoured and eupneic at rest. C&C: No IY. AC: Arrhythmic, pansystolic murmur in mitral focus, with 3rd noise. AP: bibasal crackles. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, sounds present. No liver or splenomegaly. No peritonism. Lower extremities: No oedema or signs of DVT. Pedial pulses present and symmetrical.  Complementary tests - ECG: thick wave ACFA at 170-180 bpm. Axis a-60o. Rest of the tracing normal. - Chest X-ray: Cardiomegaly ++, with aneurysmal LA. No obvious condensation. Interstitial pattern. - Laboratory tests: Biochemistry and haemacytometry normal. INR 1.07. Chagas serology: Negative. Urine toxicity: Positive for Cannabis. - Echocardiography: severely dilated LV, with increased wall thickness, and increased trabeculation, especially in the mid-apical segments of the entire ventricle, respecting the basal segments, with very severe trabeculation throughout the apex (the findings were confirmed after administration of echocardiographic contrast). Severe systolic dysfunction (EF by Simpson biplane 27%). DTD: 66; DTS: 55. Aneurysmal LA (80 mm). Fibrotic and thickened mitral valve with severe MR directed towards the posterolateral wall of the LV, secondary to annular dilatation and tenting with pseudoprolapse of the anterior leaflet. Normofunctioning trivalve aortic valve. Slightly dilated right chambers. RV with moderate-severe dysfunction (TAPSE of 14 mm and tricuspid annulus S wave of 6 cm/s). Mild TR with RV-AD gradient of 40 (estimated PSAP of 60 as the inferior vena cava is 26 mm, without inspiratory collapse). Slight pericardial effusion. - MRI: LV severely dilated with severely depressed global and segmental systolic dysfunction with preserved diffuse hypokinesia. EF: 29%. Absence of compaction except in basal segments and medial septum with a ratio of non-compacted myocardium/compacted myocardium greater than 3:1 At the level of the lateral apical face, findings compatible with non-compacted cardiomyopathy. No RV involvement is demonstrated. No thrombi are visualised. Thinning of the compacted myocardium in the affected segments, especially in the mid anterior face with a thickness of 4 mm in the end-diastolic phase. Severe dilatation of the left atrium. Mitral insufficiency which appears significant. Small pericardial effusion. Non-dilated RV with moderate dysfunction. EF 31%. In the late enhancement sequences no pathological uptakes are seen.  Clinical course The patient was diagnosed with non-compaction cardiomyopathy with severe LV dysfunction. Medical treatment was started with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone inhibitors and oral anticoagulants, with rapid clinical improvement. After completing the study, it was decided to discharge him home with the treatment described above, with subsequent appointments at our hospital's Heart Failure Department. First-degree relatives were contacted to perform a structural study, by means of echocardiography and genetic testing.

61-year-old woman with a history of high blood pressure and smoking. Family history: a sister who "suffers from heart disease", with no other relevant data.  History, current disease and physical examination Her medical history includes a transthoracic echocardiography in 2010 with the following data: Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Moderate MI. Normal LV systolic function. Slightly dilated LA (LA volume: 30 ml/m2). LV hypertrophy mainly at the level of the interventricular septum. Mitral valve function with incomplete SAM and dynamic gradient in LVOT (Baseline: 40 mmHg, which after Valsalva manoeuvres reaches up to 57 mmHg). The patient had not undergone subsequent follow-up. She came to the emergency department in November 2012, reporting a progressive increase in dyspnoea for about four months, which in recent weeks has evolved rapidly to the point of becoming resting, and which is accompanied by intense asthenia. He denies other associated cardiological or infectious symptoms. She denies a history of palpitations or syncope. Examination revealed the presence of an intense systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation, predominantly in the left parasternal border, which increased with Valsalva manoeuvres and did not clear the second tone. There was also a loud regurgitation murmur in the mitral focus radiating to the axilla. Pulmonary auscultation showed crackles up to the apex and generalised wheezing. A symmetrical magnus and celer pulse was palpated. Otherwise he is haemodynamically stable with basal saturation of 90% and blood pressure of 183/89. Heart rate: 73 bpm.  Complementary tests - ECG: On admission with sinus rhythm at 76 bpm. Doubtful ST elevation, 1mm in V1, similar to previous ECG. Criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. - Chest X-ray: shows borderline CTI and bilateral centrifugal alveolar infiltrate. Laboratory tests showed BNP of 3,000 with no other relevant alterations. - Transthoracic echocardiogram: Performed during his admission to the Cardiology Department of our hospital. It reflected the following findings: LVH data with interventricular septum of 27 mm, LV posterior wall of 20 mm. Gradient across the LVOT reaching 120 mmHg. Presence of systolic anterior motion of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve contributing to the mechanism of moderate-severe MI. - 24-hour Holter-ECG: Showing sinus rhythm throughout the recording, with high-density polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles, isolated, sparsely bigeminy and in pairs, as well as several bouts of ventricular tachycardia, the most prolonged of eight beats. No pathological pauses. - Haemodynamic study: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a dynamic gradient of 130 to 140 mmHg, accompanied by severe mitral insufficiency (III/IV). Coronary angiography showed no significant lesions and evidenced the existence of an anatomically adequate septal branch for septal ablation.  Clinical evolution With this information, the existing therapeutic possibilities were discussed with the patient, who opted to undergo percutaneous septal ablation. The patient was transferred to the haemodynamics room where, under sedation, the intervention was performed. The MCP cable was placed in the right ventricle with access through the right femoral vein. A balloon catheter was introduced via the arterial route through the left coronary artery until it reached the first septal branch. Subsequently, the expected response to ischaemia induced by occluding the first septal branch by inflating the balloon at that level, together with the injection of echocardiographic contrast, is assessed by echocardiographic support. Induction of ischaemia in the desired proximal septal region is verified, as well as a fall in the gradient across the LVOT, so alcohol is infused in this area. At this point the patient becomes dependent on MCP pacing. After a few minutes, a significant drop in the gradient to 70 mmHg and a decrease in mitral regurgitation was observed. Angiographically, a small sub-branch of the aforementioned septal branch was observed to be permeable, so an additional 1cc of absolute alcohol was infused, bringing the gradient down a further 10 mmHg. The patient was transferred to the Coronary Unit with alternating pacing and pacemaker pacing, and in a stable haemodynamic condition. Enzyme seriation showed a peak troponin level of 90 ng/dL. No malignant ventricular arrhythmias were recorded in the monitoring and given the good evolution of the patient, it was decided to transfer her to the ward after 72 hours. On admission, the woman presented with severe acute pulmonary oedema in the context of heart failure due to severe obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract and associated mitral insufficiency. Symptomatic treatment was initiated with careful use of diuretics and lusotopics, and after reaching the diagnosis by careful examination and imaging techniques, the patient was offered the available treatment options. At discharge, there was still a high gradient, around 60 mmHg, and moderate mitral regurgitation, but the patient showed a marked symptomatic improvement, being eupneic in decubitus, with good tolerance to the onset of physical activity and in a clinical situation that she described as excellent. She was discharged with generous doses of lusotopic treatment and was soon to be reviewed by the Cardiology Department.  Diagnosis - Heart failure with acute pulmonary oedema. - Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with severe LVOT obstruction. Treated by percutaneous alcohol ablation of the first septal branch. - Complete AV block during the procedure resolved at discharge. - Moderate mitral insufficiency. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

42-year-old male presenting with chest pain.  History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: Rheumatic fever in childhood. IQ: Osteosynthesis in EID. Seaman by profession. No usual treatment. AF: Brother died at 35 years of age due to AMI. Present illness: 42-year-old male presenting with epigastric and oppressive precordial pain associated with vegetative cortex lasting 3 hours. The previous month he had presented with sinusitis treated with antibiotics. In view of his clinical presentation, he went to his health centre, where an ECG was performed.  Physical examination: Patient conscious and oriented. Eupneic. BP 130/90 mmHg, HR 73 bpm. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: no pathological findings. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of DVT. Distal pulses present and symmetrical.  Complementary tests - ECG: regular wide QRS tachycardia, 220 bpm, right bundle branch block morphology and superior axis. - Catheterisation: Coronary angiography: No angiographically significant coronary lesions. Left ventriculography: Severe systolic dysfunction. - Laboratory tests: Peak TnT ultrasensitive peak of 267 ng/L. - Echocardiogram 3 days after admission: non-dilated left ventricle with slightly depressed global systolic function and severe hypokinesia of the basal and middle segments of the lateral, inferior and posterior face, without significant valvulopathies. - Cardiac MRI: Hypokinesia of mid-apical segments of the lateral face and akinesia of the basal segment of the lateral face. In the late myocardial enhancement series, subepicardial base uptake is demonstrated, respecting the subendocardium, affecting lateral and inferior segments at basal and mid level. Mild pericardial effusion. Findings compatible with acute myocarditis. - Electrophysiological study: Using a digital anatomical reconstruction system, two areas of subventricular eschar are evident. Ventricular tachycardias of the same morphology as that presented by the patient on admission were induced on several occasions, but with poor clinical tolerance that prevented their mapping and forced them to be terminated with over-stimulation. Finally, it was decided to perform several radiofrequency applications around the bedsores in sinus rhythm.  Clinical evolution In view of the patient's clinical and ECG findings, the Emergency Department was notified, who prescribed sedation and performed synchronised ECV at 100J, reverting to sinus rhythm, and the patient was subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit of his referral hospital. At the centre, coronary angiography and serial analyses were performed, with the aforementioned results. Once clinical stability was achieved, the patient was discharged to the hospital ward and treatment was started with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers with good clinical tolerance. An echocardiogram was performed, which showed an improvement in left ventricular function compared to the ventriculography performed on admission, and cardiac MRI, with findings compatible with acute myocarditis. Following an electrophysiological study, an ICD was implanted without incident, and the patient was discharged home with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.  Diagnosis Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia reverted to sinus rhythm with CVE in the context of probable acute myocarditis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 47-year-old male patient came to our centre to rule out acute coronary syndrome.  History, current illness and physical examination A 47-year-old male patient from the Philippines, with no known toxic habits or drug allergies. Pathological history: hypertension treated with ARA II. Moderate severe aortic insufficiency with last echocardiogram in 2004 with preserved EF. First degree AV block (PR 300-320 msec). No other history of interest. Current illness: Consultation to the emergency department for cough and fever. He was discharged with a diagnosis of bronchial infection and was prescribed treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and nebulisations. Ten days later, he re-consulted at another hospital due to persistent cough, to which dyspnoea and mechanical lumbar pain were added. He denied fever, febrile equivalents or symptoms suggestive of bacteraemia. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and discordant aortic aneurysm, but a pulmonary infiltrate was observed in the left upper lobe. Laboratory tests showed CRP 41 mg/dl, the only determination of TnT US 103 ng/L. At that time he was referred to our centre to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Physical examination in the emergency department: Good general condition, conscious and oriented. BP: 124/50, Axillary T.: 36.4, SatO2: 99% Cardiovascular: Regular sounds, 2/4 pandiastolic murmur. No IY, no RHY. No oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. Pulses symmetrical, alive and jumping. No carotid murmurs. Respiratory: Bladder murmur preserved, no other added sounds. Digestive: No signs of peritonism, positive right renal fist percussion. Neurological: No signs of neurological focality or meningism.  Complementary tests - Laboratory tests: Urea 36 mg/dL, creatinine 0.86 mg/dL, sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 4.04 mmol/L, chlorine 108 mmol/L. CRP 7.4 mg/dL. Hb 10.8 g/dL. Leukocytes 10,500 cells/mm3. Platelets 280.000, PT 64%. Urine sediment: S5 red blood cells, S0 leukocytes. Sputum BK (1st) negative. Urine Ag (pneumococcus and legionella) negative. - ECG: Sinus rhythm. FC 68 bpm. PR 320 msec (already described). QRS duration 100 msec. QRS 0° QTc axis 420 msec. Criteria left ventricular enlargement. Non-specific intra-ventricular conduction disorder. - Chest X-ray: Condensation in LSI. - Thoracic-abdominal CT angiography (reviewed by the Radiology Department of our centre): Large cardiomegaly with a certain component of heart failure (reflux of contrast towards the hepatic veins) in addition to a focus of sub-pleural condensation in LSI with a ground-glass halo that could correspond to a pneumonic focus. Renal micro-density of less than 1 cm, non-specific. No other findings of note.  Clinical evolution An echocardiogram was performed which showed an image suggestive of vegetation 10 mm in the bicuspid aortic valve. Severe aortic insufficiency. In the mitral valve, perforation of the anterior leaflet with moderate-severe insufficiency. Ascending aorta 45 mm. Global hypokinesia, left ventricular ejection fraction 45%, mild tricuspid insufficiency. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. At that time the Cardiology Service was notified. Physical examination revealed signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram showed PR lengthening up to 400 msec. Given the suspicion of endocarditis complicated by heart failure, valvular rupture and possible abscess in the aortic annulus, it was decided to transfer the patient to the Coronary Unit to await surgery. Treatment was started with ampicillin, gentamicin and cloxacillin. Blood cultures were negative at all times. Due to intraventricular conduction disturbance, a provisional MCP was implanted and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed an abscess at the mitro-aortic junction draining into the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and fistulisation into the right atrium (RA). Non-invasive digital angiography with pre-surgical multi-detector CT showed no significant coronary lesions and confirmed the LVOT-to-AD fistula. Surgical intervention revealed vegetations in the right coronary and non-coronary leaflets of the aortic valve, with extension to the anterior mitral leaflet of the mitral valve. The aortic valve was replaced with a 21 mm mechanical prosthesis and the mitral valve was replaced with a 27 mm mechanical prosthesis, preserving the mitro-aortic junction. Antibiotic treatment was continued with amipicillin, gentamicin and cloxacillin. Blood cultures, catheter and surgical specimen cultures were negative. Due to persistent episodes of advanced atrioventricular block (AVB), on the fifteenth post-operative day, a permanent VDD pacemaker was implanted without incident. Due to the appearance of pleural and pericardial effusion, with auscultation of pericardial friction rub, treatment was started with ASA and colchicine. Due to persistent pericardial effusion and the appearance of haemodynamic compromise, pericardiocentesis via the left anterior subcostal route was decided. The puncture was performed without complications. A fluid with haematic characteristics was obtained and sent for analysis. After removal of approximately 800 cc of fluid, a negative pressure drainage system was left in place. Post-procedural ECHO showed a significant reduction in pericardial effusion, with persistent posterior predominance of fluid, now with better expansion of the right cavities compared to the previous ECHO. Since then, haemodynamically stable with blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg and improvement of his general condition. At 24 hours the drain was removed with a total extraction of 950 cc. Echocardiogram after removal of the drain: moderate pericardial effusion predominantly inferoposterior. Despite this, 24:00 hours after removal of the pericardial drain, he complained of intense dizziness and profuse sweating accompanied by hypotension 93/50 mm Hg. In view of the suspicion of new tamponade, a portable echocardiogram was performed which showed anterior pericardial effusion, especially basal (25 mm) with echoes inside suggesting haematoma with compression of the RV, which could not be approached by subcostal puncture, for which reason the patient was again referred to Cardiac Surgery for urgent surgery. The patient evolved favourably after surgery and was discharged home after 2 weeks postoperatively.  Diagnosis Aortic valve endocarditis with negative blood cultures complicated by: - Severe aortic insufficiency - Mitral insufficiency due to perforation of the anterior mitral leaflet - Secondary heart failure - Periaortic abscess - Complete atrioventricular atrial ventricular block secondary to abscess - Left ventricular outflow tract fistula to left atrium secondary to abscess. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 43-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with ischaemic chest pain of more than a week's duration.  History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: NAMC. Former cocaine user. Smoker and heavy drinker. Nodal tuberculosis (diagnosed in July 2011) with necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis with tuberculous profile. Syphilis. Deep vein thrombosis of DID and portomesenteric thrombosis. Recent anterior AMI. Usual treatment: Sintrom, pantecta, rifampicin/isoniazid, ethambutol, ASA, atorvastatin, coropres, acovil, omeprazole. BFS: Higher functions preserved, autonomous for ABVD. Current illness: Admitted to the Coronary Unit on 11/10/2012 for previous AMI, requesting voluntary discharge without catheterisation or medical treatment. Since then, he has presented recurrent chest pains and so he came to the emergency department again on 20/10/2012 for another episode of pain, referred by his primary care physician. With a diagnosis of advanced AMI, she was again transferred to the Coronary Care Unit. Examination: BP 134/91 mm Hg; HR 100 bpm; Ta 36.2 oC. Conscious and oriented, cooperative. Good peripheral perfusion. Adequate muco-cutaneous colouring. Eupneic at rest. Head and neck: No IY. AC: rhythmic at 100 bpm, systolic murmur in mitral focus. AP: VCM. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation. No evidence of peritoneal irritation. Sounds present. Hepatomegaly. Lower extremities: No oedema or evidence of DVT.  Complementary tests - ECG: Sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, QRS axis at 0o, Q waves in inferior face, ST segment elevation in anteroseptal face and negative T waves in all precordial leads. - Echocardiogram: LV slightly dilated (LVEDD 56 mm) with normal wall thickness. Moderately depressed systolic function (LVED 40%) due to apical aneurysm, akinesia of the mid-apical segments of the septum, inferior and anterior face, hypokinesia of the posterior face, maintaining only the contractility of the lateral face and basal segments of the rest of the faces. A large thrombus is observed adhered to the apex. Pseudonormalised diastolic pattern. Mitral valve with moderate central regurgitation. Aortic root not dilated (35 mm). Aortic valve without detectable functional alterations. Slight biauricular dilatation. RV not dilated and without signs of dysfunction. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with a RV-AD gradient of 35 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. - Chest X-ray: Cardiomegaly, no pulmonary condensation images, free costophrenic sinuses.  Given that it was an AMI of more than a week's evolution, with necrosis in the ECG and development of apical aneurysm and an intracavitary thrombus in the echocardiogram, urgent catheterisation was not performed and medical treatment was prescribed with antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation at full doses, lipid-lowering agents, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, maintaining his tuberculostatic treatment. The study was completed with: Catheterisation: Left coronary angiography: The common trunk shows no lesions. The anterior descending artery is occluded in its distal segment after the birth of a large diagonal branch. The circumflex artery is of medium development without lesions. Right coronary angiography: It is the dominant vessel and of great extension. Mild atheromatosis in the middle third. Conclusions: Severe single-vessel coronary artery disease due to distal occlusion of the LAD. Cardiac MRI: dilated LV with severe systolic dysfunction. LVEF: 28%. Saccular dilatation at the level of the apex with akinesia of the apical segments of all the faces with heterogeneous density content with liquid areas inside that in the perfusion sequences do not seem to be related to the ventricular cavity. Likewise, the lateral aspect does not show continuity of the myocardium with the saccular area described. Late enhancement sequences show 50% subendocardial enhancement in mid-apical segments of the inferior face and septum, with transmural enhancement in the rest of the apical segments. The patient had a torpid evolution with heart failure that was difficult to manage and systemic embolisation despite anticoagulation, so in view of this clinical picture and given the findings described (anterior AMI evolved with apical aneurysm and thrombus inside, together with doubtful rupture of the LV wall with some associated pericardial effusion), cardiac surgery was consulted and surgery was scheduled. He underwent surgery on 17/11/2012 and left ventricular aneurysm resection and thrombus extraction, with subsequent closure with a pericardial patch. No rupture of the LV free wall was visualised. In the immediate postoperative period he required vasoactive drugs due to haemodynamic instability, which could be suspended on the 2nd day post IQ. He was extubated and the rest of the postoperative period was uneventful. He was discharged to the ward after 3 days in the Coronary Unit and home a week later.  Diagnosis - Evolved Killip II/IV anterior infarction with severe systolic dysfunction. - Apical aneurysm with intraventricular thrombosis. - Surgical intervention with resection of the LV aneurysm and extraction of the intraventricular thrombus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Emergency due to dizziness and fall to the floor at home, without loss of consciousness and without injuries secondary to the trauma.  History, current illness and physical examination 78-year-old female patient, allergic to penicillins, with a personal history of obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, on treatment with hydrochlorothiazide 40 mg - olmersatan 25 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg and omeprazole 20 mg. Appendectomised. Baseline situation: NYHA function class I-II. She presented suddenly at 9:00 am, with dizziness and a fall to the floor at home, without loss of consciousness and without injuries secondary to the trauma. She was seen a few hours later by a relative, who found her very anxious due to her inability to get up from the floor after the fall. Emergency services were called and she was transferred to our Emergency Department. On arrival, Glasgow 15, BP 80/40 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, 02 saturation 80%, tachypnoea of 25 rpm. While in the observation room, she presented with self-limited tonic-clonic crises, after which she reported intense central thoracic pain, oppressive, radiating to the interscapular area and significant accompanying vegetative cortex.  Physical examination: Conscious and oriented. Poor general condition. Skin pallor. Central cyanosis. Carotids symmetrical and rhythmic. Jugular ingurgitation. CVM with bilateral crackles up to midfields. Rhythmic heart tones; systolic murmur III/IV in mitral focus, radiating to the axilla. Abdomen without pathological alterations. Palpable and symmetrical paedial pulses. Malleolar oedema II/IV.  Complementary tests - CBC: Leukocytes 13.800 thousands/μl, PMN 70%, HB 12.2 gr/dl, OHT 36.3%, platelets 127 thousands/μl, prothrombin activity 98%, aTTP 27.5 ́ ́, fibrinogen 343 mg/dl, Glu 159 mg/dl, urea 39 mg/dl, Cr 1 mg/dl, Na 142 mmol/l, K 4.1 4.2 mmol/, Mg 1.8 mmol/L, Cl 116 mmol/L, CPK 810 Ui/L, CKMB 63 ng/ml, troponin I 17.98 ng/ml. - Arterial blood gas: pH 7.38, pC02 27 mmHg, P02 110 mmHg, HC03 13 24.8 mmol/, EB -7.7, Sat02 98%, lactate 12mg/dl. - Chest X-ray: Cardiothoracic index at the upper limit of normality, hilar thickening, fluid in cystic cracks and pinched costophrenic sinuses. - ECG: RS at 90lpm, with generalised ST segment decline and ST rise of 1 mm in aVR. - Urgent TTE: Left ventricle without significant hypertrophy or dilatation, with severely depressed systolic function (15%). Mid-apical hypokinesia, with preserved contractility at the level of the basal segments. Grade III mitral insufficiency. Mild aortic insufficiency and moderate pulmonary hypertension. No dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. No pericardial effusion. Dilated inferior vena cava with inspiratory collapse less than 50%.  Clinical course In cardiogenic shock, the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU), starting vasoactive support with noradrenaline (0.6 μg/kg/min) and dobutamine (10-12 μg/kg/min). Coronary angiography showed parietal irregularities, without angiographically significant lesions. Ventriculography showed severe ventricular dysfunction and typical Tako-tsubo morphology. During the procedure, an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was implanted via the right femoral artery. In the first 24 hours of admission, the patient required non-invasive mechanical ventilation due to hypoxaemic respiratory failure related to acute pulmonary oedema. The patient's evolution was favourable, allowing the IABP to be withdrawn 48 hours after admission and ventilatory support to be provided gradually over the following days. The enzyme peak was: CPK 1430, CK-MB 60.2 and troponin I 19.06. Prior to discharge, TTE was repeated and showed recovery of systolic function (LVEF by Simpson biplane 45%) with persistence of discrete hypokinesia of the middle portions. After twelve days in the CCU, she was discharged to the cardiology ward.  Diagnosis Tako-tsubo syndrome complicated by cardiogenic shock. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 48-year-old man came to the emergency department with a sudden episode of non-radiating stabbing chest pain that started suddenly while he was driving. It was not accompanied by dyspnoea, palpitations or syncope.  History, present illness and physical examination 48-year-old male, with no known allergies, with several cardiovascular risk factors including heavy smoking (2-3 packs/day), untreated hypertension and moderate obesity, with no other history of interest. By profession, Labrador. He came to the emergency department for an episode of non-radiating stabbing chest pain that started suddenly while he was driving. It was not accompanied by dyspnoea, palpitations or syncope. On arrival, he was in poor general condition, with profuse sweating and tachypnoea. Blood pressure was 200/81 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats per minute and oxygen saturation 86%. Physical examination revealed an IV/VI diastolic murmur, more noticeable on the left sternal border, generalised hypoventilation with crackles in both lung bases, tibiomalleolar oedema with fovea and peripheral pulses present and symmetrical. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Complementary tests - ECG on admission: Sinus rhythm at 90 bpm. Normal PR. Narrow QRS. Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Negative T in lateral face. - Emergency analytical: Highlights glycaemia 185 mg/dl, CRP 60 and elevated myocardial necrosis markers (maximum US TnT 180 ng/ml, without typical curve). - Chest X-ray: Cardiomegaly. Aortic elongation. Hilar thickening. - CT angiography: aortic root and proximal segment of ascending aorta at the upper limit of normality, with the rest of the aorta of normal calibre, without signs suggestive of aortic syndrome. Mild cardiomegaly and small pericardial effusion. At the abdominal level, there was only discrete hepatomegaly with hepatic steatosis. - Transthoracic echocardiogram: The main finding was the presence of moderate-severe aortic insufficiency over the trivalve valve, secondary to dilatation of the aortic annulus. The left ventricle is slightly dilated (end-diastolic diameter of 60 mm) with severe concentric hypertrophy (15-16 mm) and preserved global and segmental systolic function. Both the right ventricle and the rest of the valves show no pathological findings. - Cardiac MRI: The study was of suboptimal technical quality due to lack of cooperation from the patient to correctly perform apnoeas. The left ventricle showed moderate eccentric hypertrophy, dilatation (telediastolic volume of 124 ml/m2 and end-systolic volume of 50 ml/m2) and segmental and global systolic function within normal limits (ejection fraction of 60%). The right ventricle was normal in dimensions and systolic function. There was no evidence of oedema or alterations in perfusion or late gadolinium enhancement. Significant apparent aortic insufficiency was detected, but the poor quality of the study did not allow adequate quantification. Aortic root dilatation (sinuses of Valsalva: 50 mm, 21 mm/m2) and tubular portion of ascending aorta (48 mm, 20 mm/m2) were observed. - Diagnostic cardiac catheterisation: The main finding is in the aortography, where there is evidence of dilatation of the ascending aorta from the root, with effacement of the sinuses of Valsalva, and grade IV aortic insufficiency. The coronary arteries showed no significant angiographic lesions. - Transesophageal echocardiogram: This was interrupted due to poor tolerance given the patient's clinical situation (heart failure). Only a trivalve aortic valve with correct opening was visualised, without being able to assess aortic root or valvular insufficiency. - Analysis on the hospital ward: There was moderate renal failure, with urea 78 mg/dL, creatinine 1.53 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 48.82 mL/minute. Liver enzymes were slightly elevated, and glycosylated haemoglobin was 7.8%. The rest of the biochemistry, as well as the haemogram, were normal.  Clinical course During his stay in the ED, CT angiography was performed to rule out acute aortic syndrome given the patient's presentation with hypertensive emergency, stabbing pain and troponin elevation. The CT angiography was reported as normal, so the patient was admitted to cardiology to study chest pain with elevated markers of myocardial necrosis and heart failure. On the second day of admission to cardiology, the patient presented a fever peak of 38.5o, with no apparent infectious focus (neither clinically nor in complementary tests), and with negative blood cultures. Given the presence of moderate-severe aortic insufficiency in the transthoracic echocardiogram, a transesophageal study was performed on suspicion of endocarditis as a possible aetiology of the clinical picture. The patient's clinical condition meant that he did not tolerate the procedure adequately, and although no clear signs of endocarditis were observed, the study was of poor quality and was stopped early. In the following days, the patient does not present fever or infectious symptoms again. There were no new episodes of chest pain; however, in the serial ECGs there was a negative T-wave in the anterior face, so a stress cardiac MRI was requested to assess the presence of necrosis or inducible ischaemia. The MRI was negative, ruling out signs of myocarditis or myocardial necrosis, but aortic insufficiency of severe appearance was again observed. However, given that the patient continued to present progressive elevation of troponin and the electrical changes persisted (deepening of the T wave on the lateral side), a diagnostic cardiac catheterisation was requested, which showed a non-significant lesion in the RCA and confirmed the severity of the aortic insufficiency. On the 5th day of admission, the patient presented a new febrile peak of 38o, and an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation with failed pharmacological and electrical cardioversion, in the context of mild decompensation of heart failure. Once again, a battery of tests was requested to rule out infection, which was ruled out, with negative blood cultures again. On the 7th day of admission to Cardiology, he presented an episode of desaturation, tachypnoea and hypotension, compatible with acute pulmonary oedema, for which he was admitted to the Coronary Unit and finally required orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, as well as inotropic support with vasoactive drugs. A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed with the patient intubated, ruling out endocarditis, and finally a localised dissection of the aortic root responsible for the severe aortic insufficiency was observed, and Cardiovascular Surgery was contacted for urgent intervention. Intraoperatively, a type A dissection was observed, with circumferential intimal rupture at the level of the sinotubular junction causing sagging of all the commissures, this being the mechanism of the aortic insufficiency observed. During his admission to the Coronary Unit after surgery, he evolved slowly but favourably, without new febrile peaks and with improvement in the clinical signs of heart failure, and was discharged on the 7th day post-surgery. One month later, the patient is clinically stable and asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view, with no aortic insufficiency in the outpatient echocardiogram.  Diagnosis Localised aortic root dissection with acute severe aortic insufficiency. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Previous myocardial infarction 1 year earlier, treated with fibrinolysis and subsequent cardiac catheterisation in which he had an intermediate lesion in the anterior descending and circumflex arteries and chronic occlusion of the DC, not revascularised, dilated left ventricle with depressed LVEF (40%). Cardiovascular risk factors: Arterial hypertension. Dyslipidaemia. Obesity. Ex. smoker of 10 cigarettes/day for the last 3 months. Chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs. Family history: Father with Chagas disease and myocardial infarction at the age of 59. Surgical interventions: cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, appendectomy. Usual treatment: Clopidogrel/acetylsalicylic acid 75/100 mg c/24h, bisoprolol 2.5/24h, ramipril 2.5/24h, ranitidine 150mg c/24h, alprazolam 0.25 mg c/24h. The patient came to the emergency department for sudden and intense dyspnoea of less than 1 hour's duration, at rest, without chest pain. She presented 1 vomit of food coinciding with the dyspnoea. He denies fever, withdrawal of medication or other intercurrent process. He also reports exertional dyspnoea in recent months, which has been progressing until it has become light exertion and nocturnal dyspnoea for weeks. She has been sleeping with three pillows for years. On physical examination the patient was awake, alert, tachypneic, sweating, afebrile. BP 140/80 MMHG, intercostal stretch, intolerance to decubitus, no jugular engorgement, no carotid murmurs. AC: rhythmic, no murmurs. AP: preserved vesicular murmur, isolated wheezing and bibasal crackles. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.  Complementary tests - Biochemistry: sodium 145 mmol/L, potassium 3.6 mmol/L CPK-MB 3.7 ng/mL, myoglobin 86* ng/mL (VN: 15-72), ultrasensitive troponin T 44.5**ng/L (VN: 0-14), urea 64, creatinine 1.30 mg/dL. - Haemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, haematocrit 39.8%, leucocytes 9,320, platelets 244,00. Coagulation normal. - Blood gas on arrival: Global respiratory failure with acidosis pH 7.145, pCO2 61.3 mmHg, pO2 46.6 mmHg. Bicarbonate 20.6 mmol/L, O2Sat 66.2%. - Blood gases after treatment: pH 7,365, pCO2 32.6 mmHg, pO2 65.6 mmHg. Bicarbonate 18.2 mmol/L, O2Sat 92.9%. - ECG: Sinus rhythm at 90 bpm. Axis 60o. Inferior Q and QS V3-V6, with negative T. Normal PR. Narrow QRS (110ms) (similar to previous recordings). - Chest X-ray: global cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular redistribution. - Chest CT: Large cardiomegaly. Signs of apical vascular redistribution. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion. Bilateral basal atelectasis of lung tissue, mainly on the right. Mild signs of bilateral interstitial pattern. No signs of PTE (central/bilateral). - Echocardiogram: Left ventricle severely dilated (Dd 6.9 cm, volume 222 cm3), with thinning of walls, akinesia of all anterior segments, only basal septum and lateral segments contracting. Estimated LVEF: 31% M-mode and 35% by Simpson. Restrictive mitral pattern (E/A 2.8; deceleration time 170 ms). Dilated left atrium (4.4 cm area 30 cm2). Dilated right chambers, with decreased TAPSE. Aorta not dilated. No significant valvular alterations. Pulmonary acceleration time shortened by 87 ms. Normal pericardium. Inferior vena cava not dilated.  Clinical evolution The patient improved rapidly with the treatment prescribed in the emergency department (high-flow oxygen, nitroglycerine and morphine chloride). Given the suddenness of the symptoms with acute respiratory failure and elevated D-dimers, a chest CT scan was performed to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism. He was subsequently transferred to the cardiology ward where he remained clinically and haemodynamically stable, tolerating increasing doses of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and eplerenone and progressive reduction of furosemide. A new cardiac catheterisation was performed which showed no changes in the coronary arteries with respect to the one performed a year earlier. The patient had dilated cardiomyopathy of probable ischaemic origin with progressive deterioration until dyspnoea at rest. However, the patient came from a Chagas endemic area and had a family history of the disease, so it was decided to request serology for Trypanosoma cruzi, which was positive. DNA amplification by PCR of Trypanosoma cruzi in whole blood was also positive and the patient was diagnosed with chronic Chagas disease. Given the severe ventricular dysfunction and poor functional class that persisted despite optimising medical treatment, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted as primary prevention of sudden death. In our case we are left with the doubt as to whether the cardiac involvement is only due to ischaemic heart disease, as seems more likely, or whether there is also chagasic involvement due to the patient being chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. We have not found any case in the literature in which both processes are described together.     Diagnosis - Acute heart failure: Acute pulmonary oedema. - Dilated cardiomyopathy of probable ischaemic origin with severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 30-35%) vs. chagasic cardiomyopathy. - Chronic ischaemic heart disease: inferior and anterior necrosis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical history and current illness A 54-year-old man, of Uruguayan origin, who was living in our health care area for work reasons (as a transporter). He was admitted with heart failure and episodes of back pain.  - No known drug allergies  - Smoker of 1 pack of cigarettes/day  - History of depressive syndrome  - Hypertensive and dyslipidaemic  - Carrier of chronic anti-aggregation atrial fibrillation. No previous cardiology assessment. - No family history of cardiovascular disease of interest  - Home treatment: acetylsalicylic acid, digoxin, furosemide, pravastatin   Patient with the aforementioned history was admitted 4 days ago to the Digestive Service with a clinical diagnosis of cholelithiasis with suspicion of cholangitis, based on clinical manifestations of abdominal pain of increasing intensity, colicky, which intensified with palpation of the right hypochondrium and epigastrium, accompanied by fever and laboratory data compatible with infection (discrete leukocytosis -13450 leukocytes/uL- with left deviation -91% neutrophils with 8% casts). During his stay in the Digestive Department, abdominal pain was controlled with the use of WHO scale 1 analgesics. However, in view of the marked clinical manifestations of right-sided heart failure, an echocardiogram was requested and a referral to the Cardiology Department was made. The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a type A aortic dissection with a dilated root and severe aortic insufficiency, as well as severe mitral insufficiency with a dilated and dysfunctional left ventricle. In view of these findings, the patient was admitted to the Coronary Unit to complete the study (chest CT scan) prior to surgery. On cross-examination, the patient reported progressive dyspnoea up to NYHA class II for a month and a half, and in the last week several episodes of back pain that required the administration of anti-inflammatory drugs. He did not clearly complain of chest pain.  Physical examination: - Blood pressure: 120/80 mmHg. Heart rate: 88 bpm. Temperature: 36.7 °C. - Good general appearance. Normal hydration, normal colour, normoperfused. Eupneic (SaO2 98% with nasal cannulae at 3 bpm). - Head and neck: no goitre. Carotids rhythmic and without murmurs. No jugular venous engorgement at 45°. - Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic. Decreasing diastolic exhalation murmur in accessory aortic focus of intensity IV/VI Levine scale. Decreasing holosystolic murmur of IV/VI intensity in mitral focus with irradiation to the axilla. - Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur with bibasal crackles. - Abdomen: globular, soft, depressible. No masses palpable. Hepatomegaly of 2 finger widths. Discomfort on palpation in the right hypochondrium. No signs of acute abdomen. Peristaltic sounds preserved. No abdominal murmurs. - Extremities: pulses present and symmetrical in the upper extremities. In lower limbs, presence of oedema with fovea up to the middle region of both legs, preventing the determination of peripheral pulses. Signs of venous insufficiency with no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. - Neurological: no gross neurological focality.  Complementary tests - ECG: atrial fibrillation at 88 bpm. Signs of left ventricular hypertrophy with evidence of systolic overload. - CBC: haemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, haematocrit 40.7%, leukocytes 13830/uL (85% neutrophils, 8.3% lymphocytes), platelets 245000/uL; biochemistry: glucose 102 mg/ dL, urea 44.0 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, total bilirubin 4.6 mg/dL, GOT/AST/ASAT 41 IU/L, GPT/ALT/ALAT 32 IU/L, GGT 70 IU/L, alkaline phosphatases 191 IU/L, CK 85 IU/L, troponin I 0.09 ng/dL, sodium 130 mMol/L, potassium 4.5 mMol/L; coagulation: quick's time 21.0, ratio 1.86, INR 1.84, aPTT 29.7, aPTT ratio 0.99. - Chest X-ray: enlarged cardiopericardial silhouette with Kerley's B lines and right costophrenic sinus impingement. - Echocardiogram: severely dilated left ventricle (DTD 78/DTS 67), with normal thickness (septum 10 and posterior wall 9 mm). Global hypokinesia more marked in anterior and septal territory, leading to severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF Teich 27%). Aortic valve trivava, with severe regurgitation flow (jet diameter adjusted by outflow tract diameter greater than 70%) secondary to anterior leaflet prolapse. Sclerosed mitral valve, with eccentric holosystolic insufficiency, towards the lateral wall of the left atrium, of severe degree (vena contracta 9 mm), secondary to dilatation of the mitral annulus (52 mm) with tenting of the posterior leaflet. Dilated left atrium (area 38 cm2). Dilated right ventricle (basal DTD 50 mm). Moderate tricuspid insufficiency, with RV-AD gradient 25 mmHg. TAPSE 16 mm. Dilated vena cava (26 mm) with <50% collapse. Aneurysmal ascending aorta (59 m) with an image suggestive of flap about 20 mm from the aortic root showing double lumen. It is not possible to assess the aortic arch. Slight pericardial effusion at the level of the roof of the right atrium. - Thoracic CT: aneurysm in the ascending thoracic aorta with diameters: in the valvular annulus: 3.7x3.5 cm, in the sinus portion 5.4x5.9 cm, in the sinotubular junction 5.2x5.1 cm, maximum in the ascending aorta: 6.86x6.4 cm, anterior to the brachiocephalic trunk exit: 4.5x4.4 cm, posterior to the brachiocephalic trunk exit: 4x3.4 cm, in the descending aorta: 3.2x3 cm. Type A aortic dissection starting in the sinus plane of the ascending thoracic aorta and extending to the descending thoracic aorta (2 cm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery). There is a focal haematoma/thrombus at the origin of the dissection which occupies the non-coronary sinus and extends into the region of the sinotubular junction. All three supra-aortic trunks and both carotids originate from the true lumen. Multiple repletion defects in the pulmonary arterial tree in association with pulmonary thromboembolism. At the level of the right pulmonary tree: in the right superior lobar artery with extension to its three segmental branches and several sub-segmental branches and in the bifurcation of the middle lobar artery with extension to its two segmental branches. At the level of the left pulmonary tree: in multiple segmental and subsegmental arteries of the LSI (including lingular arteries) and LII. Multiple peripheral focal pulmonary opacities in the right upper hemithorax and consolidations in the posterior regions of both lower lobes (more prominent in the left) compatible with areas of atelectasis and/or infarction. Bilateral pleural effusion. Hepatomegaly with diffuse altered enhancement in relation to stasis liver. This finding together with an increased calibre of the inferior vena cava (slightly larger than the adjacent abdominal aorta), the diffuse infiltration of the abdominal subcutaneous fat and the minimal amount of perirenal fluid suggest altered haemodynamic status due to probable right heart failure. Gall bladder stone measuring 2.3x1.7x3 cm in relation to cholelithiasis.  Clinical course A 54-year-old man was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit from the Digestive Department where he had been admitted for cholelithiasis under study. The reason for his transfer was a type A aortic dissection, in the context of biventricular dysfunction with severe aortic and mitral insufficiency, both of them severe. As a serious associated comorbidity, he also presented bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism with acceptable haemodynamic tolerance. Given the coexistence of both entities and the initial clinical and haemodynamic stability of the patient, it was decided to manage the patient conservatively at first, trying to resolve the heart failure data and see the evolution of the pulmonary arterial pathology, as there was a limitation in the use of anticoagulation at recommended doses in the presence of aortic dissection. In addition, a venous echo-Doppler of the lower limbs was performed, which ruled out the presence of deep vein thrombosis that could justify the implantation of a cava filter to prevent recurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism in a patient limited to anticoagulation. However, in subsequent days the patient evolved unfavourably, with recurrent episodes of chest pain and cardiac arrest secondary to electromechanical dissociation that required advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres, which were successfully resolved. The emergent echocardiogram ruled out cardiac tamponade and the emergent aortic angio-CT ruled out aortic rupture or associated complications, although it showed retrograde progression of the aortic dissection towards the right sinus of Valsalva without involvement of the right coronary artery. In view of this clinical situation, the decision was made to perform urgent surgery. A Bentall procedure was performed with a valved tube and mitral annuloplasty with a Carpentier ring, and the patient died in the operating theatre after unresponsive cardiac arrest.  Diagnosis - Type A aortic dissection - Bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism - Severe biventricular dysfunction - Severe aortic and mitral regurgitation |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical history and current illness 22-year-old woman with a personal history of fibromyalgia, ex-smoker of 6-8 cigarettes a day and elective caesarean section the month prior to the current admission, with subsequent readmission for febrile syndrome secondary to possible infection of the surgical wound. Microbiological isolation of wound exudate was not obtained and she was discharged home. Fever persists associated with catarrhal symptoms of the upper respiratory tract, followed by progressive dyspnoea on exertion until she rested, chest pain with pleuritic characteristics and oedema in the lower limbs.  Physical examination: - On admission, general condition was fair, tachypneic at rest and with slight jugular engorgement. - Blood pressure: 110/80 mmHg. - No abnormal decrease in systolic pressure and pulse amplitude during inspiration (paradoxical pulse) was detected. - Afebrile. - Cardiorespiratory auscultation rhythmic, without murmurs, tachycardic at 140 beats per minute (bpm), good bilateral vesicular murmur with slight bibasal crackles and left basal hypophonesis. - Abdomen soft and depressible, not painful on palpation and without visceromegaly. - Lower limbs with slight pretibial oedema. - The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  Complementary tests - Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus tachycardia at 146 bpm, low voltage and low R wave from V1 to V3. - Laboratory tests: biochemistry with normal ions and renal function. Haemogram with normocytic anaemia, normochromic (haemoglobin 8 g/dl), slight lymphopenia. Coagulation normal. - Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, slight left pleural effusion. - Transthoracic echocardiography: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with end-diastolic diameter (EDD) of 42 mm, slight concentric hypertrophy (12-13 mm). Generalised hypokinesia with severely depressed ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 30% measured by Simpson method in apical four chambers. Mild mitral insufficiency. Moderate-severe pericardial effusion (PD), circumferential, 1.9 - 2 cm, predominantly inferior, posterior and lateral LV. Extension to the free wall of the right ventricle (RV) and right atrium (RA), with partial collapse. In the diaphragmatic face, a 1.3 cm chamber was observed. No respiratory variations in valvular flows. Inferior vena cava with a diameter of 20 mm, without inspiratory collapse.  Clinical evolution Initially conservative management, with administration of serum therapy, transfusion of 2 red blood cell concentrates (the anaemia was initially related to the recent caesarean section) and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Elective pericardiocentesis was performed via the left parasternal route, draining 490 ml of serous fluid with biochemical characteristics of exudate and total debit of 790 ml. Low-dose beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were started, with good initial tolerance. Subsequently, he began with increased work of breathing and signs of pulmonary congestion, which led to the initiation of intravenous diuretics. Chest X-ray showed an increase in the amount of left pleural effusion, and diagnostic-therapeutic thoracentesis was performed, obtaining serous fluid. Poor clinical evolution, even initiating a pre-transplant study protocol. Control transthoracic echocardiography was performed, showing LV with severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 20-25%), in addition to severe RV systolic dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) grade II over IV and estimated pulmonary systolic pressure (PAPs) of 40 mmHg. Minimal PD. After a targeted re-examination of the patient, and faced with the need to make a differential diagnosis, she reported the appearance of skin lesions related to sun exposure over several years of evolution. This, together with the analytical data of normocytic normochromic anaemia, lymphopenia, febrile syndrome and pleuropericardial serositis, led us to suspect a possible outbreak of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with myocardial involvement as the aetiology. After further laboratory tests, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), positive anti-DNA, hypocomplementemia, moderate levels of anticardiolipin antibodies, hypergammagrobulinaemia, elevated LDH and positive Coombs test (sign of haemolytic anaemia) were obtained, which led to a definitive diagnosis of a lupus outbreak with expression of pancarditis and severe biventricular systolic dysfunction.  Diagnosis Lupus flare with expression of pancarditis, cardiac tamponade and severe biventricular systolic dysfunction. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Preferential appointment was requested for cardiac surgery. She was readmitted on 16 October 2011 due to chest pain with an ischaemic profile and decompensated heart failure in acute pulmonary oedema. He required NIMV and was admitted to the coronary ICU, being discharged to the cardiology ward after a good clinical evolution three days later. He presented an episode of AF with RVR reverting to RS after PC of amiodarone. ECG unchanged. Serial myocardial damage enzymes were normal. Echocardiography was repeated: severe AoS, peak gradient 69 mmHg, mean gradient 43 mmHg, peak velocity 4.2 m/s, gradients recorded in the right parasternal plane. Given the negative clinical evolution of the patient on the ward, a transfer to the Cardiac Surgery Department of his reference hospital was requested on 27 October.

We describe the case of a 25-year-old male patient admitted to the emergency department of our hospital. The patient was a resident of a rural area in contact with various farmyard animals, with a history of Down syndrome, severe mental retardation and chronic renal failure (left renal atrophy). He consulted for intermittent fever of 3 months' evolution, weight loss and nocturnal diaphoresis. In the last week, he became dyspnoeic, which is why his relatives decided to consult him.  Physical examination findings: blood pressure 120/80mmHg, heart rate 100lpm, respiratory rate 22min and oxygen saturation: 88%. Teeth in good condition, no jugular distension, no cervical lymphadenopathy. Systolic heart murmur grade 2/4 in mitral focus, as well as cramp in both lung bases. Abdomen without alterations. Oedema in the lower limbs, without skin lesions or neurological focalisation.  The initial diagnostic impression was sepsis of pulmonary origin. Treatment was started with piperacillin tazobactam 4.5g iv every 8h (after taking blood cultures) for 4 days.  Paraclinical tests showed normocytic normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin: 9g/dl) associated with thrombocytopenia (100,000/mm3), hypoalbuminaemia (3g/dl), microscopic haematuria, proteinuria and renal failure (creatinine: 1.6mg/dl), which led to glomerulonephritis; in addition, the chest X-ray and later a chest CT scan ruled out not only pulmonary infection, but also lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, although they showed signs of pulmonary congestion. Subsequently, the patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography, which showed: prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, with severe insufficiency and an image of 2.1×1.1cm in the distal third, compatible with endocardial vegetation.  Blood cultures taken on admission reported growth in the 2 bottles (19 and 20h incubation) of Gram-positive catalase-negative cocci, of which phenotypic identification of the species was performed in VITEK2® automated equipment (bioMérieux) as S. pluranimalium, with in vitro sensitivity to penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, linezolid, cefotaxime and vancomycin by the Kirby-Bauer method. Based on the modified Duke criteria1 , a diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made, meeting one major criterion (presence of vegetation on echocardiography) and four minor criteria (predisposing cardiac condition, fever, glomerulonephritis and positive blood cultures of a germ that did not meet the characteristics of the major criterion).  Because the patient had severe mitral insufficiency with signs and symptoms of heart failure, and the size of the vegetation was greater than 15mm, transfer to surgery for mitral valve replacement (biological valve) was considered. It should be noted that despite being a young patient, biological valve implantation was decided because the patient's social conditions (severe mental retardation and living in a rural area) made it very difficult for him to travel to attend anticoagulation check-ups. Control blood cultures were performed 8 days after the start of antibiotic therapy with no microbiological growth, and antibiotic treatment was completed with ampicillin sulbactam adjusted according to the sensitivity profile for up to 28 days, in accordance with the recommendation of the guidelines for the treatment of streptococcus. He did not receive gentamicin due to renal compromise. The patient was discharged without complications or sequelae. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Medical history and current illness 40-year-old male. Cardiovascular risk factors: untreated dyslipidaemia, smoking (30 cigarettes/day since the age of 18), obesity. Mother died of stroke at the age of 54. Uncomplicated peptic ulcus 15 years ago. She came to the emergency department for a transient loss of strength in the left hemibody lasting about 30 minutes with deviation of the corner of the mouth and falling to the floor, without loss of consciousness. In the last month she had presented 3 episodes of intense oppressive central thoracic pain, at rest, lasting 30 minutes and spontaneous cessation, for which she did not consult the doctor. Dyspnoea on moderate exertion in recent weeks.  Physical examination: BP 115/79 mmHg, HR 85 bpm, weight 100 kg, height 177 cm, BMI 32. Abdominal circumference 117, AC: rhythmic, minimal protosystolic murmur in the apex. AP: vesicular murmur preserved. Extremities: peripheral pulses present, symmetrical. Rest without relevant findings.  Complementary tests - Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 100 bpm. PR 200 ms. QRS 90 ms. Q wave in II, III and aVF. ST elevation 0.5 mm in III, aVF and V3. ST-segment elevation 0.5 mm in I, aVL, V5 to V6 with negative T wave in V2, isodiphasic in V3 and flattened from V4 to V6. - Transthoracic echocardiogram: severely dilated left ventricle, without hypertrophy and with severely depressed systolic function (ejection fraction 25%), with extensive alterations of segmental contractility in the inferior and anterior faces. Restrictive transmitral filling. Basal and apical inferior aneurysms. Apical intraventricular thrombus of 14x18 mm. Moderate ischaemic mitral insufficiency. - Laboratory tests: maximum troponin I 0.43 ng/dL, total cholesterol 223 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 31 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol 164 mg/dL, triglycerides 142 mg/dL. Basal blood glucose 88 mg/dL. HbA1c 4.9%. Normal haemogram, coagulation, renal function, ions, liver profile, iron profile and thyroid profile. - Cardiac catheterisation (coronary angiography): severe obstructive coronary artery disease of 3 main vessels, multi-segment, with suboptimal distal beds. - Cardiac MRI: dilated left ventricle, with severely depressed systolic function. Apical segments of anterior, inferior and septal face non-viable. Remaining segments viable. Apical thrombus. - Cardiac catheterisation (percutaneous coronary intervention): angioplasty and implantation of 3 drug-eluting stents on proximal and middle anterior descending artery, and angioplasty and implantation of 1 drug-eluting stent on obtuse marginal artery, with good angiographic results. In a second stage, angioplasty and implantation of 1 drug-eluting stent on the distal right coronary artery and posterior interventricular artery and 1 drug-eluting stent at the level of the crux, with good angiographic results.  Clinical course A 40-year-old man was admitted for a transient ischaemic attack in the right carotid artery and a history of chest pain. The diagnostic study revealed an evolved inferior and apical infarction, severe ventricular dysfunction and an intraventricular thrombus, three-vessel multisegment disease with suboptimal distal beds, and viability in the proximal and middle anterior descending and inferior territory. Given the poor distal quality of the anterior descending artery and the absence of diabetes mellitus, percutaneous revascularisation was chosen, and complete revascularisation was achieved with drug-eluting stents. The patient evolved favourably during admission, with no clinical signs of heart failure or new neurological focality.  Diagnosis - Ischaemic heart disease: advanced inferior and apical infarction - Obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease of three main vessels - Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction - Apical intraventricular thrombus - Transient ischaemic attack due to cardioembolism - Complete percutaneous revascularisation with drug-eluting stents - Dyslipidaemia - Smoking - Obesity |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Medical history and current illness 61-year-old male, ex-smoker of 10 cigarettes a day for 5 years, hypertensive and dyslipidaemic under pharmacological treatment. He denied a family history of heart disease. A sister of his had only one kidney since birth and a niece had been diagnosed with polysplenia since childhood. Cardiologically, he had been diagnosed 5 years ago with dilated cardiomyopathy in the context of a routine medical check-up, being completely asymptomatic, NYHA functional class I. He had a history of dilated cardiomyopathy. It was a dilated cardiomyopathy with moderate left ventricular dysfunction, with normal coronary arteries and associated mild aortic stenosis and moderate MI due to P2 prolapse. He was asymptomatic and under medical treatment until four years after diagnosis, when, following the onset of moderate exertional dyspnoea, an echocardiogram was performed which revealed severe MR. He underwent surgery with Carpentier mitral annuloplasty. After 3 months, he was readmitted for heart failure with moderate MR that became severe on stress echocardiography. At that time, reintervention was discouraged given the history of previous surgery and the presence of severe ventricular dysfunction. After three months he fell into AF, which could not be cardioverted chemically or electrically, so he was anticoagulated and managed with rate control. He was referred for evaluation of cardiac transplantation.  Complementary tests - ECG: AF and a ventricular response at 80 bpm with a narrow QRS were observed. - Chest X-ray: increased CTI with no evidence of pulmonary congestion. The blood test showed an NTproBNP of 14000, with no other findings of interest. Serology was positive for Toxoplasma IgG and CMV IgG and negative for hepatitis virus and HIV. He had a positive anti-lymphocyte antibody panel of 20%. - Echocardiogram: a dilated LV with an EF of 25%, moderate-severe MR and severe low-gradient aortic stenosis that had not been described in previous echocardiograms (AVA 0.5 cm2; mean gradient 20) with contractile reserve was described. - Ergometry with gas consumption: estimated VO2 PEAK of 8.5 ml/kg/min (20% of the maximum theoretical value). Weber-Janicki functional class: D. In the 6-minute test he performed 320 metres without stopping or desaturation. - Right catheterisation: showed a PCP of 32, a PAP 68/32/44, and a cardiac index of 2.6 l/min/m2. - Screening with thoracoabdominal CT (with a view to probable cardiac transplantation): showed polysplenia, hepatic and splenic inversion and anomalies in venous drainage (left superior vena cava draining into the coronary sinus; absence of vena cava above the renal veins, draining the entire infrahepatic venous system directly into the right superior vena cava via the azygos system.  Clinical course Without complications during admission, the case was discussed in a medical-surgical session. Aortic and mitral prosthesis surgery was considered an excessive risk and the patient was accepted as a candidate for heart transplant on the elective list.  Diagnosis - Chronic heart failure in advanced NYHA functional class III, with evidence of poor prognosis - Dilated cardiomyopathy of probable valvular origin - Carpentier annuloplasty one year ago - Recurrence of severe MI and current severe aortic stenosis - Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction - Pending decision to be placed on elective cardiac transplant waiting list Polysplenia, hepatic inversion, situs sólitus - Left superior vena cava and venous drainage anomalies - Previous |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical history and current disease A 22-year-old Brazilian national who had been living in our country for 2 years, with a personal history of long-standing arterial hypertension treated with amlodipine, dyslipidaemia, tonsillitis resolved with antibiotherapy, mild bilateral hypoacusis of unknown aetiology and left thoracic herpes zoster. He had been diagnosed with chronic renal failure of unknown aetiology in another hospital for two years, when he had an episode of acute pulmonary oedema in the context of renal failure with glomerular filtration rate of 3 ml/min/1.73 m2, requiring urgent haemodialysis. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed normal cardiac cavities, left ventricle (LV) with eccentric hypertrophy and preserved biventricular systolic function. Since then, he has been on haemodialysis. He was referred to our centre a year ago to assess living donor renal transplantation. The echocardiogram performed as a pre-transplant protocol showed biventricular dilatation and severe dysfunction of both ventricles. On admission, intense cutaneous pallor, cutaneous-mucosal subictericia. Afebrile. BP 120/70 mmHg. There was an arteriovenous fistula with large debit in the right upper extremity. The patient reported usual functional class III/IV NYHA, with episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, decubitus cough and orthopnoea in recent weeks. Given the haemodynamic situation of heart failure, he was admitted to our care for study. On auscultation, rhythmic tones at 90 bpm, with gallop and systolic murmur in mitral focus. Bilateral normoventilation. Hepatomegaly of 1-2 finger widths, painful on palpation. Malleolar oedema with fovea. No carotid murmurs. Signs of peripheral hypoperfusion.  Complementary tests - Laboratory tests on admission: proBNP of 547,000 pg/ml, glomerular filtration rate of 18 mL/min/1.73 m2 and anaemia with haemoglobin of 10 g/dl and haematocrit of 30%. - ECG: sinus rhythm with left ventricular enlargement and unspecific repolarisation alterations. - Chest X-ray: severe cardiomegaly. Vascular redistribution and bilateral pleural effusion. - Serology: positive for hepatitis A virus, varicella-zoster, herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus and Ebstein-Barr virus. - Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): showed severely dilated LV (end-diastolic diameter 73 mm), global hypocontractility with ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, cardiac output (CO) 3.67 L/min, elevated preload criteria. Right ventricle (RV) moderately dilated and frankly hypocontractile. Moderate mitral insufficiency (MI). Severe tricuspid insufficiency (TI). Dilated suprahepatic veins and inferior vena cava without inspiratory collapse. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 45 mmHg. Severe pericardial effusion, with no evidence of haemodynamic compromise. - Coronary angiography: coronary tree free of angiographically evident lesions. - Ventriculography: severely dilated LV, LVEF 20% and end-diastolic pressure of 25 mmHg. - Right catheterisation: mean right atrial pressure 11 mmHg, systolic PAP 50 mmHg and mean 37 mmHg. Cardiac output 6.42 L/min. Mean pulmonary capillary pressure 30 mmHg, with 'V' wave up to 45-50 mmHg. - Thoracoabdominal CT: bilateral pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites and stasis liver, all related to heart failure.  Clinical evolution During admission to our department, daily haemodialysis sessions were started, with progressive improvement in his haemodynamic situation. The cardiological situation was re-evaluated and a slight left ventricular improvement was observed, but with persistent dilatation and severe RV dysfunction and no findings of specific aetiology. Therefore, the patient was proposed for cardiorenal transplantation, and after a favourable evolution, he was discharged. During follow-up, hypovolaemia with hypotension made it necessary to reduce the frequency of haemodialysis sessions to 6 days a week and to reduce pharmacological treatment. He presented with a catarrhal episode with associated febrile syndrome, for which a chest X-ray was performed showing slight cardiomegaly, so a TTE was performed which showed a slight reduction in LV diameter with discrete improvement in systolic function. Six months after hospital discharge, he was readmitted as a transplant recipient and his initial evaluation showed a drastic reduction in radiological cardiomegaly since his last check-up, so a TTE was performed which showed significant improvement: LV with a DTD of 49 mm, global hypokinesia with LVEF of 30%, minimal TR allowing calculation of PAPs of 32 mmHg. In view of the findings, it was decided to perform an isolated renal transplant procedure, which took place without incident. During this admission, no inotropic drugs were required and there was no LV failure. On discharge TTE, systolic function improved (LVEF 34%), with moderate concentric hypertrophy, CO 3.8 l/min and RV slightly dilated and normocontractile. At present, the patient is in NYHA functional class I. Subsequent follow-up showed progressive clinical improvement and improvement in echocardiographic parameters. Good nephrological evolution.

Clinical history and current disease 27-year-old male patient with a history of nephrotic syndrome due to focal and segmental hyalinosis diagnosed at 4 years of age. He was treated with peritoneal dialysis until 1998, when he was transplanted. In 2007 he presented chronic rejection and recurrence of hyalinosis; therefore, in 2008 he underwent embolisation of the renal graft and restarted peritoneal dialysis again until the present day. Severe pericardial effusion in 2008 of uraemic aetiology. One year ago total thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma of follicular pattern, with foci in both thyroid lobes and micrometastasis in one lymph node of the 23 isolated lymph nodes; she subsequently received treatment with radioactive iodine. Clinical picture of 48 hours of evolution consisting of progressive dyspnoea and asthenia. Physical examination on admission: patient alert, conscious, oriented, tachypneic and intolerant to decubitus. BP: 85/46 HR: 128 bpm FR: 28 Afebrile SaO2: 92% with nasal goggles. Head and neck: jugular ingurgitation at 45o. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic and regular, with diminished intensity. Lung fields well ventilated, without over-aggregate sounds. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful. Extremities with present and symmetrical pulses, grade I/IV malleolar oedema.  Complementary tests - CBC: leukocytes 6,600 with adequate differential count, Hb 8.7, haematocrit 26%, MCV 79.5, MCH 26.6, platelets 214,000, Act. PT 71.7%, aTTP 30.42, glucose 109 mg/dl, urea 74, creatinine 6.8, total protein 4.2. Ions and cardiac enzymes within normal limits. - ECG: sinus tachycardia at 128 bpm, decreased voltages. - Chest X-ray: significant increase in cardiothoracic index. Right costophrenic sinus pinched, left costophrenic sinus not visible by the cardiac silhouette. - TT echocardiography: pericardial effusion with maximum diameters in end-diastole of up to 4 cm and signs of haemodynamic compromise.  Clinical evolution The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and evacuating pericardiocentesis was performed after superficial sedation with echo-guided propofol. Given the high possibility of pericardial effusion of probable uraemic aetiology, it was notable that after uncomplicated puncture the drainage fluid had a significant haematic component, so it was decided to perform an echocardiographic test with agitated serum through a catheter needle to check the correct location; bubbles were clearly observed in the pericardial space. After drainage of 600 cc, an increase in blood pressure was observed, but he remained tachycardic and presented desaturation requiring O2 supply with a reservoir. Chest X-ray after puncture showed complete veiling of the left hemithorax, in addition to an evident interstitial pattern in the right hemithorax compared to the previous X-ray. An urgent chest CT scan was requested with findings of opacification of the left upper lobe with air bronchogram suggestive of atelectasis, alveolar oedema and moderate bilateral pleural effusion (31 mm thick in the right base and 25 mm in the left base) which surrounds the atelectasized parenchyma at the level of the left apex; severe circumferential pericardial effusion which at the left posterolateral level reaches up to 5 cm in thickness; pericardial catheter located anterior to the right ventricular outflow tract. The patient was treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and diuretics, obtaining a rapid clinical response with progressive re-expansion of the left upper lobe and clear improvement of the radiological signs of heart failure, until respiratory stability and O2 saturations of 99% were obtained with nasal goggles. Total pericardial drainage was 1800 cc. The fluid study showed red blood cells of 800000/mm3 and other parameters within normal limits, with no bacteria in the gram, negative cultures for aerobes and anaerobes; and negative for malignant cells in the pathological anatomy study.  Diagnosis - Severe pericardial effusion with signs of haemodynamic compromise in a patient with chronic kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis - Alveolar oedema and pleural effusion ex vacuo secondary to pericardiocentesis - Left upper lobe atelectasis secondary to sedation |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical history and current illness A 66-year-old man came to the emergency department for progressive dyspnoea after a respiratory infection. No known cardiovascular risk factors. No toxic habits. Under study for probable OSA. Cataract surgery years ago without complications. The patient came to the emergency department of our centre for progressive exertional dyspnoea of one week's evolution, following a lower respiratory tract infection with cough and greenish expectoration. There was no documented fever, although there was a feeling of dystrophy during the first few days of the episode. No other symptoms. Physical examination: 37.6 oC, BP: 140/50 mmHg, HR: 100 bpm. Pulse was clear, no signs of jugular venous engorgement. AP: crackles in both bases, hypophonesis in right base. AC: rhythmic tones, aortic regurgitant diastolic murmur grade 3/6. Abdomen without alterations. No oedema in the lower limbs.  Complementary tests The following complementary tests were performed: - ECG: sinus rhythm at 95 bpm. Normal PR segment. Signs of left ventricular enlargement. Left anterior hemiblock. No repolarisation alterations. - CBC: normal haemogram, basic biochemistry and normal ions. - Chest X-ray: signs of vascular redistribution, interstitial oedema in lower fields and bilateral pleural effusion, predominantly on the right. No apparent parenchymal infiltrates. - Transthoracic echocardiogram: dilated left ventricle with end-diastolic diameter of 65 mm and end-systolic diameter of 40 mm, with hyperdynamic global systolic function. An aortic insufficiency jet was detected, which was difficult to quantify as it was an eccentric jet that collided with the anterior mitral leaflet, and was suggestive of significant aortic insufficiency. Absence of mitral valve disease. Normal right chambers with pulmonary systolic pressure not estimable in the absence of tricuspid insufficiency, with no indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension. No vegetations or other signs of endocarditis visible by this technique, no other pathological findings. - Blood cultures (x2) in two batches taken, one before and one after the start of antibiotic treatment: negative Clinical evolution Treatment was started with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in addition to antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with excellent clinical evolution. Following clinical improvement, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to evaluate the cause of the aortic regurgitation. This test documented severe aortic regurgitation due to severe prolapse (flail) of one of the valve leaflets, causing an eccentric jet directed towards the anterior mitral leaflet. Slope of the jet of very pronounced aortic insufficiency and holodiastolic inversion of the flow in the descending aorta, compatible with severe aortic insufficiency. Other findings superimposed on those reported in the transthoracic echocardiogram.  Diagnosis Heart failure triggered by respiratory infection, in a patient with severe aortic valve disease (severe aortic insufficiency due to flail of one of the leaflets). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Medical history and current illness - 62 year old woman - Active life - No known drug allergies - Smoker of 0.5 packs of tobacco/day - Obesity grade 2 - No high blood pressure - No diabetes - Hypercholesterolemia - Hypothyroidism - Chronic venous insufficiency - Severe dorso-lumbar scoliosis - No cardiological history - Home treatment: lyrica, pitavastatin, furosemide, daflon, voltaren, levothroid  Complementary tests - Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm. Old inferior necrosis. PR 171 msec. QRS 86 msec. QTc 413 msec. Cardiac axis 60o. - Chest X-ray on admission: cardiomegaly, increased bilateral interstitial tissue with bibasal predominance. - Blood tests on admission: glucose 150 mg/dl, urea 90 mg/dl, creatinine 3.3 mg/dl, sodium 138 mMol/l, potassium 4.4 mMol/l, INR 1.21, aPTT 25.8, leukocytes 42900/ul, PMN 95.1%, lymphocytes 2000/ul, keys 13%, haemoglobin 9.9 g/dl, haematocrit 30.3%, MCV 88.7, MHC 28.9, platelets 16000/uL. - Cranial CT scan on admission: poorly demarcated right frontal hypodense lesion. - Brain MRI: multiple brain lesions with fine annular enhancement and perilesional oedema, the largest measuring 2 cm in diameter, located in the right frontal lobe and both occipital lobes, compatible with brain abscesses. - Transthoracic echocardiogram on admission: cardiac cavities not dilated. Preserved left ventricular function. Mitral valve with calcification in the posterior annulus, sclerosis and thickening of the posterior leaflet in which a mobile hyperechoic image was observed adhered to the free edge, without being able to rule out vegetation, leading to mild-moderate mitral insufficiency. No other significant valvulopathies. No pericardial effusion. - Transesophageal echocardiogram on admission: two images were observed at the level of the posterior leaflets (1.4x1.3 cm) and anterior mitral leaflets (0.8x0.9 cm) suggestive of vegetation. Moderate mitral insufficiency. - Control echocardiogram: colour Doppler image suggestive of perforation of the posterior mitral leaflet. The vegetation in the posterior leaflet was observed to have disappeared. Image in the anterior leaflet suggestive of evolved vegetation. Moderate mitral insufficiency. - Abdominal ultrasound: medical renal disease with parenchymal scarring. Splenic infarcts. Thrombosis of the celiac trunk. - Blood cultures on admission: positive for Sth. Aureus sensitive to cloxacillin. - Control blood cultures: negative.  Clinical evolution Patient initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in septic shock, with acute oliguric renal failure, requiring volume support and vasoactive amines and a brain lesion of uncertain aetiology. There were no septic foci detectable at abdominal level by CT scan, but a transthoracic echocardiogram showed a suspicious image of vegetation on the mitral valve, which was confirmed by transesophageal echocardiogram. There was also evidence of preserved systolic function and moderate mitral insufficiency. Treated on admission with meropenem, once diagnosed with mitral endocarditis, treatment was started with vancomycin and gentamicin. After the initial blood cultures were positive for cloxacillin-sensitive Sthaphylococcus aureus, the antibiotic regimen was changed to cloxacillin-gentamicin. The study was completed with brain MRI, which confirmed the presence of several lesions compatible with brain abscesses, all of them smaller than 2 cm. After an initial favourable evolution, the patient was transferred to the cardiology ward for further treatment. On admission to the ward, the patient showed signs of global heart failure, with optimal response to diuretics. In the first few days, she also developed septic embolism in the left lower limb. An urgent transfemoral embolectomy was performed, which was successful. Abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of several splenic infarctions and an image of an embolus at the level of the celiac trunk (the patient did not present intestinal symptoms at any time), which were not present in the previous abdominal CT scan. Control echocardiograms showed a reduction in the size of the vegetation, persistence of moderate insufficiency, preserved function. Continuing prolonged therapy with cloxacillin for eight weeks, due to the presence of brain abscesses, the patient experienced progressive clinical improvement and improvement of analytical parameters, with disappearance of data suggestive of active infection, normalisation of renal function parameters, remaining afebrile and stable. The case was discussed in a medical-surgical session, at which time the patient had emboligenic mitral endocarditis with brain abscesses, chronic anaemia, renal insufficiency with GFR around 30 ml/min. Given the high surgical risk and the favourable response to antibiotic treatment, it was decided to continue with medical management, and mitral valve replacement surgery was not ruled out in the event of a progression of the infectious condition. Once the antibiotic regimen was completed, and given the clinical and haemodynamic stability, discharge home was decided.  Diagnosis - Endocarditis on native mitral valve, due to Sthaphylococcus aureus sensitive to cloxacillin, emboligenic. Septic shock - Preserved systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Perforation of posterior leaflet of mitral valve - Renal failure of mixed aetiology (nephrotoxic, glomerulonephritis, prerenal) - Congestive heart failure - Cerebral septic embolism. Cerebral abscesses smaller than 2 cm - Femoral arterial septic embolism. Urgent transfemoral embolectomy - Asymptomatic celiac trunk embolism - Splenic embolism with infarction |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The proximal CX lesion is then predilated and an everolimus-eluting drug-eluting stent (3*18 mm at 18 atm) is implanted with good final angiographic results.    CLINICAL EVOLUTION A 71-year-old man was admitted for unstable angina. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed preserved biventricular systolic function and no valvular heart disease. A coronary angiogram was also performed, showing occlusion of the ostial anterior descending artery (already known), a significant lesion in the distal trunk affecting the circumflex ostium and a severe distal lesion. A mild iron deficiency anaemia was found, which is why, after discussing the case in the medical-surgical session, an anaemia study was indicated to exclude bleeding foci prior to percutaneous intervention. Telemetry showed ventricular bigeminy, which was jugulated with beta-blockers; no major ventricular arrhythmias. Digestive endoscopy was performed without documentation of potentially bleeding lesions. The patient under double antiplatelet therapy and low weight heparins has not presented clinical bleeding and has improved ferrokinetics and haemoglobin with oral iron. Excluding major bleeding and without anaemia under double antiplatelet therapy plus heparin, the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with implantation of two stents with a good final angiographic result. Post-procedural evolution was favourable, with no clinical events. Given her clinical stability, with no further in-hospital procedures required, she was discharged home.

Cardiological history of interest: chronic ischaemic heart disease. Coronary artery disease of the left coronary trunk (LMCA) and 3 vessels surgically revascularised in 1992 (AMII-DA and AMID-OM). Admitted for unstable angina in 2010, with 90% disease of LMCA, occlusion of LMAD and occlusion of CXp and CDp; permeable bridges, so it was decided to indicate medical treatment. Last coronary angiography in April/2014 due to stable angina CCS III with positive exercise echocardiogram for extensive global ischaemia, implantation of drug-eluting stents on LMCA was performed with good results (same coronary anatomy, permeable bridges). Persistent atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response. CHADSVASc score 4.  Other relevant background: Stable bronchial asthma under follow-up in pulmonology. Spirometry performed in 2014: FVC 3840 (100%), FEV1 2610 (98%), index 71, negative bronchodilator test. Stage 3 chronic renal failure secondary to probable nephroangiosclerosis. Secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary chronic anaemia. Hyperuricaemia. Benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Surgical interventions: cholecystectomy. Functional status: dyspnoea NYHA functional class II. Stable angina CCS I. Retired taxi driver, occasionally works as a carpenter.

CURRENT ILLNESS 77-year-old patient admitted to the pulmonology department in January/2015 with clinical manifestations of cough with haemoptotic expectoration and increased dyspnoea, afebrile. Initially managed with outpatient levofloxacin. Given the torpid evolution, he was transferred to the emergency department, where a chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, especially in the upper lobes. After 15 days on antibiotics, oxygen therapy, corticosteroids and diuretics, the clinical symptoms subsided and he was discharged in January 2015. During admission, an autoimmune and infectious study was performed with negative results, and a thoracic CT scan showed ground glass images in the upper lobes suggestive of pulmonary haemorrhage. Bronchoscopy was performed with hyperemic mucosa with no evidence of active bleeding, with bronchoaspirate with haemosiderophages (30% of macrophages with ferric material with positive Perls staining) and on discharge he was diagnosed with alveolar haemorrhage of probable infectious aetiology. He was admitted again in February 2015 from the outpatient pulmonology department as an emergency due to dyspnoea on slight exertion, orthopnoea and a new episode of haemoptysis. A new chest X-ray was performed showing cardiomegaly, data suggestive of heart failure and right basal infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia, afebrile, and a new hospital admission was decided.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 141/72 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 75 bpm, SatO2 92% with FiO2 30%. Tachypnoea at rest. Good general condition. CBC: minimal IVY at 45 ̊. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic, aortic systolic murmur 3/6 with decreased R2; Gallavardin phenomenon. Pulmonary auscultation: bilateral wet crackles. Abdomen: soft, depressible, non-painful. Lower limbs: perimalleolar oedema. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: atrial fibrillation at 75 bpm. Lateral ST rectification. CBC: haemogram: white blood cells 6.08 x10^9/l. Haematocrit 27.6%. Haemoglobin 9.1 g/dl. Platelets 289 x10^9/l. Biochemistry: glucose 90 mg/dl. Urea 57 mg/dl. Creatinine 1.33 mg/dl. Sodium 139 mmol/l. Potassium 4.3 mmol/l, ESR 1 hour 65 mm. NT-proBNP 4700 pg/ml. Chest X-ray: increased cardiopericardial silhouette. Vascular redistribution, bilateral perihilar oedema and minimal right pleural effusion. Right basal consolidation. Control chest X-ray: significant radiological improvement, with resolution of the right basal infiltrate. Bilateral alveolar infiltrates persist. Coronary angiography: no changes with respect to the previous study. Aorto-iliac axes not suitable for percutaneous prosthesis implantation (severe tortuosity in the right axis, ulcerated plaque in the left common iliac). Echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) of normal size. Moderate concentric wall thickening. Preserved LV systolic function (LVEF > 55%). LA moderately dilated (49 mm). RV slightly dilated (45 mm) with preserved RVSF. Normal mitral valve with central 1/4 mitral regurgitation. Normal appearing tricuspid valve, central 2/4 IT with mild pulmonary hypertension (PH). Sclerocalcified aortic valve, with severe aortic stenosis (Vmax 4.5 m/s, mean gradient 40 mmHg, aortic valve area 0.78 cm2, TVI ratio 0.23); aortic regurgitation 2/4 central. Normal sized IVC with collapse > 50%. No pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram monitoring transapical TAVI implantation: Baseline TEE: slightly calcified aortic valve with severe stenosis and central insufficiency grade 2/4. Aortic annulus 2.75 cm2 (2D: 18 mm, 3D diameters 17.5x18 mm). Aortic valve annulus-ICD ostium distance 11.8 mm. Mitral valve insufficiency grade 1/4. Tricuspid valve insufficiency grade 2/4. Normal LV systolic function (LVEF > 55%). No pericardial effusion. Intervention: implantation of a 23 mm SAPIEN 3 prosthesis via transapical route. Post-implantation TEE: well-positioned, normofunctioning biological aortic valve prosthesis, with trivial periprosthetic insufficiency. Normal LV systolic function. Rest unchanged with respect to the previous study.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION This is a patient with repeated admissions for haemoptysis with migratory pulmonary infiltrates and examination data suggestive of decompensation of heart failure, as well as elevated natriuretic peptide levels, with good clinical-radiological evolution in the various admissions with diuretic treatment. The complementary tests performed were suggestive of alveolar haemorrhage (although the bronchoscopy showed no evidence of active bleeding, it was performed in a stable clinical situation after resolution of the haemoptysis, showing haemosiderin-laden macrophages with no evidence of active infection), the substrate of which seems to be decompensation of heart failure in the context of severe aortic stenosis. In view of these findings, the case was discussed with cardiology, and the case was presented at a medical-surgical session, and a decision was made to replace the aortic valve. Given the EuroScore of 7.3%, percutaneous replacement by femoral access was initially considered, but was ruled out after angiography in which inadequate aorto-iliac axes were observed. For this reason, it was decided to implant the prosthesis via transapical access. On 24/02/2015, a 23 mm Edwards SAPIEN 3 biological prosthesis was implanted under echocardiographic monitoring. After the intervention he was transferred to the coronary ICU, being extubated a few hours later without complications. He remained in the CICU for 48 hours with good clinical evolution, requiring transfusion of three red blood cell concentrates and slight deterioration of renal function, and was transferred to the cardiac surgery ward. During his stay on the cardiac surgery ward he evolved favourably without complications and was discharged after 7 days. Since then, the patient has been under active follow-up in cardiology consultations with no new admissions for haemoptysis or decompensation of heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status I-II, with control echocardiograms showing preserved systolic function and a normofunctioning prosthesis with trivial periprosthetic insufficiency.   DIAGNOSIS Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis with heart failure decompensation. Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage secondary to heart failure. Transapical aortic valve replacement with biological prosthesis Edward Sapien 3 No23. Normofunctioning prosthesis at follow-up. Preserved systolic function. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild PH. Stable chronic ischaemic heart disease. LMCA and 3-vessel disease revascularised surgically (IAMI-AD, IAMI-OM in 1997) and percutaneously (stent implantation in LMCA-AD in 2013). Permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) anticoagulated with pradaxa. Cardiovascular risk factors: HBP.

Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. Bilateral pleural effusion. Pulmonary vasculation in relation to pulmonary oedema. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): left ventricle with concentric hypertrophy (septum 12 mm), abnormal septal motion with septal akinesia and moderately affected global systolic function. LA of 17.3 cm2. Valve prosthesis in aortic position poorly visualised, with severe regurgitation (THP 160ms) and obtaining a max gradient of 94 mmHg (mean 59 mmHg). Fibrocalcified mitral valve mostly posteriorly with at least moderate regurgitation (grade III), reaching the atrial roof. Normal sized right chambers with TAPSE of 12 mm and moderate TR with a calculated PsAP of 32 mmHg + PVC. No pericardial effusion. IVC of 18 mm with inspiratory collapse < 50%. Transesophageal echocardiogram: metallic prosthesis in aortic position with very reduced disc mobility, low echogenic density material is observed at disc level. Severe stenosis with velocities greater than 5 ms/s and severe insufficiency. Moderate mitral insufficiency. Left ventricle (LV) not dilated, mild hypertrophy, moderately impaired systolic function. Non-dilated right ventricle (RV) with normal function.  CLINICAL COURSE The patient is a 76-year-old woman admitted with acute pulmonary oedema. Emergent TTE was performed and showed a moderately affected left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency secondary to dysfunction of the mechanical aortic valve prosthesis. Given his history of previous surgery with under-therapeutic doses of anticoagulation, acute-subacute prosthetic thrombosis was suspected on admission as the main aetiology. For this reason, a TEE study was completed which led to this diagnosis. Medical treatment was started with intravenous diuretics. The patient evolved unfavourably and was haemodynamically unstable, requiring vasoactive support, so given the situation of cardiogenic shock, emergency aortic valve replacement surgery was decided. Emergent surgery was performed, in which a St Jude aortic prosthesis no 19 blocked by the presence of two small clots of less than 5 mm in both hinges was visualised. The prosthesis was explanted and the annulus was enlarged with a pericardial patch in the non-coronary leaflet towards the mitral annulus in order to implant the Magna Ease No 19 biological prosthesis. He presented with an episode of ventricular fibrillation that reverted after defibrillation, so it was decided to re-enter CPB and implant intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) via the right femoral artery with insufficient haemodynamic response and severe left ventricular dysfunction; finally it was decided to implant a peripheral femoro-femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO). Poor evolution during the days following surgery, in a situation of cardiogenic shock refractory to maximum support measures, evolving towards multi-organ failure, finally dying.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure in a situation of acute pulmonary oedema.

HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 54-year-old woman from Paraguay. She had a history of arterial hypertension treated with diuretics and a probable episode of pulmonary embolism for which she had received anticoagulant treatment in 2013, which the patient described imprecisely. She remained asymptomatic after this episode. However, 4 months prior to the current admission, she began to present symptoms of progressive dyspnoea until she became resting, oedema in the lower limbs and a weight loss of 10 kg, for which reason she consulted a cardiologist in Paraguay. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate pulmonary hypertension (PSAP 55 mmHg), severe tricuspid insufficiency (TI) and a dilated right ventricle with normal function (TAPSE 24 mm). For this reason, he was prescribed treatment with spironolactone 25 mg, furosemide 40 mg and carvedilol 12.5 mg every 12 hours. At that time, thyroid hormone tests were not performed, although they were recommended, because her health insurance did not cover such tests. A few months later she travelled to Spain on holiday, presenting with diarrhoea for 3 days and colicky abdominal pain, for which reason she went to the emergency department of our centre. On arrival, he presented evident signs of heart failure, predominantly right-sided, with oedema in the legs, jugular ingurgitation and dyspnoea at rest with paradoxical breathing and supraclavicular tugging, for which the coronary unit was notified. On admission to the coronary unit he had a blood pressure of 137/47 mmHg and heart rate of 42 bpm (in the absence of beta-blockers), temperature of 36 ̊C and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination revealed marked jugular engorgement, a jugular venous pulse with oscillating stop at 5 cm from the angle of Louis and Kussmaull's sign. In addition, a large goitre with palpable thrill and a continuous thyroid murmur, not irradiated and accompanied by bilateral exophthalmos, was documented. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed palpation of the right ventricle in the right parasternal region, as well as a tricuspid regurgitation murmur. On pulmonary auscultation, the vesicular murmur was abolished in both lung bases. The patient also showed hepatomegaly 3 cm below the costal margin and oedema with fovea up to the root of the lower limbs. After diuretic treatment the signs of congestion improved and bilateral pretibial oedema without fovea compatible with myxoedema could be observed.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a nodal rhythm at 42 bpm, with low voltages in the limb leads and diffusely flattened T's in all leads. Chest X-ray showed right pleural effusion, with deflected hilarity and enlarged cardiac silhouette. At this time, an emergency portable transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing severe right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction and severe PH (estimated PSAP of 60 mmHg), together with severe tricuspid regurgitation and evidence of peripheral congestion. The patient was admitted under initial suspicion of chronic pulmonary embolism as the origin of the condition. Anticoagulant and intravenous diuretic treatment was started, which resulted in large negative balances and clinical improvement. Analyses showed anaemia (Hb 8.8 g/dl), thrombopenia (93,000 platelets/mcl), cholestasis without hepatic cytolysis (GGT 95 IU; alkaline phosphatase 223 IU, total bilirubin 1.9 mg/dl, normal GOT and GPT and spontaneous INR of 1.7), all compatible with a stasis liver. Impaired renal function (Cr 1.7 mg/dl), hyponatraemia (Na 127) and hyperkalaemia (K 6.4), markedly elevated NT-proBNP values (11,617 pg/ml) were also documented. D-dimer levels were also elevated 2,400 ng/ml. Antibody tests (ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-glomerular basement membrane, c-ANCA and p-ANCA, anti-beta2 glycoprotein, anticardiolipin) and serology (HIV, HCV, HBV, syphilis) were also negative. Ultrasound scans of the lower limbs and abdomen ruled out the presence of deep vein thrombosis and revealed ascites and liver stasis, respectively. Given the apparent chronic nature of the condition, and the deterioration of renal function, a ventilation/perfusion scan was requested (instead of CT angiography of the pulmonary arteries), with the aim of establishing the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary embolism. The result of the test was inconclusive, so pending a definitive diagnosis, anticoagulant treatment was maintained. Computed tomography was not performed as a first choice due to the deterioration of renal function. Once anticoagulant and diuretic therapy had been started, we obtained the following thyroid hormone results: undetectable TSH, T3L 15.79 mlU/l and T4L 59.20 mlU/l. Given these results, the patient was referred to the endocrinology department, who considered the condition to be primary autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves-Basedow disease) with secondary hypoaldosteronism and cytopenias, as the first diagnostic possibility. Treatment was started with antithyroid drugs (thiamazole), beta-blockers (propranolol) and corticosteroids (dexamethasone). The results of antithyroid antibodies were positive. During admission, the patient presented, after the first 72 hours, with a fever of 38 ̊C related to bacteraemia due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, which was treated with a 10-day course of antibiotherapy with cloxacillin. After completing the course, he again developed fever and retrocardiac pulmonary infiltrate with sputum positive for Rothia mucilaginosa. He was treated with levofloxacin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin with good response and satisfactory resolution of the infectious picture. Once renal function improved, a chest CT scan was performed which definitively ruled out the presence of lung embolism, highlighting the dilatation of the right heart cavities and the presence of significant right pleural effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After one month of antithyroid treatment, a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which showed complete normalisation of both the function and size of the right ventricle. Normalisation of pulmonary pressure and the presence of minimal tricuspid regurgitation were also documented. The patient was finally discharged once the alterations at the right ventricular level and in the pulmonary circulation had resolved with correction of the significant thyroid disorder. Our patient presented a complete resolution of cardiopulmonary symptoms after normalisation of thyroid hormone levels.  DIAGNOSIS Right predominant heart failure. Severe right ventricular dysfunction and severe tricuspid regurgitation in the context of pulmonary hypertension. Severe pulmonary hypertension secondary to primary autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves-Basedow disease). Primary autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves-Basedow disease). Acute renal failure. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Stool parasites: negative.  CLINICAL COURSE A 61-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy of ischaemic aetiology consulted the emergency department for asthenia, anorexia, jaundice, choluria and acholia of one week's evolution, associated with thermometric fever of up to 37.9 ̊C. Analysis on arrival revealed elevated transaminases and a marked increase in the cholestasis profile with hyperbilirubinaemia at the expense of direct bilirubin, as well as leukocytosis and eosinophilia together with elevated acute phase reactants and coagulopathy, with an INR of 25, requiring the administration of 1 ampoule of vitamin K for correction. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine department to complete the aetiological study of the condition, and all medication was withdrawn except for aspirin and clopidogrel, replacing acenocoumarol treatment with enoxaparin. To this end, serology for hepatotropic viruses, determination of parasites in faeces and immunology tests were carried out, all of which were negative. Imaging studies were also carried out by abdominal ultrasound and cholangio-MRI, which only revealed the presence of lymphadenopathies in the hepatic hilar and celiac region, without content or dilatation at the level of the biliary tree. Having ruled out an infectious, autoimmune or obstructive aetiology, a systematic review of the literature was carried out and cases of idiosyncratic hepatitis secondary to the administration of statins were found. The allergology and gastroenterology departments were consulted and confirmed the diagnosis of suspected idiosyncratic hepatitis, recommending definitive discontinuation of statin treatment and reintroduction of the rest of the treatment that had been withdrawn on admission. With regard to the subsequent evolution, the patient presented a resolution of the cytolysis profile and normalisation of eosinophilia within 8 days of withdrawal of atorvastatin; he persisted with a discrete elevation of the cholestasis pattern at discharge. Clinically, the patient experienced a marked improvement, with resolution of abdominal symptoms, as well as resolution of choluria and acholia. In relation to the above, and given that the patient had high LDL cholesterol levels (LDL 174 mg/dl), he was referred to the lipid unit of our centre in order to consider the use of PCSK9 inhibitors, and was assessed 1 month later, with transaminase and cytolysis enzyme levels within normal limits in control analyses. From the cardiovascular point of view, a control echocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging were performed during admission, showing persistent severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 25%), with anteroseptal akinesia and apical aneurysm. For this reason, treatment for ventricular dysfunction was progressively introduced with enalapril, eplerenone and metoprolol, with adequate tolerance, and ICD implantation was performed as primary prevention 40 days after the acute event.    DIAGNOSIS Dilated cardiomyopathy of ischaemic aetiology with severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 25%). Idiosyncratic hepatitis secondary to taking atorvastatin. Advanced anterior infarction, with extensive anteroapical aneurysm and intraventricular thrombus. Implantation of ICD in primary prevention. CVRF: type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, ex-smoker. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

She was admitted to the gastrointestinal department for anaemia, ruling out biliary or pancreatic involvement or any other digestive pathology that might justify it.  Due to the haemolytic profile of the anaemia (elevated bilirubin at the expense of the indirect fraction, elevated reticulocytes, undetectable haptoglobin, etc.) in a patient with a prosthetic valve, she was transferred to the cardiology department to rule out possible prosthetic valve dysfunction.   PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Conscious, oriented and well hydrated. Cutaneous-mucosal jaundice. Marked increase in jugular venous pressure (estimated CVP of 16 cmH2O). Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic heart sounds at 84 bpm with systolic murmur II/VI in mitral focus. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: no alterations. Oedema with fovea up to the middle third of the lower extremities, in addition to signs of chronic venous insufficiency.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Biochemistry: creatinine 1.25 mg/dl, normal ions and transaminases, basal glucose 91 mg/dl, total cholesterol 145 mg/dl, LDH 1,308 U/l, haptoglobin absent, increased reticulocytes (7%), increased total bilirubin 2.1 mg/dl and direct bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl. Direct and indirect Coombs test negative. Vitamin B12 and folic acid normal. Mild iron deficiency (IST 15%). Haemoglobin 8 g/dl, haematocrit 24%, platelets 71,000/mm3. Transesophageal echocardiography: normofunctioning mitral prosthesis with moderate periprosthetic leak (in the posterior wall; at 5-6 hours) of 9 x 5 mm with regurgitation not reaching the atrial roof. Free atrial appendage. Normal sized left ventricle (LV) with mild concentric hypertrophy and preserved systolic function (EF 67%). Dilatation and mild dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV). PET-CT scan No 1: increased fixation of the periprosthetic radiotracer (in the form of an incomplete ring) suggestive of endocarditis on mitral prosthesis. PET-CT scan No 2: resolution of periprosthetic uptake is observed.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given a severe haemolytic anaemia in a patient with a metallic valve prosthesis without any other cause, a transesophageal echocardiogram was requested which confirmed a de novo perivalvular leak with associated moderate mitral insufficiency. Due to the appearance of a new paravalvular leak, a PET-CT scan was performed in search of an aetiology, showing perivalvular uptake suggestive of infective endocarditis. Although the patient was afebrile throughout admission and all blood cultures were negative without having received previous antibiotic treatment, he had high titres of Coxiella IgG, so antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone for 6 weeks and doxycycline for 18 months. Six weeks after starting the antibiotic regimen, a new PET-CT scan was performed, which no longer showed mitral uptake. Treatment with erythropoietin and folic acid was also started to treat the haemolytic anaemia. Despite the resolution of the infectious condition, asthenia and anaemia persisted in the context of valve dysfunction, so it was decided to intervene on the valve. Due to the high surgical risk of open surgery, increased by the patient's refusal to use blood transfusions and blood products, it was finally decided to proceed with percutaneous closure of the paravalvular leak. Postoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed and showed an acceptable result.  DIAGNOSIS Late infective endocarditis on mitral prosthesis due to Coxiella burnetii. Haemolytic anaemia due to prosthetic dysfunction. Percutaneous closure of periprosthetic leak. |O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the hospital with a general syndrome, fever and dyspnoea. After positive blood cultures for Abiotrophia defectiva (former Streptococcus viridans), antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone. Diuretic treatment was also associated with diuretic treatment to control congestive symptoms. An echocardiogram was performed, showing infective endocarditis on the tricuspid and aortic valves, with severe aortic insufficiency and dilated LV. After adding gentamicin to ceftriaxone, he remained afebrile. A gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed, with no evidence of active bleeding, and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of masses or other relevant pathology. He was presented at the medical-surgical session and was accepted for surgical treatment. He underwent surgery: placement of a mechanical aortic prosthesis, mitral annuloplasty and tricuspid annuloplasty and closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD), without complications. After a joint assessment with the infectious diseases department, antibiotic treatment was decided 6 weeks after surgery, and he was transferred to cardiology to complete treatment. Antibiotic treatment was completed and a control echocardiogram was performed with no images suggestive of vegetations, and the patient was discharged from hospital.  DIAGNOSIS Endocarditis on aortic and tricuspid valve. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, secondary to valvular heart disease. Grade IV aortic insufficiency due to valve destruction. Grade III tricuspid regurgitation due to destruction of the septal leaflet. Grade III functional mitral insufficiency. Perimembranous ventricular septal defect. Severe pulmonary hypertension at rest. Aortic valve replacement by mechanical prosthesis, mitral annuloplasty, tricuspid annuloplasty and VSD closure. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CBC 26/12/2018: haemoglobin 12.1 g/dl (12-15.6), haematocrit 39.3% (35.5-45.5), leukocytes 7.7, x10e3/μl (3.9-10.2), neutrophils 60.7% (42-77), platelets 258 x10e3/μl (150-370), INR 1.2 (0.8-1.2), fibrinogen 296 mg/dl (150-450), AST 35 IU/l (15-37), ALT 60 IU/l (13-56), GGT 35 IU/l (5-55), c-reactive protein 7.5 mg/l (0-3), glucose 102 mg/dl (74-106), urea 36 mg/dl (15-39), creatinine 1.08 mg/dl (0.55-1.02), glomerular filtration rate (CKD EPI) 66,2 ml/mn/1.73 m2 (60-999999), sodium 138.7 mmol/l (136-145), potassium 3.80 mmol/l (3.5-5.1), chlorine 107.0 mmol/l (98-107), NT-proBNP 4300. CBC at discharge: red blood cells 4.31 x10e6/μl (3.9-5.2), haemoglobin 12 g/dl (12-15.6), haematocrit 40% (35.5-45.5), leucocytes 6.3 x10e3/μl (3.9 - 10.2), neutrophils 49% (42-77), lymphocytes 40.1 % (20-44), platelets 271 x10e3/μl (150-370), creatinine 1,00 mg/dl (0.55-1.02), sodium 134.3 mmol/l (136-145), potassium 3.80 mmol/l (3.5-5.1), chlorine 97.0 mmol/l (98-107), NT-proBNP 2813 pg/ml (0-125). Chest X-ray on admission: alteration of the morphology of the cardiomediastinal silhouette with growth mainly of the left atrium (LA) and right ventricle (RV). Vascular redistribution in upper lung fields to be assessed with the patient's baseline cardiac function. Pulmonary parenchyma with non-specific alterations. Transthoracic echocardiogram: moderately dilated left ventricle (DTDVI 60 mm), somewhat spherical, and with systolic dysfunction that appears mild by this technique. The end of the apex is not adequately defined, which, although it could be explained by a certain degree of obliteration of the apex, may also be related to the ultrasound window. There is mild eccentric hypertrophy, with some linear hyperechogenicity of the septum. Pseudonormal diastolic pattern with shortened deceleration time (0.08 seconds). Slightly dilated right ventricle (RVOT 45 mm), with systolic function parameters at the limit of normality (TAPSE 17 mm, shortening fraction 34%, systolic wave 9.4 cm/s). Moderate-severe dilatation of the LA and mild-moderate dilatation of the right atrium (RA). Mitral valve with leaflets not clearly thickened or calcified, with preserved opening and moderate-severe insufficiency, reaching the roof of the atrium with coanda effect although it is more important in proto-mesosystolic. Morphologically and functionally normal aortic valve. Slightly eccentric tricuspid insufficiency, of mild-moderate degree, which allows estimating a PSAP of around 60-65 mmHg. Minimal amount of pericardial fluid. Visualised segments of the aorta and pulmonary arteries without alterations.  Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): 1. Morphological study: the LV is of normal size with high cardiac output (7l/min). It is not hypertrophic. Its function is at the low limit of normality (LVEF 51%). Eccentric mitral regurgitation (MR) towards the posterior aspect of the LA is at least moderate. After contrast administration, a laminar thrombus is observed along the entire LV apex, with a maximum thickness of 5 mm. Diffuse subendocardial perfusion defect with subendocardial late enhancement (<25%) is seen throughout the LV wall. The right ventricle is of normal size with moderate dysfunction (RVEF 38%) with global hypokinesia. There is rectification of the interventricular septum suggestive of RV pressure overload. Tricuspid insufficiency (TI), which appears moderate. No significant enhancement was observed after contrast administration. Biauricular dilatation. LA 65 x 60 x 58 mm. RA 68 x 58 mm. Intact atrial septum. Small amount of bilateral pleural and pericardial effusion. Mild hepatomegaly. Dilatation of the inferior vena cava (IVC). Cystic image in the right breast. 2. Ventricular function study (calculated on short axis) left ventricle: end-diastolic volume 144 ml (86 ml/m2). Telesystolic volume 70 ml (42 ml/m2). Systolic volume 74 ml. Cardiac output 7 l/min. Ejection fraction (EF %) 51%. Mass 103 g (62 g/m2). Right ventricle: end-diastolic volume 130 ml (78 ml/m2). End-systolic volume 81 ml (49 ml/m2). Systolic volume 49 ml. Cardiac output 4.6 l/min. Ejection fraction (EF %) 38%. 3. Flow quantification: pulmonary aortic flow. Systolic volume 39.8 ml. Anterograde volume 40.8 ml. Retrograde volume 1 ml. Regurgitant fraction 2.4%. Maximum velocity 1 m/s. Systolic volume 33.8 ml. Anterograde volume 35.6 ml. Retrograde volume 1.8 ml. Regurgitant fraction 5%. Mean velocity 7.2 cm/s. Conclusion: LV neither dilated nor hypertrophic with function at the lower limit of normality and high cardiac output. Subendocardial enhancement in all segments with laminar thrombus in the apex. RV neither dilated nor hypertrophic with moderate dysfunction. Biauricular dilatation. MR and TR at least moderate. The findings suggest restrictive cardiomyopathy with the most likely cause being endomyocardial fibrosis. Endomyocardial biopsy: study of four samples showing findings compatible with endomyocardial fibrosis with the presence of extensive fibrosis and severe endocardial thickening, as well as images compatible with thrombus. Right catheterisation: pressure study. RA pressure 12 mmHg, systolic right ventricular pressure 65 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure 64/28 (40) mmHg, pulmonary capillary pressure 20 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient 20 mmHg, cardiac output 2.6 bpm, cardiac index 1.5 bpm/m2. Pulmonary vascular resistance 7.7 UW. Abdominal ultrasound: conclusion: hepatic venous congestion. Microbiology: blood cultures (2/1): E. cloacae. Urine culture (4/1): contaminated urine. Blood cultures (18/1): sterile. Urine culture (19/1) negative. Serology: Syphilis IgG negative, toxoplasma IgG negative, rubella IgG positive, HSV IgG negative, IgM negative, varicella IgG doubtful, cytomegalovirus IgG positive, IgM negative, HAV IgM negative, IgG positive, HBs Ag negative, anti-HBs Ag negative, anti-HBs borderline positive, HAV IgG positive, HIV 1/2 negative, measles IgG positive, mumps IgG positive.  CLINICAL COURSE A 36-year-old woman was admitted for the first episode of heart failure. Depletive treatment was started with good clinical evolution. An echocardiogram was performed showing restrictive cardiomyopathy with mild left ventricular dysfunction and moderate-severe MI with severe pulmonary hypertension. Treatment for heart failure was started with good tolerance, titrating low doses of enalapril due to a tendency to hypotension. He subsequently presented signs of low cardiac output, with discrete deterioration of renal function and elevation of liver enzymes and coagulation alteration. A course of levosimendan was administered with clinical improvement. She presented a fever peak on the fifth day of admission with shivering and haemodynamic worsening, requiring admission to the coronary unit and inotropic support with intravenous noradrenaline in the context of bacteraemia due to Enterobacter cloacae, which was treated with a course of intravenous meropenem. In the following days the patient improved clinically, and the noradrenaline was withdrawn and diuretic doses were reduced. A CMR was performed which showed findings compatible with endomyocardial fibrosis and the presence of a laminar thrombus in the apex. In view of the suspicion of endomyocardial fibrosis, an endomyocardial biopsy was performed which confirmed the diagnosis. A right heart catheterisation was also performed, showing pulmonary hypertension (group 2) with increased pulmonary vascular resistance and low cardiac output. Due to the presentation in cardiogenic shock and the poor prognostic data, a pre-transplant cardiac study was initiated.    DIAGNOSIS First episode of heart failure Restrictive cardiomyopathy: endomyocardial fibrosis. Moderate-severe mitral insufficiency (MI). Moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Severe pulmonary hypertension group 2. LV apex thrombus. Cardiogenic shock and septic shock associated with Enterobacter cloacae bacteraemia. Adaptive syndrome with anxious-depressive symptoms. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 21-year-old girl, with no personal history of interest or usual treatment. Pregnancy at term with euthyphalic vaginal delivery in a private clinic 48 hours before being brought to the emergency department. The gestation was uncomplicated, as was the delivery. However, 48 hours after delivery, the patient began with pinkish expectoration and rapidly progressive dyspnoea and was referred to our hospital. On arrival at the ED, her vital signs were: Blood pressure 100/69 mmHg. Heart rate 140 bpm. Respiratory rate 24 rpm. O2 saturation 96% with FiO2 100%. On physical examination she was pale and sweaty, with distal coldness. There was no jugular ingurgitation at 45o. Cardiac auscultation was rhythmic with a gallop rhythm on the third sound. Pulmonary auscultation with bibasal crackles. Abdomen distended. Upper and lower extremities without oedema, with palpable distal pulses.    COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): on arrival, sinus tachycardia, with normal PR, narrow QRS, without repolarisation disorders. Blood tests: Baseline arterial blood gas on arrival: pH 7.44, pCO2 27.6 mmHg, pO2 55.9 mmHg, HCO3 18.6 mmol/l. Biochemistry: glucose 84 mg/dl, urea 47 mg/dl, creatinine 0.85 mg/dl, Na 140 mEq/l, K 4.3 mEq/l, chlorine 105 mEq/l, estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) > 60, troponin 0.06 > 0.09 > 0.03 ng/ml. Lactate 18.7 mg/dl, NT-proBNP 12442 pg/ml. Haemocytes: leucocytes 5.1 10e3/μl, haemoglobin 11.2 g/dl, MCV 70 fl, platelets 234 10e3/μl. Coagulation: prothrombin activity 81%, INR 1,16. Chest X-ray: perihilar interstitial pattern compatible with acute pulmonary oedema. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on admission: slightly dilated left ventricle (LVED 57 mm) with very severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 10-15%). Right ventricle of normal size and function. Tricuspid and normofunctioning aortic valve. Normal mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation (MR). Indirect evidence of increased left filling pressures. Normal tricuspid valve without insufficiency. Type I pulmonary flow. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with inspiratory collapse. No coarctation of the aorta. Calculated GCS for continuity of 3.7 l/min. Pleural effusion in both lung bases. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): dilated left ventricle (LV) with end-diastolic volume 164 ml (corrected for body surface area of 100 ml/m2). Telesystolic volume 132 ml (80 ml/m). EF 20%. Diffuse hypokinesia without clear segmental changes. No abnormal intramyocardial enhancement after contrast injection at early or late times. No evidence of significant pericardial effusion. Rest of the study without alterations. Severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 20%). In the clinical context suggests peripartum cardiomyopathy. Other tests: PCR adenovirus, enterovirus and herpes virus: negative. Serology for Toxoplasma, CMV, herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr, HSV 1 and 2, HIV and hepatitis: negative. Transthoracic echocardiogram at discharge: left ventricle slightly dilated. Severe LV systolic dysfunction. LVEF 25%. Paradoxical septal motion. Right ventricle (RV) not dilated with preserved RV systolic function. Mitral regurgitation in the mild range. Normal diastolic Doppler pattern. Normal diastolic tissue Doppler pattern. Normal pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (14 mmHg+PVC). Vena cava not dilated.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The coronary unit was notified due to suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), as the patient presented poor general condition, tachypnoea, desaturation and a tendency to hypotension. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed at the bedside showing very severe LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF 15%) with hyperdynamic RV, so, on suspicion of acute pulmonary oedema triggered by peripartum cardiomyopathy, she was urgently transferred to our unit. After being urgently admitted to the coronary unit, inotropic treatment was started with dobutamine and diuretics, both at high doses. In the following hours the evolution was adequate, with significant negative balance, improved oxygenation and organ perfusion data. This allowed for a progressive decrease in inotropic and diuretic support. Dobutamine perfusion was suspended and neurohormonal treatment with bisoprolol and enalapril was started, with good tolerance. ten days after admission, she was discharged to the cardiology ward, where the study was completed with a cardiac magnetic resonance that ruled out pathological enhancements and an inflammatory component at cardiac level with an estimated LVEF of 20%. Based on these data, and given the high risk of ventricular arrhythmias in a very young patient, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The subcutaneous route was chosen, given the possible improvement or recovery of ventricular function experienced by some patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy in the following months, as reported in the literature. A genetic study was requested and a frameshift variant was found in the TTN gene (encoding titin), which is considered pathogenic.  DIAGNOSIS Acute pulmonary oedema. Peripartum cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Subcutaneous ICD implantation as primary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias. Positive genetic study for pathogenic variant in the titin gene. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 39-year-old man presented with dyspnoea.  BACKGROUND: Family history: paternal grandmother, paternal uncles and father suffered from dilated cardiomyopathy and died of sudden death. He has two living sisters diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiovascular risk factors: active smoker of 1 pack a day, obese, dyslipidaemia type hypertriglyceridaemia. He was also a moderate drinker, with no alcohol consumption at present. Cardiological history: diagnosed in 2012 with dilated cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, non-ischaemic, with criteria of non-compaction cardiomyopathy on magnetic resonance imaging after admission to cardiology for heart failure (HF) (videos 1-2). It was reported as: dilated left ventricle (LV) (end-diastolic volume [EDV] 195 ml/m2 and end-systolic volume [ESV] 161 ml/m2). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 17% due to diffuse severe hypokinesia. Lateral and apical predominant hypertrabeculation meeting radiological criteria for non-compaction. Small area of intramyocardial late enhancement at the basal insertion of both ventricles. Dilated right ventricle (RV) (RVT 141 ml/m2 and STV 106 ml/m2). Right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) of 25% with global hypocontractility. Severely dilated left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA). Dilatation of pulmonary artery, inferior vena cava and suprahepatic veins. Normal pericardium. During this admission, a coronary angiography was also performed, which showed right dominance and coronary arteries without significant lesions. Followed in cardiology outpatient clinic since then. Stable, with adequate compliance with hygienic-dietary measures. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), beta-blocker (BB) and aldosterone inhibitors up to maximum tolerated doses, together with ivabradine. Ergospirometry was performed in June 2013 with the following result: forced vital capacity (FVC) 4.48 l (76%), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 4.22 l (83%), FEV1% 87%. Suggestive of restrictive disorder due to obesity. VO2 max 21 ml/kg/min, coincides with the threshold. VE max 106 l/min Eq CO2 at threshold 30. Maximum heart rate (HR) 149 bpm (80% maximum theoretical heart rate [MTHRF]). Exercise time 10.3 min. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation was decided for primary prevention after imaging studies showed persistent LVEF < 30%. Last check-up 6 months before admission, in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II. Other history: sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (under treatment with continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]). Usual treatment: enalapril 10 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), carvedilol 25 mg (1 tablet at breakfast and 1 tablet at dinner), spironolactone 25 mg (2 tablets at dinner), ivabradine 5 mg (1 tablet at breakfast and 1 tablet at dinner), furosemide 40 mg (1 tablet at breakfast).  CURRENT DISEASE: In NYHA functional class II until 5 weeks ago, refers progressive worsening due to increased dyspnoea until becoming minimal effort, with orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. The patient, in view of the functional worsening, increased the dose of oral furosemide from 40 mg to a dose of 160 mg per day (2 tablets at breakfast and 2 tablets at snack time). As he continued with dyspnoea on minimal exertion without improvement, he consulted the emergency department. Due to his work situation, he reported non-compliance with hygiene and dietary measures in recent weeks, with dietary transgressions. The rest of the medical history was negative.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination he is conscious and oriented, well perfused. He weighs 110 kg. Blood pressure (BP) was 120/90 mmHg. Jugular venous pressure is not measurable due to obesity. Cardiac auscultation is rhythmic at 80 beats per minute, without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation shows good ventilation in all fields. The abdomen is soft and slightly painful hepatomegaly of about 2 centimetres is palpable. The lower extremities are oedematous up to mid-leg. Distal capillary refill is good.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) (on admission): sinus rhythm at 100 bpm. PR interval of normal duration and QRS of 110 ms. Scarce R wave progression in precordials and asymmetric negative T waves in DI, aVL, V5 and V6. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: cardiomegaly and slight vascular redistribution to upper fields. No parenchymal condensation. ANALYSIS (during admission): haemoglobin 11.7 g/dl, leukocytes 10,000 /mm3 (normal formula), platelets 255.000 /mm3, glucose 87 mg/dl, creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, urea 45 mg/dl, sodium 137 mEq/dl, potassium 4.4 mEq/l, total cholesterol 112 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 75 mg/dl, uric acid 9.3 mg/dl, gamma-GT 74 U/l, total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl, ferritin 52 ng/dl, transferrin saturation index 4.3%, glycosylated haemoglobin 6.0%. Normal TSH. amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) fraction on admission 1,607 pg/dl, on discharge 858 pg/dl.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward for the first episode of decompensation after diagnosis of HF. Intravenous diuretic treatment was started with improvement of the signs of congestion and symptoms. The patient lost 4 kg of weight during admission. Hygiene and dietary measures were emphasised and the patient was included in the HF consultation, and an early visit (one week after discharge) was scheduled. On discharge, the previous neurohormonal treatment was maintained with a daily dose of 160 mg of oral furosemide. At the first review, the patient was in NYHA functional class II and in euvolemia, so the dose of furosemide had been reduced to 80 mg per day. With BP of 125/70 mmHg and given the patient's profile, with risk of readmission and progression of the disease, it was decided to suspend enalapril and after 36 hours, treatment was started with sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg every 12 hours. A new check-up was scheduled after 3 weeks. On the second visit to the clinic, the patient was found to be euvolaemic and with BP levels around 120/60 mmHg. The dose of sacubitril/valsartan was increased to 49/51 mg every 12 hours. Five days after the consultation, the patient came to the emergency department for severe dizziness. Hypotension of 90/50 mmHg was noted. When assessed by the cardiology ward, it was decided to maintain the dose of sacubitril/valsartan at 49/51 mg every 12 hours, but the dose of furosemide was reduced to 40 mg, given that he showed no signs of congestion. At the next visit, systolic BP was around 110-120 mmHg, with no signs of congestion. Prior to the last dose titration of sacubitril/valsartan, it was decided to reduce the dose of furosemide 40 mg to half a tablet at breakfast. The patient was titrated to the maximum dose of sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg without symptomatic hypotension. Iron deficiency was also corrected with the administration of iron-carboxymaltose in the day hospital. At a review after 2 months, the patient was found to be in functional class I in a situation of euvolemia. Treatment after consultation follow-up: sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), carvedilol 25 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), ivabradine 5 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), furosemide 40 mg (1/2 tablet at breakfast) spironolactone 25 mg (2 tablets at dinner) omeprazole 20 mg (1 tablet at breakfast).  DIAGNOSIS HF in a patient with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular systolic dysfunction and criteria for non-compaction cardiomyopathy. NYHA functional class I. Euvolemic state. ICD carrier in primary prevention. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 35-year-old man with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, beta-thalassaemia and spondyloarthropathy, under treatment with certolizumab (anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] drug), who came to the emergency department for congruent left lower homonymous quadrantanopsia, with no other clinical manifestations. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a right arachnoid cyst as an incidental finding. With a murmur on auscultation, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed, diagnosing a mass on the right coronary leaflet, with a friable surface, which generated a double aortic lesion: moderate stenosis and severe insufficiency. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Suspecting IE, he underwent urgent surgery with implantation of a 24 mm bidisc mechanical aortic prosthesis. There were firm pericardial adhesions. The aortic valve was trivalve, dysplastic, with severe thickening of the right coronary leaflet, yellowish-parduous in colour, with necrotic material inside. The left coronary leaflet had a similar implant in proximity to the commissure with the non-coronary leaflet. The non-coronary leaflet was thickened and appeared hypoplastic.  The postoperative course was characterised by the need for reoperation due to late cardiac tamponade, without a bleeding site. Left inferior quadrantanopsia persisted, with normal fundus and brain CT with right occipital hypodensity due to subacute established infarction in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery, without mass effect or haemorrhagic transformation. Although all microbiological cultures were negative pre-, intra- and postoperatively, empirical antibiotic therapy was maintained with vancomycin and gentamicin, which was subsequently de-escalated to ceftriaxone. The patient had not received antibiotic treatment prior to diagnosis that could have decapitated the blood cultures. Pathology showed polymorphonuclear and histiocyte aggregates surrounding an amorphous basophilic substance, without confirmation of PAS-positive material. The control TTE was unaltered, and the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up due to complications in the healing of the surgical wound.  He was admitted again at the fourth postoperative month due to complete atrioventricular block, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation. TTE and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed an oscillating mass in the left ventricular outflow tract in the most anterior aspect of the ventricular side of the prosthesis, without clear images of abscess. Presence of mild aortic regurgitation that could not be correctly defined as intra- or periprosthetic due to the acoustic shadow of the prosthesis. In the thoracic CT scan, dehiscence of the prosthesis at the level of the area between the non-coronary sinus and the right coronary sinus, with saccular dilatation of the aorta. In view of the suspicion of early prosthetic endocarditis with pseudoaneurysm, it was decided to re-intervene. Dehiscence was found in the non-coronary sinus area, with disruption of the native aortic annulus and a subannular pseudoaneurysmal cavity. After explantation of the prosthesis, the entire native annulus was affected, with devitalised tissue and sloughing, requiring complete aortic transection for a successful approach. The pseudoaneurysm was repaired with a pericardial patch, the entire circumference of the native annulus was reconstructed with the same and a new 18 mm bidisc mechanical prosthesis was implanted.   Revision for late cardiac tamponade, as in the first operation, with no bleeding point observed. He completed a new course of empirical antibiotherapy with daptomycin and cloxacillin. The case was re-evaluated jointly with Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases. Certolizumab had been withdrawn after the first operation as a possible cause of alterations in healing and immunity. All requested microbiological cultures, serology and nucleic acid detection were negative, as in the first episode. Detection of Tropheryma whipplei (T. whipplei) in the surgical specimen, saliva, faeces and duodenal biopsy was negative. Cytomegalovirus was also not detected in gastric biopsy. A prolonged platelet aggregation time was found, with no other alterations in haemostasis. Absence of autoimmunity markers. Subsequent TTE detected only moderately elevated prosthesis gradients.  Five months after the second operation, the patient attended the emergency department for progressive dyspnoea with significant congestive symptoms. TTE with very severe aortic regurgitation and reappearance of extensive periprosthetic pseudoaneurysm causing prosthesis nodding. Dilated left ventricle, but with apparently preserved systolic function. The patient underwent urgent surgery, with aortic homograft implantation in the subcoronary position and closure of the pseudoaneurysm with the same stitches. Although the intraoperative TEE showed mild aortic insufficiency, the subsequent TTE showed a probably moderate intrahomograft insufficiency, difficult to quantify as it was an eccentric jet, with no limitation in the mobility of the leaflets at its opening. Dilated left ventricle with moderate-severe depression of function. Reproduction of a cavity in the aortic root. It was decided to complete a new regimen of empirical antibiotic therapy and discharge with outpatient control to repeat complementary tests, while awaiting the results of cultures.  The TEE at one month after the last intervention showed the insufficiency with an eccentric jet in the anterior direction, at least moderate. In the aortic root there was a cavity with systolic expansion compatible with pseudoaneurysm, confirmed by thoracic CT. The polymerase chain reaction of the surgical specimen from the latter procedure was positive for T. whipplei. Given the clinical stability and complexity of the case, it was decided to start treatment for Whipple's disease with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine, and outpatient monitoring. Currently, in the sixth postoperative month, the clinical situation is stationary, asymptomatic for dyspnoea or other cardiorespiratory symptoms. A new TTE and CT scan showed no changes with respect to previous scans, and conservative management was chosen for the time being, given the complexity of the case.  IE is a serious disease, which requires rapid management based on a diagnosis of suspicion for optimal medical and surgical treatment, with decisions made by a multidisciplinary team. It may be a consequence of previous antibiotic treatment or due to fungi and bacteria of demanding culture. Microorganisms requiring serology for diagnosis, such as Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella, Aspergillus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Brucella and Legionella pneumophila, and microorganisms requiring polymerase chain reaction tests such as T. whipplei, Bartonella and fungi stand out. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Male patient, 70 years of age, white, agricultural worker, with no remarkable pathological history. He presented with fever, vomiting and dehydration, interpreted as bacterial bronchopneumonia, for which he was treated with antimicrobials. Two weeks later, he complained of general malaise, malaise and dizziness. He was re-evaluated and a second-degree atrioventricular block was detected, so the heart rate was regulated with a transient pacemaker (PM), to later implant the permanent generator. The referred symptoms worsened and dyspnoea appeared. A transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) study detected an intracardiac mass and he was referred to our centre. Physical examination revealed a diminished vesicular murmur towards the lung bases, with wheezing, and a diastolic murmur towards the tip that appeared to change with changes in the patient's position. The baseline electrocardiogram showed a rhythm of MP to 80 beats per minute, and the chest X-ray showed a small left pleural effusion with pulmonary oedema. There was anaemia and mild leukocytosis with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed the tumour mass attached to the anterior mitral leaflet on its atrial side, which prolapsed into the left ventricle (LV) in diastole, producing a peak transvalvular mitral diastolic gradient of 20 mmHg, and a mean of 10 mmHg, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60.5%. Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary lesions, and the patient was prepared for urgent surgery.  In the operating theatre, after longitudinal median sternotomy, arterial and venous cannulation for extracorporeal circulation (ECC), right atriotomy, aortic clamping and anoxic arrest with isothermal haematic cardioplegia, the interatrial septum (AIS) was opened with extension to the roof of the left atrium (LA). This exposed a yellowish-brown oval tumour mass, approximately 8 cm in diameter, with an implantation base extending into the mitral annulus involving its anterior leaflet and causing loss of mitral annulus integrity. The tumour was completely resected next to the mitral leaflet and a Sorin/Carbomedics Standard 25 mm bi-disc mechanical prosthesis was implanted. The procedure was completed in a conventional manner, without difficulties, using 87 minutes of aortic clamping and 120 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass. He was extubated 2 hours after arrival at the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, transferred to the conventional ward on the second day, and discharged on the sixth postoperative day. At three months follow-up the patient was asymptomatic, in sinus rhythm (inhibited PM) and TTE showed a left LA free of tumour masses, a normofunctioning mechanical prosthesis, with a transvalvular gradient of 12 mmHg and LVEF of 58%. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 77-year-old male patient with a clinical history of arterial hypertension, permanent atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation, and a surgical history of implantation of a definitive endocavitary VVI pacemaker several years ago.  The patient suddenly presented with language impairment, characterised by difficulty in uttering and understanding language, and behavioural changes, for which he was taken to the emergency department.  Physical examination revealed a fever of 38.1 °C. Pulmonary auscultation showed slight crackles, predominantly in the left base, with no signs of bronchospasm. Cardiac auscultation revealed protodiastolic acoustic vibration in the pulmonary focus. The neurological examination showed the patient to be conscious, not speaking and obeying simple commands.  A CT scan of the brain showed left frontal intraparenchymal haemorrhage and doubtful left fronto-parietal hypodensity. Chest X-ray showed left pleural effusion. Blood cultures showed S. bovis type I (gallolyticus).  To rule out possible endocarditis, an echocardiogram was performed, showing aortic sclerosis with double aortic lesion, nodular and mobile images that prolapse in diastole to LV outflow chambers of half a centimetre in diameter, indicative of aortic vegetation. Preserved LV systolic function. 2 cm × 1.1 cm image in hypermobile pulmonary valve prolapsing in protodiastole into the right ventricular outflow tract and generating the protodiastolic acoustic vibration described on auscultation.  The case was referred to the Cardiac Surgery Department; due to the context of his haemorrhagic stroke, we decided to wait at least 4 weeks with antibiotic treatment before performing surgery. During his hospitalisation the patient remained stable, aortic and pulmonary vegetations persisted in the control echocardiograms.  A thoraco-abdominal CT scan was performed; the chest showed a small bilateral pleural effusion and a probable repletion defect of 7.5 mm, compatible with vegetation at the level of the aortic valve. Its appearance is rounded and suggests a simple cyst or hamartoma rather than an infarct; multiple diverticula are observed in the colon, and colonoscopy is recommended. In the colonoscopy, diverticula and polyps are found; polypectomy is performed. The results of the pathological anatomy report a tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  After 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, the patient underwent surgery. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 48-year-old man with no medical history presented with dyspnoea on slight exertion and malleolar oedema of 15 days' duration. Examination showed bibasal crackles and blood tests showed 11,600 leukocytes with 78.5% segmented, 13.4% lymphocytes and 7.2% monocytes, in addition to normal biomarkers. The electrocardiogram showed previously known left bundle branch block. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral interstitial infiltrates and chest CT showed diffuse interstitial thickening over "ground glass" images ("crazy paving" pattern). Given the findings suggestive of interstitial pneumonitis, it was decided not to initiate antibiotic therapy. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed ventricular dilatation with severe systolic dysfunction, so he was transferred to cardiology. Coronary angiography showed severe lesions in the distal anterior descending, proximal circumflex and acute marginal arteries, which did not justify myocardial dysfunction. Cardiac MRI was performed one month after symptom onset and showed anterolateral hyperintensity with late subepicardial enhancement, left ventricular dilatation and LVEF of 13%, compatible with subacute myocarditis. Anti-CMV IgM and IgG antibodies and anti-CMV PCR were positive, so treatment with oral valganciclovir was started for two weeks. He progressed satisfactorily and three months later remained clinically stable, with baseline NYHA class II dyspnoea and LVEF of 45% according to control echocardiography. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of an 80-year-old patient with endocarditis on a biological prosthetic valve, of uncertain aetiology, which caused an abscess on the valve with dehiscence of the annulus. The patient had no known allergies. He had been an ex-smoker of 20 cigarettes/day for more than 20 years, and consumed 2 glasses of wine per day. Independent for basic activities of daily living. Two years ago he went to the emergency department of his reference hospital for progressive dyspnoea to the point of minimal effort. At that time, the patient had a personal history of glaucoma, hyperuricaemia, DM II and hypercholesterolaemia. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed during admission revealed a silent myocardial infarction in the inferolateral wall (akinesia with thinning of the wall), moderate mitral insufficiency, dilated left ventricle (LV) (end-diastolic volume 155 ml) and hypertrophic (interventricular septum in diastole 13 mm) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% by the Simpson biplanar method. He was discharged with a diagnosis of emphysema-type COPD with bilateral subpleural pulmonary bullae (FEV1/FVC 40.94% post-BD) and established infarction of uncertain chronology inferolaterally.  At the one-year follow-up TTE, severe eccentric mitral regurgitation was detected with a drop in ejection fraction and worsening dyspnoea: LVEF 47% by Simpson biplanar. The patient was proposed for cardiac surgery. Preoperative coronary angiography showed significant 2-vessel coronary artery disease (severe stenosis in the LAD and proximal DC), and he underwent aortocoronary bypass: left internal mammary to anterior descending, and replacement of the mitral valve with a Labcor No. 31 biological prosthesis, preserving the posterior leaflet of the native valve (non-revascularised DC, non-viable territory).  In the immediate postoperative period he presented a postcardiotomy syndrome with good response to depletive and anti-inflammatory treatment (colchicine for 6 months). The patient remained asymptomatic. In the control echocardiography 6 months after surgery, a 19 x 11 mm thrombus was detected on the atrial side of the septal leaflet of the biological prosthesis. Anticoagulation therapy was optimised. Nineteen days after admission, he presented a fever peak of up to 38.5 oC with no apparent focus. Serial cultures were taken (all negative) and empirical antibiotic treatment was prescribed for 10 days. 25 days after optimisation of anticoagulant treatment, an echocardiographic check-up was performed and it appeared that the thrombus was no longer present.  Two months later the patient presented with an episode of weakness, unilateral loss of vision and nausea. During his admission, the reappearance of the intraprosthetic thrombus was observed, and anticoagulant treatment was optimised again: inflammation parameters and serial cultures were negative. Before discharge, he presented an episode of isolated febrile fever of 37.4 oC, so serial cultures were repeated and TEE was repeated, showing a sessile and mobile endocardial wart on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, measuring 8.5 mm. In the area where the thrombus had developed, a new finding was detected: pseudoaneurysm of the mitral valve annulus measuring 20 x 6 mm (high suspicion of endocardial process). Given the suspicion of infective endocarditis in the TEE, empirical antibiotic treatment was started. Cultures were negative, as were serologies and PCR. A PET-CT study was performed which showed images suggestive of infective endocarditis on the mitral prosthetic valve. In addition, a follow-up TEE performed 1 month later showed a new-onset mitral valve annulus perforation: severe periprosthetic insufficiency. The patient required further depletive treatment.  Given the diagnosis of endocarditis with negative blood cultures, in addition to repeating the different cultures, serology for Bartonella, Brucella, Chlamydia, Coxiella, Legionella, Mycoplasma and Borrelia was performed. Serology for Bartonella henselae was positive on two occasions (IgG 1/2048, IgM 1/40). In view of these results, antibiotic treatment was adjusted. In addition, given the presence of a local complication in early prosthetic endocarditis, the patient was proposed for surgery. The patient decided not to undergo surgery. For this reason, oral doxycycline treatment was maintained indefinitely (B. henseale). A control transthoracic echocardiography performed 1 month after the start of treatment revealed a mitral perivalvular abscess with partial "disinsertion" of the mitral annulus rocking motion. Given the patient's decision, medical treatment was optimised again. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Subsequent follow-up in cardiology outpatient clinic with good functional class (NYHA: I-II) and reporting occasional palpitations. The last echocardiogram in 2016 showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a normofunctioning prosthesis although with slightly elevated gradients (maximum gradient of 47 and mean gradient of 24, estimated aortic valve area [AVA] of 1.5 cm2).  Other history: Anxiety-depression disorder to mental health follow-up since 2016. Assessed in neurology in 2015 for visual phenomena, with small lacunar infarcts and microembolism on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Bronchial asthma. Psoriasis.  Surgical interventions: Gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y) and eventroplasty as a treatment for morbid obesity in 2008. Cholecystectomy and hysterectomy in 2009.  Home medication: Acenocoumarol according to guideline, amiodarone 200 mg/24 h, enalapril 20 mg/24 h, diltiazem 60 mg/8 h, furosemide 40 mg/24 h, almotriptan 12.5 mg/24 h, escitalopram 20 mg/24 h, ketazolam 15 mg/24 h, omeprazole 20 mg/24 h, formoterol/budesonide/24 h, 5 mg folic acid/24 h, lorazepam 1 mg/24 h, salbutamol if required.  Present illness A 48-year-old woman attended the emergency department of our centre due to sudden dyspnoea in the last few hours, accompanied by dizziness, general malaise and palpitations. She reported good adherence to medical treatment, although higher than usual ethanol consumption in recent months and regular control of anticoagulation levels with significant fluctuations.  Physical examination Vital signs: blood pressure 80/40 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, saturation 90%. General condition: fair, sweating and respiratory work. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, systolic murmur in aortic focus, no auscultation of prosthetic click. Pulmonary auscultation: scattered crackles and rhonchi. Jugular ingurgitation. Absence of oedema in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: CBC: haemoglobin 14.1 g/dl, leukocytes 6.55 x10E3/μl, platelets 128 x10E3/μl. Biochemistry: Na 138 mmol/l, K 4.5 mmol/l, Cr 0.93 mg/dl, ultrasensitive troponin T 158 ng/l, NTproBNP 13000. Coagulation: INR 1.10. Arterial blood gas: pH 7.45, pO2 51 mmHg, pCO2 33 mmHg, HCO3 23.5 mmHg. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus tachycardia at 100 bpm with diffuse repolarisation alterations. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. Middle sternotomy wires and aortic ring. No data of acute pathology. Angio-CT of pulmonary arteries: no evidence of TEPA. No signs of congestion. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle with mild hypertrophy and mildly impaired systolic function. High filling pressures. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Slightly dilated left atrium. Mechanical aortic prosthesis with severe double lesion, very high gradients (maximum gradient of 100 and mean of 75 mmHg). Moderate mitral insufficiency. Moderate tricuspid insufficiency allowing estimation of a PSAP of 55. Fluoroscopy: absence of movement of one of the prosthetic discs. Transesophageal echocardiogram: image compatible with thrombus on the ventricular side of the most posterior disc and another image on the aortic side of the most anterior disc, indicating very severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency in the context of prosthetic thrombosis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the emergency department, the patient presented with significant dyspnoea associated with respiratory distress. Initially, given the clinical situation and normal chest X-ray and prior to the arrival of the analytical results, an angio-CT scan of the pulmonary arteries was performed which ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and showed no evidence of fluid overload. Urgent cardiology assessment was requested and a transthoracic echocardiogram (described above) was performed, showing a severe double aortic lesion with very high gradients. Suspicion of acute prosthetic thrombosis led to fluoroscopy, which confirmed the diagnosis. However, for a better aetiological affiliation, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed images suggestive of thrombus in both discs. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit and remained in a poor haemodynamic condition, hypotensive and tachycardic, with little response to diuretic treatment. Urgent assessment by cardiac surgery was requested, who decided to perform emergency aortic valve replacement. Intraoperative findings showed blockage of the prosthetic discs due to the presence of organised thrombus in both hinges. Finally, an ATS No 18 mechanical prosthesis was implanted, given the impossibility of implanting a biological prosthesis due to the size of the annulus, without complications. The postoperative period passed without complications, allowing early discharge to the ward. The control echocardiogram showed a normally functioning mechanical prosthesis (maximum gradient 27.5 and mean gradient 14.6 mmHg) and hospital discharge was therefore decided.  DIAGNOSIS Acute mechanical aortic prosthetic prosthesis thrombosis. Cardiogenic shock secondary to the same. Implantation of a mechanical aortic prosthesis ATS No18. LVEF preserved at discharge. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient in our clinical case is a 40-year-old woman from León, with no contact with the rural environment or animals. She has no drug allergies and her relevant history includes epidemiological contact with tuberculosis that required chemoprophylactic treatment in childhood, with no evidence of subsequent development of the disease, and a benign ovarian tumour being followed up by gynaecology.  She attended her referral hospital with a clinical picture of one week's evolution consisting of general malaise, dyspnoea and suprasternal pain with palpitations. She also reported an episode of generalised urticaria that resolved after taking antihistamines at home. Suspecting thyroid pathology, she was discharged under beta-blocker treatment, pending analytical results.   Due to persistent symptoms, she requested a second opinion at another centre, where she underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram that showed dilatation of the right chambers and pulmonary hypertension, together with cystic images in the liver. She was referred to the emergency department of her referral hospital to rule out acute pulmonary thromboembolism.  Physical examination on arrival: BP: 102/55 mm Hg. HR: 100 bpm. Ta: 36.2oC. SpO2: 93% basal. Regular general condition. Conscious, oriented in the 3 spheres and cooperative. Normal colour, normohydrated and normoperfused. Discreetly tachypnoeic at rest, with good respiratory dynamics. Head and neck: absence of jugular ingurgitation. No palpable goitres or adenopathies. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, tachycardic heart sounds. No murmurs or extratonos are heard. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur in both hemithoraxes, no extra sounds. Abdomen: hydro-aerial sounds present and of normal characteristics. Soft, depressible, not painful on superficial or deep palpation, with no signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower extremities: pedial pulses present and symmetrical. No oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests at the referral hospital: elevated NT proBNP (5981 pg/ml), D-dimers (20887 ng/ml). Other parameters in normal range. Angio-CT scan at the referral hospital: hypodense mass was observed occupying the left pulmonary artery and extending obstructing all ipsilateral lobar and segmental arteries, as well as a second mass of similar characteristics in the right interlobar artery, in addition to an area in the right lower lobe suggestive of pneumonitis or pulmonary infarction and a cavity with a mass inside it in the meniscus sign in the left lower lobe. There was also dilatation of the pulmonary artery trunk and evidence of right ventricular overload, findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver at his referral hospital: a large cystic lesion with calcified wall in the right hepatic lobe corresponding to a hydatid cyst with daughter vesicles, with rupture of the capsule with focal extension and invasion of the inferior vena cava. Transthoracic echocardiogram in our centre: mild right ventricular dysfunction, with severe pulmonary hypertension (estimated PSAP: 60-65 mmHg), showing intraluminal masses in the pulmonary artery and extrinsic compression of the vena cava. Normal left ventricular function and absence of significant valvular heart disease.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In view of these findings, serology for hydatidosis was performed, which was positive, so antiparasitic treatment was started with albendazole 400 mg/12 h and oral praziquantel 600 mg/8 h. Initial evolution was favourable, although he persisted with hypoxaemia dependent on oxygen therapy. The patient was transferred to our centre for assessment by the multidisciplinary pulmonary hypertension unit.  On arrival at our centre, the patient was haemodynamically stable. Laboratory tests showed discrete elevation of NT-proBNP (2612 pg/ml) and acute phase reactants (leukocyte count at the upper limit of normal with significant neutrophilia, C-reactive protein 24.5 mg/dl, fibrinogen 1320 mg/dl). Positive serology for hydatidosis was confirmed by ELISA test. A new transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated (images 7-9), showing mild right ventricular dysfunction, with severe pulmonary hypertension (estimated PSP 60-65 mmHg), intraluminal masses in the pulmonary artery and extrinsic compression of the vena cava, as well as normal left ventricular function and no significant valvular heart disease. After reviewing the tests performed at his referral centre, the case was presented at a multidisciplinary session involving the cardiology, radiology, infectious diseases unit, cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery and general surgery departments. At this session, a two-stage approach was decided: initially cyst extraction and scheduled hepatectomy and subsequently pulmonary endarterectomy of hydatid cysts. While awaiting this intervention, admitted to the cardiology ward, the patient presented symptoms compatible with anaphylactic shock requiring administration of intramuscular adrenaline and steroid boluses and the start of intensive fluid therapy, despite which she remained unstable both respiratory (SpO2 < 70%) and haemodynamic (BP 50/40 mmHg), so she was transferred to the coronary unit, where a central line was started and adrenaline and noradrenaline perfusion was started. She was also connected to non-invasive mechanical ventilation (EPAP 2, IPAP 9, FiO2 100%). Given the persistence of haemodynamic deterioration despite adequate support measures, a new transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing severe left ventricular dysfunction. The electrocardiogram showed no evidence of ischaemia and no significant elevation of myocardial damage markers (troponin T hs 84 ng/l, CK 152 U/l). With the suspicion of stress cardiomyopathy in relation to the episode of anaphylactic shock requiring high doses of catecholamines (which at this time included the administration of dobutamine), the possibility of implantation of veno-arterial ECMO was assessed. However, the implantation of the device was rejected for various reasons: the presence of left ventricular dysfunction that made the risk of the surgical intervention that the patient needed to cure her unacceptable at that time; the risk of new dissemination or rupture of cysts with the manipulation of lines and cannulas in the venous territory, and the complexity of the management of assistance in a patient with severe pulmonary circulation alteration. In this context, expectant management was decided, awaiting spontaneous recovery to reactivate the initial plan. During the hours immediately after the episode, the patient showed discrete haemodynamic improvement that allowed suspension of adrenaline perfusion and a decrease in noradrenaline to 0.2 μg/kg/min with progressive improvement of the distal hypoperfusion data. Under low doses of dobutamine, a new echocardiogram was performed where severe left ventricular dysfunction persisted. Respiratory stability was such that ventilatory support could be reduced with acceptable clinical tolerance. However, 24 hours after the anaphylactic shock episode, she presented a sudden episode of desaturation, with associated hypotension and spontaneous recovery after starting support with high-flow glasses with FiO2 of 1, with data compatible with pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray. Hours later, he presented with frank haemodynamic deterioration, with associated episodes of desaturation and urticaria suggesting a new case of anaphylaxis, probably due to the release of hydatid vesicles. Initially, doses of vasoactive drugs were increased, intramuscular adrenaline and bolus corticotherapy were started, despite which she presented with new haemodynamic deterioration, with moderate-severe dilatation of the right ventricle on urgent echocardiography, maintaining severe left ventricular dysfunction. The patient presented with a new episode of desaturation, associated urticaria and loss of consciousness that required orotracheal intubation, after which electromechanical dissociation was observed, which could not be reversed after 25 minutes of advanced CPR manoeuvres. When these manoeuvres were stopped, asystole and thrombosis of both ventricles were observed on transthoracic echocardiography. Relatives were informed and the possibility of performing an autopsy was explained, which they rejected.  DIAGNOSIS Severe pulmonary hypertension secondary to compromise of the pulmonary arterial tree by hydatid vesicles, probably secondary to migration from a giant hepatic hydatid cyst. Right ventricular dysfunction in the context of the above. Anaphylactic shock in relation to disseminated hepatic hydatid disease, with stress cardiomyopathy with development of secondary severe left ventricular dysfunction. Cardiorespiratory arrest in electromechanical dissociation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 65-year-old woman. Allergy to methimazole. No known cardiovascular risk factors. No history of known heart disease. Primary hyperthyroidism due to Graves-Basedow disease, treated with radioactive iodine (I-131). Current situation of hypothyroidism under replacement therapy. Left breast nodule with histology compatible with solid pattern carcinoma with multifocal neuroendocrine differentiation (somatostatin and chromogranin receptors positive), undergoing conservative surgery in 2011 and sentinel node biopsy, which was negative. Subsequent follow-up by oncology, with stability of the disease until 2014, when in the context of diarrhoeal syndrome, the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome due to metastatic liver disease with positive gammagraphic uptake for somatostatin analogues was established. Stability by imaging studies since the start of treatment with somatostatin analogues, although an increase in analytical biomarkers that led to changes in the usual treatment.  Usual treatment: levothyroxine sodium 75 mcg orally every 24 hours, lanreotide autogel 120 mg injectable every 21 days.  Present illness He came to the emergency department for marked swelling of the lower limbs and weight gain (5 kg) in the last month, although without greater dyspnoea than usual (on exertion).  She also reported an increase in the frequency of diarrhoeal episodes in the last 6 months, since the last oncology check-up. She denies other symptoms.  Physical examination Conscious and oriented in time, space and person. Facial flushing. Blood pressure 125/68 mmHg. Eupneic at rest, with saturation by pulse oximetry 99% without contributions. Pulmonary auscultation: physiological vesicular murmur. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones at 78 bpm, with pansystolic murmur (intensity III/VI) predominantly in the left parasternal border, which increases with inspiration. Abdominal examination: not painful on palpation, with discrete hepatomegaly, without signs of ascites. Examination of the extremities: oedema with fovea up to the middle third of the lower limbs, with preserved and symmetrical distal pulses. No acute inflammatory data.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 72 bpm. QRS axis 60o. PR interval 160 msec. QRS of normal voltage and amplitude. Minimal non-significant ST-segment underleveling in inferior leads. Corrected QT interval (Bazett) 460 msec. Chest X-ray: slightly increased cardiothoracic index. No costophrenic sinus impingement. No infiltrates or condensation. No images suggestive of masses. Laboratory tests (in the emergency department): mild hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dl) and hyponatraemia (Na+ 133 mmol/l). Blood count, coagulation, renal function parameters and the rest of the ionogram in normal ranges. Laboratory tests on the hospital ward: normal thyroid hormone profile. Normal iron profile. 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid 355 μmol/orine 24 h (normal values: 10-40 μmol/orine 24 h). Chromogranin A (serum) 1697 ng/ml (normal values: up to 100 ng/ml). NT-proBNP 767 ng/ml. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) neither dilated nor hypertrophic, with preserved global systolic function (LVEF 60%), without alterations in segmental contractility. Transmitral filling pattern with impaired relaxation (E: A 0.7). Slightly dilated left atrium (32 ml/m2). Mitral valve morphologically normal, with no organ involvement of interest or significant functional alterations. Tricuspid aortic valve, without organic involvement of interest, with jet of aortic regurgitation of central origin and direction that conditions mild aortic insufficiency. Aortic root of normal dimensions (26 mm). Proximal ascending aorta and aortic arch of normal size (28 mm and 26 mm, respectively). Right ventricle slightly dilated at mid-basal level (dimensions: basal diameter 43 mm, mid diameter 37 mm, length 68 mm, proximal outflow tract diameter 33 mm, distal outflow tract diameter 24 mm), with decreased longitudinal function parameters (TAPSE 15 mm, S" wave 9 cm/sec). Slightly dilated right atrium (area 20 cm2). Tricuspid valve with fibrosis at the leaflet level and restricted movement of the leaflets causing a central coaptation deficit and a tricuspid regurgitation jet leading to severe tricuspid regurgitation, with a maximum gradient (possible underestimation due to severity of regurgitation) of 50 mmHg. Pulmonary valve adequately visualised, with normal appearance. No evidence of shuntintracardiac. Inferior vena cava with dimensions in the upper normal range (20 mm) and inspiratory collapse greater than 50%. Trivial pericardial effusion.  Whole body gammagraphic study of somatostatin receptors: in comparison with the previous study (18 months earlier), multiple bilobular liver lesions were observed. The largest lesion (segment VII) shows an increase in volume (136 x 94 x 136 mm in anteroposterior-transverse-craniocaudal diameters, compared to 110 x 70 x 115 mm in the previous study). There were no other new lesions compared to the previous study. Conclusion: scintigraphic study compatible with progression of the disease.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted for a complete study, confirming the progression of the disease by means of a somatostatin receptor scintigraphy study. Given the clinical suspicion of cardiac involvement due to carcinoid syndrome (clinical symptoms and new onset murmur), a transthoracic echocardiographic study was requested, which revealed severe tricuspid insufficiency, confirming the diagnosis of carcinoid heart disease. After initiation of depletive treatment with diuretics and intensification of treatment with somatostatin analogues, the patient progressed favourably, with symptomatic improvement (reduction of oedema in the lower limbs, reduction in the number of bowel movements, no episodes of hot flushes). The case was discussed in a clinical session with the participation of medical oncology and cardiology, estimating a vital prognosis of less than 12 months, and it was decided to discharge the patient from hospital with an increase in the dose of somatostatin analogues. Despite this, the patient had a torpid subsequent evolution, with several readmissions in the following months for episodes similar to the one described, finally leading to her death.  DIAGNOSIS Stage IV mammary neuroendocrine neoplasia. Carcinoid syndrome with cardiac involvement (severe tricuspid insufficiency). Cardiac insufficiency of right predominance. Exitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): untreated dyslipidaemia, overweight grade 2. Cardiological history: 11 years ago an echocardiogram was performed which showed no abnormalities during an admission for pneumonia.  Other history: Chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 liver disease, non-responsive to interferon and ribavirin therapy. Treatment was started with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir with prior withdrawal of omeprazole from her usual treatment to avoid interaction. She finished treatment 2 months ago, totally asymptomatic, with sustained viral response. Systemic sarcoidosis secondary to treatment with interferon, which was treated with corticosteroids and interruption of interferon therapy, with no current activity. Usual treatment: omeprazole 20 mg 1 tablet per day.  Current disease A 74-year-old female patient was being followed up by hepatology outpatients for chronic HCV infection. During a follow-up visit to the hepatology outpatient clinic (2 months after finishing treatment with anti-HCV), the patient reported deterioration of functional class to dyspnoea on moderate exertion, with two-pillow orthopnoea, peripheral oedematisation and subjective decrease in daily diuresis volume, for which reason she was referred to cardiology. She reported no chest pain at rest or on exertion, no presyncopal episodes and no infectious symptoms due to equipment. At the cardiology outpatient clinic, anamnesis was performed, in accordance with the above, and NT- proBNP and transthoracic echocardiogram was requested, which showed dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment was started with sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg every 12 hours, bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg 1 tablet every 12 hours and atorvastatin/ezetimibe 80/10 mg daily. Due to evidence of iron deficiency anaemia in decompensated heart failure (HF), treatment was started with IV iron carboxymaltose in 15 minutes each dose (1,500 mg in total; 1,000 mg in the first week and 500 mg in the following week). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is requested and a new appointment is made in one month.  Physical examination Conscious and oriented in the three spheres, normohydrated, cutaneous-mucosal pallor, good general condition. Blood pressure 107/65 mmHg, heart rate 75 bpm, O2 saturation 98% room air, temperature 36.3 oC. Cardiac auscultation: regular, third sound, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur (VCM), humid bibasal crackles. Extremities: tibiomalleolar oedema with fovea, no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS AP chest X-ray: signs of venous congestion, with perihilar interstitial infiltrate, no pinching of costophrenic sinuses, cardiothoracic index (CTI) not assessable by projection. Electrocardiogram (ECG): RS at 75 bpm, PR 160 ms, QRS 100 ms, Axis 0o, LVH criteria (Sokolov-Lyon), flattened T-waves in V5-V6, aVL  Blood tests: CBC: red blood cells 4.52 10*12/l.

LDL cholesterol 229 mg/dl. Total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol 4.4. Hormones: thyrotropin (TSH) 1.77 uIU/ml. Calciuria 24 hours: within normal limits.  Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): severely dilated left ventricle (LV) with severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 30%) due to global hypokinesia. Normal sized atria. Mild central functional mitral regurgitation. Aortic valve without findings of interest. Right ventricle (RV) slightly dilated at baseline with preserved contractility. Trivial TR with PAPs 25 mmHg. Inferior vena cava not dilated.  Cardiac MRI (videos 2, 3, 4 and 5): LV volumes at the upper limit of normal (IVTDVI = 93 l/m; IVTSVI = 52 ml/m) with eccentric hypertrophy (IMVI = 84 g/m) and moderately depressed systolic function (LVEF = 44%). Generalised mild hypokinesia. Absence of myocardial oedema. Normal RV volumes (IVTDVD = 69 ml/m2; IVTSVD = 26 ml/m2) with normal systolic function (RVEF = 62%). Atria and great vessels of normal size. Lung resistance within normal values (2.6 U. Wood). First-pass perfusion at rest with e.v. gadolinium. - meglumine gadoterate 0.15 mmol/kg - no complications. Absence of significant perfusion defects. Focal late gadolinium enhancement in the medial inferior septum at the intersection with the right ventricle. Although small necrosis cannot be ruled out as it also affects the subendocardium, it could also be a focal sarcoid lesion. In summary: findings of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) of uncertain origin, probably not ischaemic although it presents a focal lesion compatible with necrosis vs. sarcoid lesion.  Catheterisation: right dominance. Coronary tree without angiographically significant lesions.  High-resolution pulmonary CT scan: mediastinal structures centred with small right paratracheal lymph node not exceeding one centimetre in maximum diameter, without appreciable lymph node growths in the hilar or axillary hollows. No pleural or pericardial effusions. No pulmonary nodules, masses or intraparenchymal infiltrates. Free main tracheobronchial tree. Cardiac MRI (control in 6 months): LV of normal volumes (VTD 70 ml/m, VTS 34 ml/m, IMVI 74 g/m2) without significant hypertrophy of its walls or alterations of segmental contractility at rest and with slightly depressed global systolic function (LVEF 51%). Abnormal septal motion. Non-dilated RV (RVOT 66 ml/m, STV 25 ml/m) with preserved global systolic function (LVEF 62%). Aorta and great vessels of normal diameter and morphology. Atria of normal dimensions. Normal pulmonary vascular resistance (mean pulmonary velocity 14.3 cm/sec). Compared with the August 2017 examination, the LV volumes improved, as did LVEF.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Continuing with the study of the left ventricular dysfunction detected at the outpatient level, cardiac MRI was performed 3 weeks after the consultation, showing improvement in ventricular function, with moderate dysfunction, and catheterisation was performed (due to the late gadolinium enhancement image suggestive of necrosis), which showed no significant angiographic lesions. The patient did not report catarrhal or other symptoms prior to the current process suggestive of myocarditis prodrome. Only the introduction and completion of HCV antivirals coincided in time. Given the findings of late gadolinium enhancement that could be partially explained by sarcoidosis in a patient with a history of iatrogenic sarcoidosis secondary to the use of interferon, a high-resolution CT scan of the lungs was performed, which showed no data suggestive of pulmonary or adenopathic sarcoidosis, nor analytical data of activity (ACE, calciuria or elevation of acute phase reactants). A literature search was conducted on cardiotoxicity due to direct antivirals against HCV. Although there is no reference to toxic myocarditis in the data sheet, articles were found referring to toxicity from drugs that act on the same targets and were withdrawn from clinical trials, reversible global longitudinal destrain worsening after sofosbuvir and exclusion of patients with heart disease and without adequate controls (with echocardiography) of cardiovascular safety in pivotal trials of antiviral drugs against HCV. Because of this, left ventricular dysfunction is attributed to the use of HCV antivirals. After starting treatment, the patient was asymptomatic, with no dyspnoea for activities of daily living. A follow-up cardiac MRI was requested after 6 months, showing normalisation of left ventricular volumes without hypertrophy and improvement in left ventricular function, with mild dysfunction remaining. Subsequently, in echocardiographic controls up to the present, LVEF has normalised and diameters are at the upper limit of normality. The study of iron deficiency anaemia showed three polyps in the right colon at colonoscopy, which were removed without significant histopathological findings. In summary, this is a case of severe left ventricular dysfunction secondary to reversible dilated cardiomyopathy. Although the findings could be explained by a past asymptomatic myocarditis, we consider more likely the possibility of toxic myocarditis related to direct antivirals against HCV, a pathology little studied in our environment, and with drugs widely used in our health system.  DIAGNOSIS Non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction, recovered. Suspected toxic myocarditis due to HCV antivirals. Iron deficiency anaemia secondary to colonic polyps. Dyslipidaemia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known drug allergies. No known classical cardiovascular risk factors. Obesity type 1. Toxic habits: ex-smoker since youth, until the debut of ischaemic heart disease, with an accumulated consumption of 30 packets/year. Non-drinker and non-consumer of other toxic substances. Chronic ischaemic heart disease with debut in 2011 with acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI) anteroseptal Killip III undergoing emergent angioplasty on proximal anterior descending artery (ADA) with a drug-eluting stent and observing chronic occlusion of distal circumflex artery (ACx). Currently in dilated phase with very severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 25-28% in 2012, 2013 and 2015, 20% in 2017 and 18% in the last control in 2019) in follow-up by the advanced heart failure and heart transplant unit. Carrier of a Medtronic Protecta single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in primary prevention since 2012. Peripheral artery disease with 70% stenosis in the left common iliac artery due to calcified plaque, asymptomatic. Left kidney with abundant cysts (some of them calcified) in which no renal parenchyma can be seen, which appears non-functioning. Current treatment: acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24 hours, carvedilol 6.25 mg/12 hours, atorvastatin 80 mg/24 hours, ezetimibe 10 mg/24 hours, sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg/12 hours, eplerenone 25 mg/24 hours, omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours.  Present illness 53-year-old male with the previously described history, including ischaemic heart disease in dilated phase with two-vessel disease (proximal LAD revascularised in 2011 and chronic occluded ACx at distal level) with very severe residual left ventricular dysfunction who was referred to the advanced heart failure and heart transplant unit for evaluation in 2017 as he was in NYHA functional class III. At that time, a complete pre-transplant study was performed without finding any contraindication for transplantation, although given that after adjustment and optimisation of medical treatment the patient remained in good functional condition, it was decided not to include him on the transplant waiting list. He has been clinically monitored by this unit on an outpatient basis since then, with medication readjustments as required. In the 2017 analytical control, he presented absolute iron deficiency, which was treated with a cycle of intravenous iron carboxymaltose in a single dose of 1000 mg. At that visit, the patient maintained his usual physical activity, although with certain limitations to moderate efforts, which improved after the replenishment of iron deposits.  Physical examination Good general condition. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Well hydrated and perfused. Height 174 cm. Weight 100 kg. Body mass index (BMI) 33. Blood pressure (BP) in range, in consultation 110/70 mmHg, and heart rate 60 bpm. Eupneic at rest and when speaking, with no semiology of heart failure. On auscultation, rhythmic heart tones with mitral systolic murmur I-II/VI without third sound or gallop rhythm. Bladder murmur was preserved without crackles or other added sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) in consultations: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. Axis normopositioned at 0o. PR 200 msec. Wide QRS of 160 msec very variegated with morphology of complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) and secondary repolarisation disorders. CBC (November 2019): blood glucose 106 mg/dl. Creatinine 1.07 mg/dl, urea 26 mg/dl, sodium 144 mEq/l, potassium 5.3 mEq/l. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 119 mg/dl, HDL-C 46 mg/dl, LDL-C 60 mg/dl, triglycerides 66 mg/dl. Normal liver and thyroid profiles. Glycated haemoglobin 5.9%. Glomerular filtration rate 77 ml/min (MDRD). NT-proBNP 198 pg/ml. Haemogram without leukocytosis with normal formula. Hb 142 g/l. Platelets 262,000. Normal coagulation study. Iron metabolism: ferritin 45 μg/l and saturation index of 20%. Analysis control after treatment with intravenous carboxymaltose: ferritin 141 μg/l and saturation index of 23%. Other parameters were similar to those of the previous control. Chest X-ray: cardio-thoracic index at the upper limit of normality with left hilum slightly blurred and vascular redistribution to the vertex, without evidence of pulmonary congestion. Single-chamber ICD with normal-positioned electrode in the right ventricular apex. Transthoracic echocardiography (November 2019): slightly dilated left atrium (46 mm AP. LVOT 37 ml/m2). Mitral valve without organic involvement, preserved opening with symmetric tenting closure and central jet of mild insufficiency. Trivalve aortic valve, without organicity and with normal flows. Aortic root not dilated: SV of 33 mm. Severely dilated left ventricle: DTD 75 mm, DTS 68 ml, VTD 387 ml, VTS 258 ml. LVEF 20% with global hypokinesia more marked in mid and apical segments. Mitral E 85 cm/sec, A 36 cm/sec, E/A= 2.85, TDE 130 msec. Septal E' 4.8 cm/sec, lateral E' 9.6 cm/sec, average E/e' 11.8. Right cavities not dilated. ICD electrode. TAPSE 21 mm. Light IP. PAP m 20 mm Hg. Normal IVC. Absence of effusion. Conclusions: dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and mild functional mitral regurgitation (MR). Ergospirometry (November 2018): the test was performed according to the modified Bruce ramp protocol without complications. Exercise time 12:24 min, stopped due to fatigue. It reached 129 bpm, 77% of the FCMT. The RER at peak effort was 1.05 which confirms that this is a conclusive test. The test shows a slightly decreased functional capacity with respect to predicted (Weber Stage B, peak oxygen consumption 19.6 ml/kg/min, 76% with respect to theoretical), ventilatory class II (VE/VCO2 slope 30.6) having reached ventilatory threshold 2. Baseline CO2 PET 36 increasing to 40 mmHg. No EOV. No alteration of the ventilatory reserve, not suggesting concomitant ventilatory alteration. From the ECG point of view, there were no dynamic changes. Isolated EV in the recovery phase. Normal blood pressure behaviour (baseline 124/80 mmHg and at maximum effort 150/90 mmHg). Conclusions: slight decrease in functional capacity with no data of poor prognosis in ergospirometry.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Since the administration of intravenous iron carboxymaltose (in 2017), the patient has remained asymptomatic and without the need for medication readjustments, with only one admission for decompensation of heart failure in a period of 2 years. On an outpatient basis, being in a stable phase of heart failure, regular monitoring of iron metabolism has been carried out, as well as the state of the iron deposits, which at all times has maintained stable figures. In the last analytical control (November 2019), as we can see in PPCC, she again presented data of iron deficit with depleted deposits, without associated anaemia, and it was decided to prescribe a new cycle of intravenous iron carboxymaltose with a dose adjusted according to the patient's weight, and in the last outpatient review by the advanced heart failure and heart transplant unit of our centre she reported an improvement in her current functional situation (currently NYHA II).  DIAGNOSIS Advanced chronic heart failure. Severe LV systolic dysfunction in a patient with chronic ischaemic heart disease in NYHA functional class II. Carrier of single-chamber ICD in primary prevention with no events during follow-up. Iron deficiency treated with intravenous iron carboxymaltose. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History We present a 68-year-old man, with no known drug allergies, a former smoker for three months and with alcohol consumption only at weekends. His personal history includes arterial hypertension on treatment with torasemide 5 mg/24 hours, dyslipidaemia on treatment with simvastatin 20 mg/24 hours and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease GOLD 1A (last spirometry performed in 2017: TI 75%, FVC 104%, FEV1 83%) under follow-up by his primary care physician. She has no history of known heart disease.  In 2018 he underwent a right inguinal hernioplasty and in July 2019 he underwent a retropubic prostatic adenomectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia with repeated acute urinary retention, having subsequently presented with episodes of haematuria.  Present illness The patient was initially referred to the emergency department from his primary care physician for progressive exertional dyspnoea of one month's duration that began after prostate surgery. The dyspnoea was accompanied by two-pillow orthopnoea, occasional episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and bilateral oedema with fovea in the lower extremities. His regular physician had increased the dose of torasemide to double (10 mg/24 hours), after which he presented with a weight loss of 3 kg. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was haemodynamically stable, tachycardic at 110 bpm and had a baseline saturation of 95%. Given the presence of congestive signs (hypoventilation in the right base with bilateral crackles, discrete hepatomegaly and oedema with bilateral fovea up to the thighs) and an elevation of NT-proBNP up to 4623 pg/ml (normal range 0-300 pg/ml), he was admitted to the cardiology department to study the first episode of heart failure.  Physical examination On admission to the cardiology department, the patient was haemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 114/75 mmHg, tachycardic at 110 bpm and oxygen saturation around 96% baseline. There was no jugular plethora. On cardiac auscultation he was rhythmic, with no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation (posterior plane) showed decreased vesicular murmur in the right base with bilateral crackles. He had a hepatomegaly of 3-4 cm, and on the extremities there was bilateral oedema with pitting up to the thighs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, normal PR, QRS axis at 0o, narrow QRS, with known flattened T waves and frequent supraventricular extrasystoles.  Laboratory tests on admission: Venous blood gas: pH 7.51, pCO2 32 mmHg, bicarbonate 26 mEq/ml. Biochemistry: glucose 112 mg/dl; urea 56 mg/dl; creatinine 1.00 mg/dl; GPT 25 U/l; bilirubin 1.4 mg/dl; calcium 8.9 mg/dl; sodium 145 mEq/l; potassium 3.6 mEq/l; chloride 108 mEq/l; CRP 2.28 mg/l; creatine kinase 71 U/l; lactate dehydrogenase 188 U/l; NT-proBNP 4623 pg/ml. Haemoglobin 10.8 g/dl; haematocrit 34.4%; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 96.1 fl; mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration 31.4 g/dl; mean erythrocyte corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) 30.2 pg; erythrocyte distribution amplitude (EDA) 14.5%; platelets 209 *10^3/ƒÊL; leucocytes 6.61 *10^3/ƒÊL. Coagulation: INR 1.3.  Other laboratory tests of interest: Lipid profile: total cholesterol 142 mg/dl, triglycerides 85 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol (calculated) 89 mg/dl, non-HDL cholesterol 106 mg/dl, urate 6.2 mg/dl. Iron profile: iron 38 ug/ml, transferrin 345 mg/dl, transferrin saturation index (TSI) 8%, ferritin 50 ng/ml. Vitamin B12 406 pg/ml, folate 4.6 ng/ml. Glycosylated haemoglobin 5.8%. Thyrotropin (TSH) 2.61 mU/l. Serology: HCV negative, HIV negative, CMV negative, parvovirus B19 Ig-G positive (Ig-M negative), enterovirus negative, adenovirus pending. Chest X-ray on admission: cardiothoracic index at the limit, with pinching of both costophrenic sinuses without other condensations. Chest X-ray prior to discharge: minimal impingement of the right costophrenic sinus with significant improvement compared to the previous one. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) (videos 1, 2, 3): severely dilated left ventricle, with severely reduced systolic function (LVEF estimated by Simpson biplane 15-21%) due to severe global hypokinesia. Doppler transmitral flow pattern suggested restrictive physiology. Mildly dilated right ventricle with mildly depressed function. Moderately dilated left atrium and mildly to moderately dilated right atrium. Mitral valve leaflets thickened, with moderate mitral insufficiency. The tricuspid valve had moderate-severe insufficiency, with a maximum RV-AD gradient of 60.7 mmHg, and an estimated PSAP of 75 mmHg. Inferior vena cava was dilated and inspiratory collapse was less than 50%. The aortic valve was trivalve, with sclerodegenerative leaflets with only mild-moderate aortic insufficiency, without aortic root dilatation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed during outpatient follow-up: severely dilated left ventricle with severely depressed global function with diffuse hypokinesia (LVEF 29%). Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction (LVEF 44%). Late enhancement sequence shows linear intramyocardial enhancement in the basal septum and septal insertion points, non-ischaemic. In addition, a mild bilateral pleural effusion was observed as an extracardiac finding. Catheterisation via the right radial artery: Left coronary angiography: common trunk without lesions. The anterior descending artery shows diffuse calcified atheromatosis with mild stenosis without any significant stenosis. The circumflex artery of medium extension and ectatic calibre at the proximal level also shows diffuse calcified atheromatosis with moderate stenosis at the marginal proximal level. Right coronary angiography: the right coronary artery is the dominant vessel, very atheromatous and with an ectatic and irregular calibre all the way to the lumen. There is a severe ulcerated lesion at the proximal level (70%). At the end of the middle segment there is a calcified focal stenosis with severe stenosis (85%). The posterior descending branch is of medium extension and with severe focal stenosis proximally. Pressure guidewire in the circumflex: the moderate circumflex lesion is explored with pressure guidewire without adenosine (RFR, parameter at rest) and is found not to cause ischaemia (RFR 0.96-0.98) and is therefore not treated. Coronary intervention: the stenosis described in the middle segment of the DC is predilated with a 4.0 mm balloon with subsequent implantation of a pharmacoactive usntent with post-dilatation with a 4.5 mm balloon at 20 atm with good results. Subsequently, after predilatation with a 4.0 mm balloon, another drug-eluting stent was implanted over the ulcerated lesion described in the proximal segment. A severe residual stenosis is evident at its proximal edge, which makes it necessary to implant another stent at this level, covering the vessel ostium. These last two stents were post-dilated with a 4.5 NC balloon at high pressure with a good final result (slight under-expansion at the ostial level of around 20%).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was a 68-year-old man admitted for a first episode of heart failure following planned prostate surgery. During admission, diuretic treatment was started, initially intravenously, and was later changed to oral therapy due to the excellent response to it, with rapid resolution of the congestive signs. In addition, after the acute phase, neurohormonal treatment was started progressively with good tolerance (nebivolol 5 mg half tablet every 12 hours as he was a bronchopathic patient, spironolactone 25 mg and finally sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg every 12 hours), with no alterations in renal function or symptomatic hypotension. An echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction due to severe global hypokinesia, and the aetiological study of this entity was initiated. A directed anamnesis was performed, in which a significant history of enolism and exposure to toxins, previous chest pain or angina pectoris, and data suspicious of myocarditis were ruled out. Due to the characteristics of our centre and the availability of performing a catheterisation more quickly than a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac catheterisation was performed first, which revealed severe stenosis of the right coronary artery in which three drug-eluting stents were implanted. A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was still to be performed at the time of discharge. On the other hand, blood tests showed normochromic normocytic anaemia with a normal range of red blood cell distribution, but with low iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation index. The digestive tract was ruled out as the origin of the anaemia, as there were no clinical signs to suggest this and the faecal occult blood test performed during admission was negative. In addition, vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency were ruled out as possible alternative causes (although the characteristics of the anaemia did not suggest this aetiology). The anaemia was interpreted in the context of the previous episodes of haematuria and the recent surgery, and it was decided to start treatment with intravenous iron in the form of iron carboxymaltose at an initial dose of 1000 mg, without complications during the infusion. At discharge, the patient was euvolaemic, with no congestive signs, and the heart failure unit of our hospital was contacted, who decided to include the patient in the remote telemonitoring programme for close patient follow-up. During subsequent follow-up in the heart failure unit, the patient reported being stable since discharge, with NYHA II-III/IV dyspnoea, stable weight, minimal oedema in the ankles and good tolerance to neurohormonal treatment. Approximately two months after discharge, the patient again began to show signs of congestion (he reported an increase in his baseline dyspnoea and oedema with fovea in the lower limbs) which led to an increase in oral diuretic treatment, with a good clinical response. In addition, a control blood test showed anaemia (haemoglobin 12.6 g/dl) with a ferritin level of 49 ng/ml and a transferrin saturation index of 11.1%, without the patient reporting bleeding at any level, so it was decided to start a new course of intravenous iron carboxymaltose with the aim of improving the patient's exercise capacity and quality of life. After the administration of an initial dose of 1000 mg in the day hospital of our centre, with no incidents during the same, a new evaluation of the patient is pending to assess the need to complete the regimen with intravenous iron.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure, first episode. Dilated cardiomyopathy, non-ischaemic, with severely depressed LVEF (LVEF estimated by Simpson biplane 15-20%). Moderate functional mitral regurgitation. Moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension. Severe single-vessel coronary artery disease (right coronary) treated with implantation of three drug-eluting stents, and moderate single-vessel coronary artery disease (obtuse marginal). Normocytic normochromic anaemia with iron deficiency. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Background Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): arterial hypertension (HT) with target organ damage, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with macro and microvascular involvement, LBP, active smoker (estimated IPA: 135).

Present illness The patient is a 60-year-old man with the aforementioned history, including multiple CVRF and established vascular disease, with chronic ischaemic heart disease, surgically revascularised and with mild residual LV systolic dysfunction, who is admitted to the neurology department for ischaemic stroke of atherothrombotic aetiology in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA), with mechanical thrombectomy and destent implantation at the level of the left carotid artery. During admission, the patient presented an episode of decompensation of heart failure and was transferred to the cardiology department for monitoring, study and intensive diuretic treatment.  Physical examination On assessment by cardiology: General condition is fair. Conscious, oriented in all 3 spheres and cooperative. Normal colour, normohydrated and normoperfused. Afebrile to the touch. Tachypneic at rest, with intolerance to decubitus. Blood pressure (BP): 160/70 mm Hg. Heart rate (HR): 73 bpm. SpO2: 91% with low-flow oxygen therapy (nasal cannulas). Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds. No murmurs, extratonos or pericardial friction rub. Pulmonary auscultation: generalised hypoventilation in both lung fields. Lower extremities: pedial pulses present and symmetrical. Edema with bilateral fovea up to the knees.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: sinus rhythm, PR 160 ms, narrow QRS, without repolarisation alterations suggestive of acute ischaemia. Chest X-ray: AP projection. Bilateral pleural effusion (minimal left, more evident on the right). Congestive hilarity and vascular redistribution.  Laboratory tests on admission: Biochemistry: glucose 186 mg/dl, creatinine 0.98 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/l, total protein 7.5 g/dl, potassium 4.59 mEq/l, albumin 4.0 g/dl, chlorine 102 mEq/l, ALT (GPT) 21 U/l, AST (GOT) 25 U/l, gamma-GT 34 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 125 U/l, LDH 384 U/l, bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl, C-reactive protein 3.02 mg/dl. Haemogram: red cells 4.56 xmill/μl, haemoglobin 14.9 g/dl, haematocrit 45.6%, MCH 32.8 pg, MCV 100.2 fl, MCHC 32.7 g/dl, RDW 14.5%, platelets 277 x1000/μl, MPV 8.8 fl, leucocytes 8.4 x1000/μl, neutrophils 6.8 x1000/μl, neutrophils % 81.2%, lymphocytes 0.8 x1000/μl, lymphocytes % 9.9%, monocytes 0.7 x1000/μl, monocytes % 7.9%, eosinophils 0.0 x1000/μl, eosinophils % 0.5%, basophils 0.0 x1000/μl, basophils % 0.5%. Coagulation: prothrombin time 16.3 sec, prothrombin activity 61%, INR (lab) 1.41, TTPa 36 sec, fibrinogen (derivative) 597 mg/dl. NT-proBNP: 10053 pg/ml. Blood tests with cardiovascular risk factors: Hb glycated (DCCT) 7.2 (%Hbtotal) %, TSH 4.49 μlU/ml, free T4 1.17 ng/dl, cholesterol 108 mg/dl, triglycerides 102 mg/dl, LDL (Friedewald estimation) 67 mg/dl, HDL 21 mg/dl. Blood tests at discharge: glucose 153 mg/dl, creatinine 1.69 mg/dl, sodium 134 mEq/l, potassium 5.1mEq/l, chlorine 98 mEq/l, calcium 9.2 mg/dl, NT-proBNP 2640 pg/ml. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle not dilated, with normal wall thickness. Moderately depressed systolic function with alterations in segmental contractility. Non-dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function. Slightly dilated left atrium. Moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension. Coronary angiography: severe lesion in the proximal segment of the anterior descending artery (ADA), which is revascularised with drug-eluting stent. Mammary anastomosis permeable and without lesions. Non-dominant circumflex, giving a first OM occluded from the origin, with distal filling by homocoronary circulation. Saphenous graft and right coronary artery not probed as they were previously occluded.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient had a good clinical and analytical evolution (initial NT-proBNP of 10053 pg/ml and final of 2640 pg/ml) after starting combined diuretic treatment (furosemide, chlorthalidone and 3-day cycle of acetazolamide given the tendency to metabolic alkalosis). A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed deterioration of ventricular function compared to the previous study; in addition, the patient reported episodes of typical chest pain both at home and during admission, so coronary angiography was performed, revealing severe stenosis in the proximal segment of the LAD, which was revascularised by implanting a drug-eluting stent. She was maintained on triple antithrombotic therapy with ASA, clopidogrel and dabigatran 110 mg during hospitalisation, and ASA was withdrawn on discharge. Given the analytical finding of poor chronic metabolic control of his type 2 DM (Hb glycaemia 7.2%), it was decided to introduce an iSGLT2 (empagliflozin) for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events despite acute renal failure of probably mixed origin (pre-renal and contrast nephropathy), with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at discharge calculated according to the CKD-EPI formula of 43 ml/min/m .  DIAGNOSIS Congestive heart failure in anasarca. Moderate left ventricular dysfunction. Type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor chronic metabolic control (HbA1c 7.2%) and macro and microvascular involvement. Three-vessel coronary artery disease: severe stenosis of the proximal anterior descending artery, revascularised percutaneously by means of a drug-eluting dsetent implant. Ischaemic stroke secondary to left carotid artery occlusion, revascularised by stent. Initial NIHSS of 9. NIHSS at discharge of 2. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): diabetes mellitus 2 (DM2). No known hypertension or dyslipidaemia. Toxic habits: ex-smoker (previously smoked 1.5 packs/day from the age of 12 to 46 years). No current drinker, previously a weekend drinker of 5-6 beers and 4-5 drinks. No previous cardiological history. Surgical interventions: conisation in 2010. Previous home treatment: metformin 850 mg/12 hours.  Current illness 50-year-old woman, ex-smoker, with no previous cardiological history, who for the last 4 months, in relation to exertion, has had episodes of non-radiating central thoracic oppression associated with dyspnoea, without accompanying vegetative cortex and relieved by rest. These episodes were initially triggered by heavy exertion, and the level of exertion at which they appear has progressively decreased, with these changes being more pronounced in the last two weeks. They now appear with small efforts (walking more quickly or climbing stairs). Curiously, she does daily bicycle exercise of about 30 minutes without the onset of symptoms. Given that the baseline electrocardiogram showed complete left bundle branch block (LBBB), exercise testing was ruled out and the patient was admitted to cardiology to complete the study.  He denied orthopnoea or episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND). There was no increase in peripheral oedema or reduction in diuresis. She reported weight gain in recent months. No syncope/presyncope.  Physical examination Good general condition, well hydrated and perfused, conscious and cooperative at all times. Clinically and haemodynamically stable on admission to the cardiology ward. Afebrile. Blood pressure 136/81 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones at a good frequency. No murmurs were heard. Respiratory auscultation: good vesicular murmur without pathological noises. Abdomen: soft, depressible, without visceromegaly or other noteworthy findings. Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 78 bpm. PR 160 ms. Normal axis. Wide QRS (120 ms) with LBBB image. Secondary repolarisation alterations. Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index not increased in size. No images of pulmonary condensation. Free costophrenic sinuses. Analysis: Glucose 143 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.84 mg/dl. Urea 41 mg/dl. Sodium 148 mEq/l. Potassium 4.8 mEq/l. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 148 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 62 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 68 mg/dl, triglycerides 90 mg/dl. Normal liver profile. Normal thyroid hormones. Glycated haemoglobin: 7.3%. No mobilisation of myocardial damage markers: peak ultrasensitive cTnT 9 ng/dl. Haemogram with 4,990 leucocytes (normal formula), Hb 13.2 g/dl and 203,000 platelets. Coagulation normal. Echocardiography: moderately dilated left atrium (LA) (42 mm AP diameter; Vol 42 ml/m2). Normal mitral valve morphology, with fibrocalcification of the posterior annulus and 2) restriction of the posterior leaflet mobility, with central insufficiency grade II (ORE 0.15 c.m.) Dilated left ventricle (DTD 61 mm; DTS 48 mm; VTD 197 ml; VTD index 98 ml/m2; VTS 120 ml), normal myocardial thickness (septum 6 mm; pp 7 mm). LVEF 40% calculated by Simpson Biplane, with akinesia of the basal and middle segments of the septum and inferior face, as well as hypokinesia of the anterior face, with better contractility of the apical segments and lateral-inferior face. GLS -15% with more diminished values in the septal and inferior segments. Mitral filling E/A 1.3: E 108.7 cm/s; A 84 cm/s; e' sept 5.15 cm/s; e' lat 8.7 cm/s. E/e' 15 . Trivalve aortic valve, with preserved opening and closing, without insufficiency. Annulus 20 mm. Sinuses of Valsalva 32 mm. Right ventricle (RV) of normal dimensions (RVDVD 29 mm), with preserved systolic function. TAPSE 26 mm. S' 12.6 cm/s. Trivial IT that does not allow estimation of pulmonary gradient. Pulmonary flow with acceleration time of 110 ms. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated, with adequate inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. Conclusions: 1) dilated cardiomyopathy with moderate dysfunction and the described contractility alterations. 2) Diastolic dysfunction (dilated LA, E/e' >14; e' <10). 3) Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) grade II. 4) RV with preserved systolic function. Coronary angiography: right radial access. Angiographically normal coronary arteries. Right dominance. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): normal relationships and anatomical arrangement of the central cardiovascular structures. No interatrial septal defects or anatomical alterations in cardiac valves. Normal systemic and pulmonary venous drainage. Systolic area AD 20 cm2; left atrium 21.6 cm2 (4C plane estimate). Right ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic, without alterations in segmental contractility, with preserved systolic function (EF 66 %). Dilated left ventricle (dTD 61 mm; VTD 126.2 ml/m), without alterations in segmental thickness (images 4-5). No alterations in segmental thickening were observed. Dyssynchronous movement of the septum with respect to the non-septal wall of the LV, attributable to HH bundle branch block, to be correlated with ECG findings. Moderately depressed systolic function (EF 40%).Jet of central mitral insufficiency. Estimated regurgitant fraction between 13.6% (by calculation from ventricular volumes) and 17.8% (by calculation from LVlat and aorta). In the black myocardial sequences, a subtle linear intramyocardial enhancement is recognisable in the basal and middle septum, as well as in some areas of free wall, especially in the lateral and lower middle basal wall. Assessment in several sequences is very limited by respiratory motion. Conclusions: non-ischaemic left dilated cardiomyopathy, associated with moderate systolic dysfunction (LVEF 40%). Dyssynchronous movement of the septum. Non-coronary late enhancement pattern, as described above. Compatible with sequelae of myocarditis. Mitral insufficiency (RF 13.6%-17.8%).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On admission, after echocardiography detected findings of dilated cardiomyopathy with the segmental alterations described, the next step in the diagnostic algorithm was coronary angiography, which ruled out the presence of coronary artery disease. In view of this, cardiac MRI was requested for the aetiological study of the ventricular dysfunction, the result of which suggested a non-ischaemic origin of the condition (with a pattern of enhancement compatible with the sequelae of myocarditis). The response during admission to depletive treatment was adequate, and treatment with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was initiated, with good tolerance and consequent disappearance of the symptoms that led to admission. On discharge from hospital, treatment was prescribed with enalapril 5 mg/12 hours, spironolactone 25 mg/24 hours and bisoprolol 2.5 mg/12 hours. As for anti-diabetic treatment, the patient was under treatment with metformin 850 mg/12 hours and, despite this, she had a glycosylated haemoglobin of 7.3%, above the target recommended by the guidelines in patients such as the one we present (7%). In this regard, dapagliflozin was added based on the results of cardiovascular efficacy obtained with this drug in recent studies on patients with heart failure. In addition, in order to improve adherence to treatment, both hypoglycaemic drugs were prescribed in a single presentation: metformin 850 mg/dapagliflozin 5 mg every 12 hours. After discharge, the patient remains asymptomatic 11 months later and has not had any new hospital readmissions to date. In addition, the last blood test showed an objective decrease in HbA1c to 6.5%, below the recommended target level.  DIAGNOSIS Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with moderate dysfunction (EF 40%) probably in the context of old myocarditis. Coronary arteries without angiographically significant lesions. DM2 without optimal control (Hb1Ac 7.3%). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (CHA2DS2-VASc = 7) in treatment with acenocoumarol. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Stroke in 2010, without sequelae. Stage 3a chronic kidney disease (secondary to diabetic nephropathy). Deep vein thrombosis in lower limbs in 2006. Usual treatment: insulin glargine 10 IU at dinner; atorvastatin 10 mg; acenocoumarol 4 mg as prescribed; tiotropium bromide 18 mcg 1-0-0; alogliptin/metformin 12.5/1,000 mg 1-0-0; ranolazine 375 mg 1-0-1.  Present illness 83-year-old male under follow-up in cardiology for stable angina. The patient reports that despite adjustment of medical treatment, he persists with oppressive precordial pain, radiating to the jaw and left arm, which is triggered when he climbs more than two flights of stairs and which disappears after approximately 5 minutes' rest. No dyspnoea, palpitations or syncope. The last transthoracic echocardiogram showed a left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 38%, akinesia of the lower basal and middle segments with thinning of the wall and an image of scarring. He was referred to our hospital for catheterisation.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 150/95 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 70 bpm. Oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented, eupneic, well perfused.  Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur with no extra sounds. Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm with PR 280 ms, QRS 140 ms with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and secondary repolarisation alterations. CBC: haemoglobin 12.4 g/dl. Leukocytes 8,700 μl N 82.3%. Platelets 163,000 μl. INR 1.1. Creatinine 1.85 mg/dl. Glomerular filtration rate 45 ml/min/1.73 m. Sodium 140 mmol/l. Potassium 3.6 mmol/l. AST 377 IU/l. ALT 88 IU/l. Alkaline phosphatase 48 IU/l. GGT 30 IU/l. Total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dl. CK 1018 IU/l. Protein 5.3 g/dl. HbA1c (NGSP) 7.9%. Total cholesterol 100 mg/dl, HDL 26 mg/dl, LDL 48 mg/dl, triglycerides 133 mg/dl. Chest X-ray: CTI within normal limits, lung parenchyma without alterations. Echocardiogram on admission: left ventricle with ejection fraction 38%, akinesia of lower basal and middle segments with wall thinning and scar image. Hypokinesia of the inferolateral side. Coronary angiography 1: multivessel coronary artery disease. Chronic occlusion of the middle right coronary artery (RCA). Severe atheromatosis of proximal-middle anterior descending artery (AD), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and implantation of overlapping drug-eluting stents. Severe atheromatosis of proximal circumflex artery (Cx) - first obtuse marginal (OM1) treated with drug-eluting stent implantation. Acute stent thrombosis resolved during the procedure. Coronary angiography 2: proximal Cx stent thrombosis with new implantation of two drug-eluting stents. Echocardiogram at discharge: left ventricle with ejection fraction 28%, extensive inferoposterolateral akinesia, with anterior hypokinesia. Moderate-severe ischaemic mitral regurgitation.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Catheterisation programmed due to angina and ventricular dysfunction. Prior to the procedure, the patient was being treated with acenocoumarol, which was discontinued 48 hours before admission, and 250 mg of acetylsalicylic acid was administered without the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor, pending confirmation of the need for percutaneous coronary revascularisation. Coronary angiography revealed a severe lesion in the proximal LAD, a moderate-severe lesion in Cx-OM1 and chronic occlusion of the LMCA, with little likelihood of viability in its territory. Clopidogrel 600 mg was administered and revascularisation of the LAD and Cx was performed. She presented with periprocedural AMI due to hyperacute thrombosis of the Cx stent and treatment was started with IV cangrelor. Admitted to the coronary unit, presenting acute heart failure, acute pulmonary oedema with arterial hypotension, requiring oxygen therapy with high-flow glasses, perfusion of furosemide and noradrenaline at low doses. In addition, renal function deterioration was observed with a pre-renal component and in relation to contrast nephropathy. After 48 hours of admission, the patient presented an episode of self-limited sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) followed by several bouts of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with ST-segment depression in V3 to V6. In view of these findings, a repeat diagnostic coronary angiography showed thrombosis of the Cx stent, which was revascularised, with a new cangrelor perfusion and a change in antiplatelet therapy from clopidogrel to ticagrelor. He was subsequently transferred to the hospital ward where he presented good clinical evolution, without new episodes of arrhythmias, with improvement in renal function (GFR 48 ml/min). He was discharged with triple antithrombotic therapy with rivaroxaban 10 mg daily, adiro 100 mg daily and ticagrelor 90 mg every 12 hours for 1 month; to continue with double therapy with rivaroxaban 10 mg and ticagrelor 90 mg for 6 months and then only with rivaroxaban 15 mg daily if the GFR remained below 50 ml/min.  DIAGNOSIS Ischaemic heart disease, CCS class II stable exertional angina with moderate LV systolic dysfunction. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Coronary angiography: coronary arteries with diffuse atheromatosis without significant lesions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In the history prior to admission, the patient had taken a certain amount of hypoglycaemic drugs over the previous 4 years: Until 2015 the patient was taking metformin 1000 mg every 12 hours, with poor follow-up and therapeutic adherence during years of illness. At the end of that year, after visiting the health centre, his primary care doctor managed to recover some follow-up and associated insulin therapy: Lantus SoloStar 100 IU/ml, 30 IU in the morning, and referred him to the endocrinology department. In February 2016, he had an Hb1Ac of 10.8%, BMI of 40 and weight of 110 kg, eGFR of 55 ml/min/1.73 m, so the endocrinologist implemented a diabetology education course, and changed Lantus to Novomix 30/70 at 20-20-18 IU breakfast-lunch-dinner, while associating metformin/vildagliptin 50/1000 mg every 12 hours. June 2016, insulinisation takes effect and Hb1Ac is reduced to 8.5%. BMI remains at 40. Novomix 30 is maintained, increasing the doses to 26-26-24 IU breakfast-lunch-dinner. The analysis showed a GFR estimated by CDK-EPI of 40 ml/min/1.73 cm2, so it was decided to discontinue metformin/vildagliptin 50/1000 mg, maintaining only metformin 1000 mg/24 hours. In June 2017 during admission to cardiology for an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation, associated with tachycardiomyopathy. Hb1Ac is 7.1%. The eGFR had decreased by 28 ml/min/1.73 m . Metformin was discontinued. In February 2018 after cardiology review she had fully recovered LVEF. Renal function had improved (eGFR 51 ml/min/1.73 m2). Hb1Ac 8.3%. BMI was still 40. Discussion with endocrinology, the patient's profile is optimal for starting a GLP1 analogue: diabetic with > 10 years of evolution, with metabolic syndrome, obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m2) and previous cardiovascular disease. It was decided to start dulaglutide 0.75 mg weekly subcutaneously and progressively increased to 1.50 mg weekly, without gastrointestinal side effects, with good adaptation and tolerance to the drug. Metformin was restarted at the same time. Novomix therapy was maintained. Six months later, the patient was reviewed and reported a weight loss of 5 kg, he was more animated, with Hb1Ac 7%. Metformin was again discontinued due to reduced glomerular filtration rate. Returning to the current cardiology admission in 2020, the patient presented adequate clinical evolution in hospitalisation after intravenous diuretic treatment, improving from the point of view of heart failure. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing a dilated left ventricle (DTd 6.3 cm; VolTd 203 ml) with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF by Simpson bp 29%) and transmitral pattern suggestive of pseudonormalisation with high filling pressures. Right ventricle with slightly reduced systolic function (TAPSE 15 mm). Biauricular dilatation. No significant valvular heart disease. No pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography with diffuse atheromatosis in the coronary arteries without significant lesions. It was therefore interpreted as suggestive of a priori non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy decompensated by rapid AF, and outpatient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested to complete the study. He was treated with amiodarone 200 mg/24 hours orally, remaining in sinus rhythm, without new falls in atrial fibrillation. In the admission blood test, Hb1Ac was 8.1%. The BMI was 39.7. On discharge, as this was a male with a clear metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus with poor control, the treatment was optimised as much as possible, and as an option, treatment with dulaglutide was replaced with semaglutide 0.5 mg weekly (and progressively after 4 weeks the dose was increased to 1 mg) in an attempt to improve weight loss and metabolic control, maintaining the same insulin units, as blood glucose levels during admission were in range and his HbA1c was >8%. Metformin is not associated as the glomerular filtration rate at discharge is 39 ml/min by CDK-EPI, with urine albuminuria of 146 mg/g. Finally, atorvastatin 40 mg/24 hours, which the patient was taking, was replaced by rosuvastatin 20 mg/24 hours. Over the last 4 years, the patient has undergone various hypoglycaemic treatments, with frequent changes, mainly due not to side effects but to variable renal function. The advantage of GLP1 analogues is that they are not limited by this fact. CKD is often present in long-standing diabetic patients with poor control, since, as we know, diabetic nephropathy is one of their vascular complications. This can lead to frequent changes in medication, which are associated with treatment errors and poorer long-term adherence of patients to medications. To get the most benefit from therapy, it is important to know the indications, limitations, adverse effects and to tailor the decision of which drug to prescribe to the patient's profile.  DIAGNOSIS Type 2 diabetes mellitus that is difficult to control. Metabolic syndrome. Heart failure with reduced LVEF. Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy decompensated by rapid AF (associated tachycardiomyopathy component). Persistent cardioverted persistent atrial fibrillation electrically anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. Stage IIIb A2 chronic kidney disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION This is a patient with chronic ischaemic heart disease and a bicameral CCM, who presented progression of his angina to minimal effort angina, as well as deterioration of functional class, associated with the appearance of severe left ventricular dysfunction (previously preserved LVEF), for which it was decided to admit him to cardiology for study and treatment. During his stay in the cardiology ward, depletive and antianginal treatment was administered, with a progressive decrease in dyspnoea, without new episodes of chest pain, tolerating ambulation. Coronary angiography showed progression of the non-revascularisable coronary artery disease, so it was decided to optimise the antianginal and heart failure medical treatment. Spironolactone and sacubitril/valsartan were started without incident. Given the presence of poorly controlled diabetes associated with obesity and difficult-to-control hypertension in a patient with ischaemic heart disease and heart failure, it was decided to add liraglutide 0.6 mg daily to the treatment and the statin dose was increased. Given the iron deficiency anaemia, treatment was associated with intravenous ferrotherapy, with a good response. At hospital discharge, BP 100/66 mmHg, HR 84 bpm, SatO2 99%, in a state of euvolemia. He was admitted to the heart failure unit for close outpatient monitoring. After 3 months, severe ventricular dysfunction persisted and cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) was decided given the contribution to the dysfunction of continuous RV pacing (pacemaker-dependent patient). After 6 months of optimal medical treatment titrated to maximum tolerated doses and 3 months of CRT implantation, the patient was re-evaluated clinically, analytically and echocardiographically. The patient presented NYHA I without symptoms of heart failure or signs of pulmonary or peripheral congestion, normalisation of ventricular function, absence of chest pain and adequate blood pressure control at home. Significant weight loss (BMI 28) and marked improvement in glycaemic control were also confirmed, reaching target HbA1c. The patient has had no new decompensations or admissions during the current 2-year follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Main diagnosis: Chronic ischaemic heart disease.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Patient aged 43 years with no personal or family cardiological history. Active smoking of 1 pack/day, no other toxic habits. No recent trips. No regular medication.  Current illness Patient referred from the emergency department of a regional hospital for an abrupt picture of language alteration, with subtle nominative difficulties, paraphasia and fragmented and incoherent speech together with a tendency to somnolence of 12 hours of evolution. The previous day the patient had been skiing, without incident. A cranial computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan was performed, showing only an old left subthalamic infarction, and a lumbar puncture, with normal biochemistry (according to protocol, PCR for viruses was not indicated). On suspicion of an evolving cerebrovascular accident (CVA), he was referred to our hospital. On arrival he was assessed by the emergency department. In the anamnesis, the family commented that they had had a mild upper respiratory catarrh two months ago, which had resolved. However, our patient had presented with a persistent non-productive cough for the last 30 days, which she did not attach particular importance to. In addition, in the last week, intolerance to decubitus together with slight oedematisation of the extremities, all compatible with cardiac decompensation. A joint assessment by neurology and cardiology was requested.  Physical examination Initially, the patient was assessed neurologically. Of note: Hypofluent language, with subtle nominative disorder, isolated phonetic paraphasia, with preserved repetition and execution of complex commands. Emotional lability with a tendency to cry, fluctuating. Slightly reduced attentional spaming with alteration of working memory and minimal tendency to pronation without claudication of the right upper extremity. MIS 0/8. The rest of the neurological examination was normal. Subsequently, the cardiology examination was performed: Blood pressure (BP) 152/100 mmHg, tendency to sinus tachycardia, oxygen saturation with nasal goggles at 3 bpm 95%. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic at 95 bpm, third sound, systolic murmur in mitral focus. Pulmonary auscultation: crackles to right midfield and left base. Abdomen without semiology of ascites, hepatomegaly of medial predominance of two traverses. Jugular ingurgitation +. Slight bimalleolar oedema in decubitus. Urine toxins, enterovirus, RSV and influenza serology were requested, all negative. Admission to cardiology with joint management by both specialties.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 93 bpm, normal PR, QRS 90 ms, QTc 416 ms. Sokolow-Lyon criteria for LVH. Negative T wave in III, AVF, V5-V6. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, signs of vascular redistribution. Pinching of both costophrenic sinuses in relation to small bilateral pleural effusion. Blood tests: urea 29 mg/dl, creatinine 1.02 mg/dl, calcium 8.2 mEq/l, magnesium 2 mEq/l, chlorine 108 mEq/l, sodium 137 mEq/l, potassium 3.9 mEq/l, GGT 70 U/l, GOT 84 U/l, GPT 111 U/l, total bilirubin 1.58 mg/dl, leukocytes 7300/mm, haemoglobin 12.9 g/dl, haematocrit 37.5%, platelets 173000/mm, prothrombin activity 95%, NT-proBNP 12396 pg/ml, CRP 2.66 mg/dl, ultrasensitive troponin I 1346 ng/l, D-dimer 2511 ng/ml. Negative urine toxins. Lumbar puncture: biochemistry 5 red blood cells, 0 nucleated cells, chlorine 130, glucose 0.68, protein 0.37. Gram: no microorganisms found. Bacterial culture negative. Microbiology: nasopharyngeal swab negative for influenza, enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Rectal smear negative for enterovirus. CT scan of the brain on admission: midline structures centred. Symmetrical ventricular system of normal size and morphology. Cortical sulci, peritroncular cisterns and cranial base without alterations. No haemorrhagic lesions were observed. Bedside echocardiogram on admission: dilated left ventricle (LV) (LVED 60 mm) with normal wall thickness, severe ventricular dysfunction with estimated LVEF 15-20%. Global hypocontractility with no clear contractile asymmetries. Mitral valve (MV): thickened leaflets, tenting of both leaflets leading to severe secondary or functional mitral regurgitation. Competent aortic valve. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size, good longitudinal function but CAF 25%. Severe PI. Mild TR allowing estimation of RV-RA gradient 35 mmHg. Dilated inferior vena cava with abolished inspiratory collapse, moderate pulmonary hypertension. Minimal pericardial effusion lamina Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: craniovertebral junction of normal morphology. No midline abnormalities detected. Posterior fossa of normal configuration. Ventricular system of normal size and morphology. Base cisterns free. Vascular structures of correct configuration, dural venous sinuses permeable. T2 signal alteration in the left thalamic region with a distribution suggesting lacunar infarction by lenticulostriate artery, with almost complete restitution of diffusion. It suggests subacute infarction. A small subcortical T2 hypersignal is detected in the right insula, in the posterior frontal cortex, predominantly in the left hemisphere and in the right occipital juxtacortical white matter. Some small diffusion brightening is observed in the left frontal cortex, indicating acute cortical infarction at present. Conclusion: subacute lacunar infarction in the left thalamic region and acute cortical microinfarcts in the left posterior frontal cortex. Cardiac MRI: poor image quality and impossibility of completing the study due to the patient's neurological condition. Dilated LV with severely depressed LVEF (20%). Failure of isovolumetric relaxation. Normal myocardial thickness and global hypocontractility. No oedema/swelling in myocardial thickness. Late enhancement not acquired because the patient was unable to complete the examination. Right ventricle of normal size with mild hypocontractility. Atria of normal size. Pericardial effusion 10 mm thick. Echocardiogram at discharge: moderately dilated left ventricle with normal thickness (DTDVI 60 mm, indexed VTD 94 ml/m2). Moderate LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF estimated by Simpson biplanar 35%). Global hypocontractility. Pseudonormal diastole. Slightly dilated A.I. MV: thickened cusp leaflets (4 mm). Dilated annulus (38 mm). Preserved opening with posterior leaflet restriction. MI of central origin with jet directed towards the posterolateral wall of LA reaching the roof of the same, without reverse systolic flow in PVs with decreased systolic component (VC 6 mm, estimated ORE 0.30 cm2 and RV 51 ml), which by all data is estimated in grade III/IV. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Tricuspid valve normal in structure and function. Mild TR. Non-dilated IVC with preserved inspiratory collapse. Estimated normal PAPs. Left and right catheterisation: coronary arteries without angiographically significant lesions. Normal pulmonary pressures. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB): insufficient material. Myocardial fragments with preserved structure. Interstitial inflammatory infiltrate consisting of neutrophilic polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes, without myocyte damage. There were polymorphonuclear cells/mm2 and 3 CD3+ lymphocytes/mm. Viral PCR negative. Echocardiogram at follow-up 6 months after discharge: LV indexed slightly dilated, normal wall thickness. Global systolic function preserved (LVEF 60%), without regional contractile abnormalities. Both atria of normal size. RV of normal size and function. MV: preserved opening, mild MI. Estimated pulmonary pressure normal. Absence of pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the multidisciplinary management during admission, the neurological and cardiological evolution of our patient will be differentiated:  Neurological evolution MRI was requested on admission showing a lesion compatible with left anterior thalamic infarction and EEG with no findings of interest. She remained alert and cooperative, mild bradypsychia, and showed some despair when faced with cognitive tests when she could not remember. MOCA 16/30, mainly in TE orientation, language fluency and delayed counting. Reads, but does not achieve full comprehension. Maintains some abstract thinking. Pending assessment by neuropsychologist after discharge. Subsequent periodic neuropsychological studies should be carried out in order to determine whether there is an evolutionary recovery of the cognitive disorders or to conclude her diagnosis as thalamic vascular dementia.  Cardiological evolution Admission with frank heart failure with orthopnoea, bilateral pleural effusion, hepatomegaly and oedema. Treatment was started with levosimendan and furosemide with progressive improvement of congestive signs. Once stabilised, given acute HF of < 3 months of evolution with a history of upper respiratory tract infection, a cardiac MRI was performed which estimated severely depressed ventricular function (LVEF 20%), with no evidence of myocardial oedema, limited by the impossibility of administering gadolinium given the patient's neurological condition. Subsequently, coronary angiography was performed, with no lesions, right catheterisation showing normal pulmonary pressures and PVR and endomyocardial biopsy of the RV. The biopsy showed an interstitial inflammatory infiltrate consisting of polymorphonuclear (6/m) and CD3+ T lymphocytes (3/mm2) but myocytes with preserved structure. Echocardiogram at discharge showed improvement in ventricular function, estimated at 35%. Once stabilised, neurohormonal treatment was started with sacubitril/valsartan, carvedilol and spironolactone, pending a new control echocardiography three months after discharge, which showed complete recovery of ventricular function and normalisation of repolarisation in the patient's ECG.  DIAGNOSIS Dilated cardiomyopathy with recovered severe ventricular dysfunction; suspected acute myocarditis (borderline). Congestive heart failure of subacute onset. Left thalamic stroke of cardioembolic origin: strategic location for cognitive impairment. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History  Male, 73 years old, independent, with an active life. No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: ex-smoker until 30 years ago of about 30 packs/year. High blood pressure (HBP) under pharmacological treatment with good control. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) treated with oral medication with good control. Dyslipidaemia under pharmacological treatment. No alcohol habit. Previous cardiological history: diagnosed in October 2017 due to episode of oppressive chest pain of degenerative aortic valve disease with double lesion (severe aortic stenosis and moderate aortic insufficiency), ascending aortic aneurysm (52 mm) and 1-vessel coronary artery disease (diffusely diseased DC with poor distal bed). In February 2018, valve replacement was performed, with a number 21 Magna Ease biological aortic prosthesis and a Hemashield No 28 supracoronary tube.  Other history: Duodenal ulcus requiring Billroth II gastrectomy. Synchronous lower rectal and pulmonary neoplasia in 2016. Received radio and chemotherapy; subsequently pulmonary lobectomy and rectal resection. Grade II chronic lower limb ischaemia due to femoropopliteal obstruction in MID and distal popliteal stenosis in MMII. Neurinoma of the left acoustic nerve causing hypoacusis in the left ear, therapeutic attitude pending decision.  Usual treatment: rosuvastatin 10 mg (0-0-1), clopidogrel 75 mg (0-1-0), omeprazole 20 mg (1-0-0), oxycodone 5 mg 1 cp c/4h sp, paracetamol sp and lactulose sp.  Present illness 73-year-old patient admitted to neurology in April 2019 for diplopia and gait instability. In the previous month, he had presented with a general syndrome with weight loss and asthenia, accompanied by febrile fever. Twenty-four hours after admission to neurology to complete studies, having previously been asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view, he began with oppressive central thoracic pain with electrocardiographic changes: right bundle branch block (RBBB) not previously seen and ST elevation on the anterolateral side. The infarction code was activated and loading doses of antithrombotic treatment were administered. A few minutes later, he presented complete atrioventricular block with bouts of prolonged asystole and haemodynamic instability, so orotracheal intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation was performed. He required noradrenaline to maintain blood pressure. On arrival at the haemodynamics ward, a transient pacemaker was placed via the right femoral vein and a coronary angiography was performed showing 100% stenosis of the anterior descending artery as the vessel responsible for the infarction. Primary angioplasty and pharmacoactive destent implantation was performed with good angiographic results. He was then admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit.  Physical examination On admission to neurology: Neurological examination: unstable gait with lateropulsion to the right, right palpebral ptosis and diplopia in various gaze positions. Blood pressure (BP) 135/73 mmHg. Oxygen saturation (SatO2) 97% basal. Temperature 37.4 oC. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, without added noises. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic with systolic murmur II/VI in aortic focus. Abdomen soft, depressible and non-painful. No oedema in the lower limbs.  On admission to the cardiac ICU: SAPS-3 (Simplified Acute Physiology Score-3): 76 points (67.4% probability of death on admission). BP 115/56 mmHg with noradrenaline perfusion at 0.7 μg/kg/min. Heart rate (HR) 70 bpm. Temperature 36o C. SatO2 100% (FiO2 0.5). Respiratory rate (RR) 19 rpm. Under sedoanalgesia, pupils half reactive. Upper limb flexion (MMSS) to algesic stimulus. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, without added noises. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic with systolic murmur II/VI in aortic focus. Abdomen soft and depressible, not painful on palpation with preserved peristalsis, with no signs of peritoneal irritation. No masses or megaliths were palpable. The lower extremities were well perfused, with preserved and symmetrical pulses, with no signs of deep vein thrombosis.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Cranial CT scan without contrast: no signs of bleeding, compressions or displacements in the endocranial structures visualised. Hypodense lesions in the periventricular white matter with a subacute ischaemic appearance. Laboratory tests: blood biochemistry: glucose 255 mg/dl, urea 49 mg/dL, creatinine 0.95 mg/dl, CK 5,955 U/l, TnT 14,890 ng/l. Haemoglobin 9.3 g/dl, haematocrit 27.4%, leucocytes 14,550/mm (neutrophils 91.9%), platelets 149,000/mm. Coagulation: PT 61%, TTPa 15.9 s, fibrinogen 432 mg/dl. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with chest pain: sinus rhythm at 97 bpm. BRDHH. ST elevation on the anterolateral side. Emergent coronary angiography: Implantation of a transient balloon pacemaker via right femoral vein. Left main coronary artery: no stenosis. Anterior descending: 100% stenosis, TIMI 0 flow in proximal segment. Circumflex: no stenosis. Right coronary artery: severe stenosis of 99% in its distal segment and 100% stenosis in its middle segment, with impression of chronic occlusion, with bad distal bed. Primary angioplasty: via the right femoral artery, with JL4 guidewire, guidefloppy is advanced to the distal LAD, recovering arterial flow. Subsequently, direct implantation of a Resolute Onyx 3.5 x 22 mm drug-eluting device was performed in the proximal segment with success and without complications. Good angiographic result and final TIMI 3 flow. Transesophageal echocardiography: Study performed in ICU with patient on mechanical ventilation. Biological prosthesis in aortic position with a large wart (about 24 mm), multilobulated and irregular, which moves from LVOT to aorta with the cardiac cycle. Mild valvular insufficiency. Peak gradient of 43 and mean of 30 mmHg (previous 14 and 6 mmHg) with VTI ratio 0.26. Perivalvular aortic abscess extending to mitro-aortic junction. Moderate-severe mitral insufficiency due to de-structuring of the valvular annulus in relation to abscess in the mitro-aortic junction. Severe systolic dysfunction due to extensive akinesia of all apical segments, anterior face and mid-septal and basal segment of anterior septum. No pericardial effusion. Blood cultures: taken on admission. Multisensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the cardiac ICU in shock with high suspicion of infective endocarditis due to febrile fever, being a biological prosthesis holder and the characteristics of the lesion of the anterior descending artery suggesting embolic origin. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on admission and progressed to transesophageal echocardiography which confirmed the diagnosis of late prosthetic infective endocarditis. In addition, the results of the blood cultures taken on admission were positive for multisensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis. Joint assessment with cardiac surgery. Given the situation of cardiogenic shock, emergency surgery was ruled out. Despite antibiotic treatment, inotropes at increasing doses and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation implantation, the patient was unable to overcome the shock situation. Acute renal failure, in anuria. Haemofiltration was performed, without improvement. He developed multi-organ failure and finally died.  DIAGNOSIS Death due to late prosthetic infective endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, complicated by: Previous STEMI in haemodynamic Killip-Kimball IVs(cardiogenic hock). 2-vessel coronary artery disease.

HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 42-year-old man who was admitted to cardiology for a first episode of heart failure, with a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. His personal history includes abuse of various intoxicants (GHB [gamma-hydroxybutyric acid], mephedrone and methamphetamines on a regular basis; occasional cocaine; smoker of 10 cigarettes a day; occasional testosterone cycles). He is HIV positive with good immunovirological control under treatment with dolutegravir/rilpivirine, and had syphilis which was correctly treated. He came to the emergency department for one week of progressive dyspnoea until he became resting, associated with orthopnoea and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. She also presented with neurological symptoms consisting of dyschromatopsia and retroocular headache. She had not suffered from chest pain, palpitations or other cardiovascular symptoms. Physical examination revealed the presence of jugular venous engorgement, with a gallop rhythm in the third tone and crackles up to midfield on pulmonary auscultation.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus tachycardia at 125 beats per minute. Narrow QRS, axis deviated to the left. Poor R growth in precordial leads. Flattened T waves with normal QTc interval. Chest X-ray: increased cardiothoracic index. Signs of pulmonary congestion. Transthoracic echocardiogram on admission: very dilated left ventricle, with severe systolic dysfunction. LVEF 12%. Mobile images in apex, at least 3, maximum 1.8 x 1.0 cm, hypermobile, compatible with thrombi. Dilated right ventricle, with severe systolic dysfunction. Signs of elevated filling pressures. Moderate mitral insufficiency. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory tests on admission: NT-proBNP 15678 ng/dl. Undetectable HIV load.   Cranial computerised axial tomography (CAT): appearance of cortico-subcortical hypodensity in the right PCA territory, probably related to an ischaemic event of uncertain evolution. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): cortical lesions with contrast uptake and mild diffusion restriction suggesting subacute phase infarcts, the largest right basal occipital with haemorrhagic transformation. There are also three millimetric cortical lesions with intense restriction (right frontal, left frontal and right parietal) that also suggest infarcts but with a shorter evolution time. Cardiac MRI: severely depressed biventricular systolic function (LVEF 12%, RVEF 14%). Mild-moderate mitral insufficiency. Severe left atrial dilatation. No intracavitary thrombi. Pathological late enhancement in the insertion region of the right ventricular free wall and linear intramyocardial uptake in the basal septum of non-ischaemic aetiology. Diagnostic coronary angiography: coronary arteries without significant lesions. Genetic study: negative.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION From the point of view of heart failure, the patient evolved favourably with diuretic treatment until complete resolution of the congestive symptoms. Disease-modifying treatment was started with sacubritril/valsartan, low-dose bisoprolol due to suboptimal tolerance, spironolactone and ivabradine. On monitoring, episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were detected, as well as episodes of non-sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Therefore, in view of the negative ventricular remodelling and the presence of late enhancement on MRI, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention. As a study of ventricular dysfunction, ischaemic aetiology was ruled out by coronary angiography and familial aetiology by genetic study; the possibilities were toxic or HIV-associated cardiomyopathy. Regarding antithrombotic treatment, anticoagulant treatment was started on admission with low molecular weight heparins due to the presence of intracavitary thrombi and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. It was discontinued during admission after brain MRI showed haemorrhagic transformation of the cerebral infarction. At discharge, in the absence of new bleedings and once the absence of interactions with antiretroviral treatment had been verified, oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban was started.  DIAGNOSIS First episode of heart failure. Severe biventricular dysfunction. Coronary arteries without significant lesions. Non-sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Intracavitary thrombus (left ventricle), not seen in cardiac MRI after initiation of anticoagulation. Subacute ischaemic stroke in the right PCA territory of probable cardioembolic aetiology, with subsequent haemorrhagic transformation. HIV infection under treatment with good control. Intake of toxic substances. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History We present a 78-year-old male patient, non-smoker, with no known cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) or other toxic habits. In 2013 he presented an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with no alterations in the echocardiogram or ergometry, for which he was discharged. The patient was not anticoagulated as he had a CHA2DS2-Vasc of 1 point at that time. Since then, the patient's only treatment was occasional lorazepam.  Oncological history: In October 2016, the patient started with intermittent dysphonia. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a lung mass in the right hemithorax measuring approximately 33 mm and multiple homolateral hilar and mediastinal hilar adenopathies. A right pleural effusion with multiple pseudonodular images and segmental atelectasis in the middle lobe were also seen. Due to these findings, the patient was referred to the pulmonologist, who performed bronchoscopy with aspiration and positron emission tomography (PET), which confirmed a hypermetabolic mass in the right upper lobe compatible with a primary pulmonary neoplasm. The patient also presented hypermetabolic adenopathies at different levels, including a right supraclavicuar adenopathy, a right pleural effusion and hypermetabolic lesions in the sixth costal arch. Anatomo-pathological study revealed adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung, and genetic analysis identified ALK translocation, which has been found to be strongly associated with the genesis of this type of tumour. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (T2aN2M1) with ALK translocation, and first-line palliative treatment with crizotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was initiated. After two cycles of chemotherapy, a control CT scan showed a partial response with reduction of the lung mass (20 mm), reduction of the size of the paratracheal adenopathies and disappearance of the pleural effusion. From January 2017 to June 2017, he received a total of 6 cycles of crizotinib (500 mg/24 hours) and the patient achieved stable disease. During this period, the patient had no relevant adverse events. Since then, the patient was clinically monitored every month and a follow-up CT scan was performed every six months. He had no adverse effects related to the oncological treatment and the disease remained stable according to RECIST criteria.  Current disease In November 2019, during a follow-up oncology consultation, the patient reported slow but progressive onset of oedema in the lower extremities and weight gain of up to 5 kg in the last few months. He also reported noticing an even slower heart rate than usual, around 30-40 beats per minute without dizziness or syncope, and mild dyspnoea without clear orthopnoea. A follow-up CT scan showed that the lung mass remained stable, but a mild pleural effusion, a laminar pericardial effusion and a periportal hypodensity compatible with oedema were observed. It was decided to temporarily suspend crizotinib, treatment with a loop diuretic was started and the patient was referred to the cardio-oncology department to rule out congestive heart failure.  Physical examination At the first visit to the cardio-oncology department, the patient was hypertensive (187/91 mmHg) and oxygen saturation was normal. Physical examination revealed no jugular plethora but he had hepatojugular reflex and oedema with pitting in both lower extremities. Cardiac auscultation was rhythmic at about 40 beats per minute, with no murmurs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 43 beats per minute, with first degree atrioventricular block and normal QT (QTc 422 ms). No significant alterations were evident in the blood tests: glucose 82 mg/dl, urea 38 mg/dl, creatinine 1.15 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) 60 ml/min/1.73 m , sodium 145 mEq/l, potassium 4.6 mEq/l, magnesium 2.2 mg/dl, albumin 3.8 g/dl, cholesterol 177 mg/dl, haemoglobin 14 g/dl, leucocytes 4.41 x 103/ml, platelets 149 x 103/ml. NT-proBNP was determined once diuretic treatment had been started and the patient's clinical situation had improved, and the value was 115 pg/ml (normal range 0 to 300 pg/ml). An echocardiogram was also performed and showed mild to moderate septal hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (estimated LVEF 58%). The aortic root was mildly dilated (42 mm ascending aorta) with mild aortic and mitral valve regurgitation. The left atrium was mildly dilated. The right ventricle was normal in size and function. There was mild tricuspid regurgitation without significant pulmonary hypertension, and mild pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After the first visit, the patient's condition was suspected to be heart failure secondary to bradycardia. Bradycardia is a common cardiovascular adverse effect of crizotinib, which can also cause heart failure. According to the Framingham criteria for heart failure, the patient met two major and three minor criteria. The diagnosis was further supported by echocardiographic findings of mild-to-moderate septal hypertrophy with preserved LVEF and mild pericardial effusion. Differential diagnosis was made with other entities that could cause systemic congestion: Systemic congestion can be caused by both renal disturbances and nephrotic syndrome. The association between lung cancer and paraneoplastic syndromes is frequent, including nephrotic syndrome. As we can see from the laboratory results, the patient's renal function was normal and albumin and cholesterol were within normal ranges. Liver failure can also be a cause of oedema, but the patient had no history of ethylism, and both bilirubin and liver enzymes were normal. It should also be noted that venous compression due to tumour progression could cause oedema in the lower extremities. However, no abdomino-pelvic or inguinal adenopathies were seen on the follow-up CT scan in October 2019. Some medications that are part of the different oncological treatments can cause systemic congestion (e.g. corticosteroids, analgesics such as ibruprofen, naproxen...). Our patient, however, was not receiving treatment with any of them. By the time the patient was referred to the cardio-oncology department, crizonitib had already been discontinued and the loop diuretic was started. Since then, the patient progressed favourably, losing up to 2-3 kilograms. In addition, enalapril 5 mg/24 hours daily was started due to the hypertension observed in the consultation. The patient was finally diagnosed with symptomatic bradycardia secondary to crizotinib and congestive heart failure with preserved LVEF. After one week of treatment the patient lost 5 kg and had no congestive signs. He also reported an increased heart rate. Holter blood pressure monitoring showed that the patient had grade 1 hypertension, and treatment was adjusted. The loop diuretic could be withdrawn because the patient evolved favourably, the congestive signs resolved, no serious heart disease was observed in the tests performed, and his heart rate was around 60 beats per minute. After a multidisciplinary consultation, and considering the spectacular response he had previously shown, it was decided to restart crizotinib with close monitoring.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure with preserved LVEF secondary to sinus bradycardia. Sinus bradycardia secondary to crizotinib. Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with ALK translocation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O

Other history: Irritable colon. Migraine. Usual medication: Does not take any medication.  Present illness The patient came to the emergency department due to oppressive chest pain of great intensity, which started at rest, radiating to the left arm, unchanged with inspiratory movements, accompanying vegetative symptoms. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient had been in pain for more than an hour, with no improvement since onset. He reported symptoms of precordial oppression with exercise since 3 months earlier. No symptoms suggestive of catecholaminergic release.  Physical examination On arrival at the ED he was afebrile, normoperfused, with chest pain. SatO2 96% on room air, blood pressure 123/84 mm/Hg, heart rate 92 l/min. Neck: symmetrical, no jugular ingurgitation or hepatojugular reflux. No murmurs on carotid auscultation. Cardiac auscultation: regular heart sounds without murmurs or extratonos. Pulmonary auscultation: vesicular murmur present, well ventilated fields, no extra sounds. Abdominal examination: nondescript. Lower limbs: symmetrical, no signs of DVT or oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS  Blood count: haemoglobin 17.2 g/dl, haematocrit 49.5%, red blood cells 5.66x10 , leukocytes 21,800, neutrophils 11,570, lymphocytes 8,270, eosinophils 520, platelets 429,000. Biochemistry: glucose 124 mg/dl, urea 37 mg/dl, creatinine 1.19 mg/dl, glomerular filtrate > 90 ml/min/1.78 m , sodium ion 142 mmol/l, potassium ion 3.2 mmol/l, troponin T 7 ng/l, creatine kinase 225 U/l, urate 6.8 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 121 U/l, AST 37 U/l, ALT 59 U/l, GGT 45 U/l, total bilirubin < 1.0 mg/dl, total cholesterol 98 md/dl, HDL 41 mg/dl, triglycerides 43 mg/dl, calculated LDL cholesterol 49 mg/dl, HbA1C 5.6%, TSH 2.33 mU/l. Coagulation: normal in all parameters. Urine toxicity: benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids and methamphetamines negative. Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 80 L/min, normal PR interval, narrow QRS, normal axis at +40, ST-segment elevation up to 3 mm on the anterolateral side with mirror image on the inferior side. Coronary angiography: CD artery without angiographic lesions. Cx artery without angiographic lesions. DA artery with thrombotic occlusion in its middle third, immediately distal to the exit of the first diagonal. Angioplasty: with XB 3.5 Sion is advanced to distal DA recovering flow. Due to abundant thrombotic content, tirofiban is administered i.v. (bolus + perfusion). Direct implantation of a Synergy 4 x 20 mm drug-eluting stent was performed in the mid-proximal segment. Due to an image of under-expansion at mid-stent level, post-dilatation with a 4.5 mm NC balloon was performed, achieving adequate expansion. A thrombus floating distal to the stent was found floating intra-arterially, so it was decided to perform thromboaspiration with a Pronto device, extracting a large red thrombus. Excellent angiographic result after thromboaspiration and final TIMI 3 flow. Echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with extensive anterior, anteroseptal and lateral akinesia (middle segments and apical cap) with normal contractility of the inferior territory, infero-lateral and basal inferior septum.   Extended CBC: Serial myocardial damage markers (on admission, at 3 hours, 12 hours and 36 hours, respectively): Ultrasensitive troponin T (ng/l): 7 -> 7.611 -> 9.234 -> 3.215 Creatinine kinase (U/l): 225 -> 3.764 -> 3.546 -> 912 Genetic study for familial hypercholesterolemia: negative. Liporpotein A: 90.7 mg/dl (normal < 30 mg/dl). Chromatography and electrophoresis: acid diuresis: 1.850. Collection time (chromatography): metanephrine 24 hours: 198,7 μg/24 hours. Normetanephrine 24 hours: 377.4 μg/24 hours. Toxicology: metanephrine 30. Normetanephrine 122 Serology antiphospholipid syndrome: anti-cardiolipin IgG and IgM negative (< 1.6 GPL U/ml and 0.8 MPL-U/ml, respectively), anti-beta2 glycoprotein IgM and IgG negative (< 1.4 U/ml and 1.5 U/ml, respectively). Endocrinology consultation: metanephrine and metanephrine levels in urine were normal and plasma levels were only slightly elevated in normetanephrine, which, together with the absence of compatible clinical manifestations, makes the presence of pheochromocytoma or parnaganglioma highly improbable.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION We present the case of a very young 23-year-old patient admitted to cardiology for an acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation (STEACS) in extensive anterior face, for which the heart code is activated. An emergent coronary angiography showed coronary artery disease in one vessel, with thrombotic occlusion of the middle LAD coronary artery, and angioplasty was performed with implantation of a drug-eluting stent, perfusion of tirofiban and aspiration of the remains of the thrombotic material. During his stay on the hospital ward, the patient remained asymptomatic, and the causal study of this acute coronary syndrome was carried out. It is noteworthy that the patient's cardiovascular risk factors were that he was a smoker with a cumulative consumption of less than 1 packet/year, with no other known metabolic disorders. There is a maternal history of ischaemic heart disease and his mother is diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolaemia. The patient underwent a lipid profile analysis which did not show any markedly elevated total cholesterol or LDL values, but rather a low CV risk profile. Urine toxins were requested and were negative, and a study of coagulopathies was carried out, also negative. Serum and urine metanephrines were requested and the patient was referred to endocrinology, who considered that there was a low probability of pheochromocytoma. Finally, it was decided to expand the lipid profile with a lipoprotein A (Lp(a)), which was found to be elevated for cardiovascular risk with a value 3 times the upper limit of normal. The patient evolved satisfactorily, with no clinical signs of heart failure, although on discharge he presented moderate LV dysfunction, due to extensive anterior, anteroseptal and lateral akinesia (middle segments and apical cap).

HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 47-year-old woman with cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, smoking and dyslipidaemia. History of chronic stable angina in functional class II without previous treatment. She consulted a centre in the city of Buenos Aires (Argentina) due to atypical and characteristic precordial pain at rest of 1 hour's duration. Physical examination on admission showed blood pressure (BP) 120/65 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 130 bpm, SatO2 90% on room air. Jugular ingurgitation 3/3 without inspiratory collapse. Rhythmic heart sounds, no murmurs. Regular ventilatory mechanics at the expense of tachypnoea and use of accessory muscles, generalised hypoventilation and regular bilateral air entry, with intolerance to decubitus. Good peripheral perfusion with positive symmetrical pulses. Bilateral malleolar oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus tachycardia at 130 bpm, PR 120 ms, QRS 80 ms. ST-segment depression less than 1 mm in DII, DIII, aVF and from V3 to V6. Initial Q wave in DI and aVL with ST elevation of 1 mm. CBC: haematocrit 29%, haemoglobin 9.5 g/dl, leukocytes 19,500/μl, platelets 212,000/μl. Baseline coagulation, renal function and ions normal. Myocardial damage markers: Troponin T US 15 ng/l and 24 ng/l (normal 0-14 ng/l). CK/CK-MB: 550/180 IU/l. Cardiac catheterisation: right dominance. Right coronary artery without lesions. Patent anterior descending and circumflex arteries, with non-significant lesions in the middle third. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) not dilated, mild LV systolic dysfunction. Parasternal short axis shows pseudoaneurysm in the lateral aspect of the LV. No significant valvular heart disease. Chest X-ray: left paracardiac radiopacity probably compatible with the location of the ventricular pseudoaneurysm, bilateral pleural effusion. Chest CT scan: saccular image on the lateral aspect of the LV compatible with ventricular pseudoaneurysm.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 130 bpm with high lateral subepicardial lesion (image 1) and positive troponin, so emergency coronary angiography was performed, showing patent arteries with non-significant lesions in the anterior descending and circumflex arteries, so angioplasty was not performed and medical treatment was started. After 72 hours, the patient presented with new precordial pain of intensity 10/10, and an ECG was performed with no changes with respect to the previous one and negative biomarkers. An echocardiogram was performed which revealed a ventricular pseudoaneurysm in the lateral aspect of the left ventricle, for which urgent referral to our centre for cardiovascular surgery was requested. Chest X-ray showed left cardiac radiopacity compatible with probable pseudoaneurysm and chest CT scan showed a large saccular formation measuring 59 x 68 x 75 mm depending on the lateral wall of the LV, contained by pericardium and connected by an orifice to the myocardium with the presence of thrombi adhering to the inner wall of this formation, associated with haemopericardium and bilateral pleural effusion, predominantly on the right. Emergency surgery was performed with closure of the aneurysm neck, placement of a Dacron patch and Prolene reinforcement at the edge of the rupture (image 6). In the immediate postoperative period, the patient presented hypovolemic shock and subsequent right ventricular failure, which evolved favourably with volume expansion and inotropic drugs. Prior to discharge, a new echocardiogram was performed which showed good ventricular function, with slight pericardial effusion.  DIAGNOSIS Acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation (STEMI) in the upper lateral face. Coronary arteries without acute thrombotic occlusion. Ventricular pseudoaneurysm as a mechanical complication, with signs of imminent rupture and requiring emergency surgical repair. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 77-year-old man who, after eating fresh fish, developed severe anaphylaxis requiring the administration of intramuscular adrenaline with subsequent chest pain and ST-segment elevation, accompanied by clinical and laboratory data of low cardiac output.  History No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: ex-smoker, hypertension (HT), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), high blood pressure. No known heart disease or bronchopathy. Chronic ischaemia syndrome of both lower extremities, grade IV. Transphalangeal amputation of the second toe of the left lower extremity (IBD) in June 2017. Amputation of the fourth toe of the right lower extremity (EID) in October 2018. Infracondylar amputation of EID on 26/08/2019. Previous surgical interventions: cataract of right eye. Usual treatment: insulin glargine, 20 units at dinner; metformin 850 mg, 1 tablet every 12 hours; sitagliptin 50 mg, 1 tablet every 12 hours, repaglinide 1 mg, 1 tablet breakfast, lunch, dinner; acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, 1 tablet at lunch; enalapril/lercanidipine 20/20 mg, 1 tablet at breakfast; atorvastatin 20 mg, 1 tablet at dinner; allopurinol 300 mg, 1 tablet at breakfast; etoricoxib 120 mg, 1 tablet per day; metamizole 575 mg; paracetamol 1 g, on demand. Baseline functional status: cognitive functions preserved. Wheelchair-bound due to recent infracondylar amputation of DID. No angina or dyspnoea in his usual life.  Present illness A 77-year-old man, who after having dined on fresh hake and clams, started after 4 hours with generalised erythema, intense palmo-plantar pruritus, genital pruritus and tongue oedema with slight dysphonia. On arrival of basic life support, he was administered intravenous dexchlorpheniramine and Actocortin (i.v.), despite which, on arrival at the emergency department of his hospital of reference, he persisted with slight pruritus and notable tongue oedema, so it was decided to administer adrenaline 0.5 mg intramuscular (i.m.), starting instantly with intense chest pain radiating to the left upper limb. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed showing anteroseptal ST elevation with specular decrease in the inferior face, which did not improve after sublingual nitroglycerine, with accompanying signs of low cardiac output (arterial hypotension, acral coldness and obnubilation), so continuous perfusion of dobutamine (DBT) and noradrenaline (NAD) was started. Suspicion of ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEMI) anteroseptal Killip IV, the infarction code was activated and the patient was transferred to the haemodynamics ward of our hospital for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). On arrival, the patient was conscious and oriented, affected by pain, under continuous perfusion of NAD (at 0.8 mcg/kg/min) and DBT (at 5 mcg/kg/min) with a tendency to arterial hypotension (blood pressure [BP] 75/50 mmHg) and sinus tachycardia (heart rate [HR] 120 bpm). The ECG showed persistent anteroseptal ST elevation, and on arrival echocardiography, moderate LV dysfunction with akinesia of all mid-apical and anterior segments. He was transferred directly to the haemodynamics ward. Time of onset of chest pain: 5:15 am. Time of arrival at the emergency room: 5:30 am. Time of opening of the artery: 7:08 hours. TIMI risk scale: 12 points (35.9%). CRUSADE risk scale: 59 points, 19.5% (high haemorrhagic risk).  Physical examination On admission to the coronary unit BP 75/50 mmHg; HR 120 bpm; baseline SatO2 95%; afebrile. Somnolent. Poor distal perfusion with lividity in the lower extremities and acral coldness. Head and neck: no jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no clear audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: bibasal crackles. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, normal hydro-aural sounds. Lower extremities: amputation of the DID, no oedema in the lower extremities, palpable left foot.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG in the emergency department of the regional hospital: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, long PR, right bundle branch block (RBBB), ST elevation of V1-V5, I and AVL, maximum of 9 mm in V3, with specular decrease in inferior face. ECG on admission to the coronary unit: sinus tachycardia at 115 bpm, long PR, persistent ST elevation in precordial leads, maximum of 6 mm in V3. Chest X-ray: cardiac silhouette not enlarged, vascular redistribution, free costophrenic sinuses, no apparent condensation. Laboratory tests on admission to the coronary unit: Arterial blood gas: pH 7.27, PCO2 31 mmHg, PO2 90 mmHg, HCO3 14 mmol/l, lactate 4.5. Biochemistry: urea 80 mg/dl, creatinine 0.96 mg/dl, GPT 14 U/L, total bilirubin 0.3 mg/dl, sodium 134 mEq/l, potassium 5 mEq/l, CRP 16 mg/l, CK 138 U/l, LDH 450 U/l, ultrasensitive troponin T 118 ng/l (normal < 14). CBC: haemoglobin 10.5 g/dl, platelets 469,000, leucocytes 31,000 (with 86% neutrophils). Coagulation: aPTT > 180 sg, INR 1.2. Enzyme peak: peak CK 779 U/l, peak troponin T 2016 ng/dl. Other analytical results: HbA1c: 7.5%. TSH: 1.01 (in range). Lipid panel: total cholesterol 102, triglycerides 112, HDL 33, LDL 47. Laboratory tests requested by the allergology department: tryptase curve (9/9/2019): Regional hospital: 24; 4 hours after onset of symptoms: 11; 24 hours: 10; (normal tryptase value undetectable, or < 1.2 mg/l). IgE: 190.00 kUA/L (elevated); Anisakis Ac.IgE: 36.90 kUA/L (very positive). Urgent catheterisation: short common trunk with non-significant distal atheromatosis. Anterior descending (AD): subtotal ostial lesion in the AD, with the rest of the vessel with mild atheromatosis, TIMI 2 flow. The 1st and 2nd diagonals present moderate ostial stenosis. Circumflex (Cx): proximal moderate lesion and distal moderate long atheromatosis. Right coronary artery (RC): dominant. Mild proximal-moderate atheromatosis and severe short lesion at the level of the IVP cross-ostium. Primary PCI: the severe lesion of the ostial LAD is pre-dilated with a 3.0 mm balloon and a 3.5/24 mm ANGIOLITE stent is implanted from ostial CT with an optimal result. The most distal LAD at the apical level is occluded and does not recover flow after PTCA at the level of the 2.0 mm balloon occlusion. Echocardiogram on admission: left ventricle (LV) neither dilated (DTD 45mm) nor hypertrophic (IVS 9mm, PP 9mm) with moderately depressed global systolic function at the expense of akinesia of all mid-apical segments with hypercontractility of the rest. Non-dilated right ventricle (RV), preserved global function with apical akinesia. Sclerosed aortic valve with preserved opening, without functional alterations. Sclerosed mitral valve with slight restriction of the posterior leaflet and moderate mitral insufficiency, directed towards the posterior wall of the left atrium (LA). Normal appearing tricuspid valve with mild mitral insufficiency (MI) and RV-AD gradient 25-30 mmHg. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with inspiratory collapse (estimated PSAP 30-35 mmHg, no pulmonary hypertension). No pericardial effusion. ECG at discharge from the coronary unit: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, long PR, axis at -60a, LBBB + HAIHH. Second-time catheterisation with PCI to CD: after advancing the guidewires to PL and IVP, a RESOLUTE 2.5 x 15 mm direct drug-eluting stent is implanted in distal Cd-IVP, leaving slight under-expansion, so it is post-dilated with a 2.5 x 8 mm NC balloon with a good final result. The LP was caged, with no ostial lesion. The PVI, distal to the stent, is diffusely atheromatous with severe distal small vessel lesions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient is admitted to the coronary unit after emergent catheterisation where severe bivascular coronary artery disease with acute thrombotic lesion of the ostial LAD is detected and treated with a stent in the LAD-CT with good results. Immediate haemodynamic improvement was observed and dobutamine could be discontinued in the haemodynamics room. He was admitted to the coronary unit in a stable condition and was able to completely discontinue noradrenaline 2 hours after admission. On admission, he reported some residual mild chest discomfort that resolved in the first 4 hours. Suspicion of anaphylaxis (tongue oedema, pruritus, etc.) led to serial tryptase determinations during the first 24 hours, which were positive. He was maintained during his admission to the coronary unit with corticoid and intravenous dexchlorpheniramine (Polaramine) with complete resolution of genital itching and tongue oedema in the first 12 hours, remaining asymptomatic thereafter. He was assessed by the allergology department, which analysed him for specific IgE and found elevated IgE for Anisakis and negative IgE for hake and clams. According to the recommendation of the allergology department, the intravenous glucocorticoid doses were reduced and Polaramine (antiH1) was maintained throughout the hospital stay until 5 days after the acute event. She was also forbidden to eat fish or seafood until further assessment by her after discharge from hospital. Haemodynamically, he remained stable during the 48 hours of admission with a tendency towards asymptomatic mild hypotension (TAS 90-100 mmHg) and sinus tachycardia (95-110 bpm), without new exploratory or analytical data of low perfusion, with moderate LV dysfunction persisting at discharge, and the introduction of beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) not being possible due to mild hypotension. Spironolactone is started, with good tolerance. Respiratory status remained stable, with the appearance on the first day of admission of mild heart failure (bibasal crackles) without dyspnoea or desaturation. A daily dose of oral furosemide was started and was well tolerated. He presented a single febrile peak up to 38.3oC without shivering on the third day of admission (11/9/2019) with no clinical evidence of infection. Samples were taken for culture (blood/urine culture) and empirical amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was prescribed. During his admission, he was assessed by the vascular surgery department for evaluation of the recent surgical wound of amputation of DID, the wounds were found to be in a good state of healing with some necrotic spots but with no evidence of infection, and intradermal suture removal was pending. Once the condition had stabilised, it was decided to transfer the patient to the ward for evolutionary control and to perform a new catheterisation in the second stage, with PCI to CD-IVP, which was successful. During his stay on the ward, the patient remained haemodynamically and respiratory stable, asymptomatic, and after re-evaluation by the allergology service, the patient was discharged with an outpatient appointment for joint follow-up by allergology and cardiology.  DIAGNOSIS Main diagnosis: Killip IV STEACS (Kounis syndrome type II). Severe Anisakis anaphylaxis (in the context of fresh fish ingestion). Severe two-vessel coronary artery disease: DA and CD. Acute thrombotic lesion in ostial LAD with severe stenosis. Primary PCI with drug-eluting stent implantation in TC-DA axis. Second stage PCI with drug-eluting stent implantation in DC-PVI with moderately depressed LVEF.  Secondary diagnoses: Cardiovascular risk factors: ex-smoker, AHT, DM2. Grade IV chronic ischaemia syndrome of the LVES. Recent postoperative infracondylar amputation of DID. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cardiological history: medical records show detection of a heart murmur more than 20 years ago in check-ups by a primary care doctor, never studied. Other relevant medical history: locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the left breast at the age of 38, treated with radical mastectomy, lymphadenectomy and chemoradiotherapy, free of disease since then with no recurrences. Usual treatment: simvastatin 20 mg every 24 hours.  Present illness On arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported a clinical picture of approximately 4 weeks of progressive deterioration of functional class to the point of presenting dyspnoea at rest (NYHA IV), as well as orthopnoea that forced her to sleep in a sitting position. She also reported a subjective decrease in the volume of diuresis, without associated swelling of the lower limbs. She had no anginal chest pain either at rest or on exertion. He denied any infectious symptoms when questioned by apparatus.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 122/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 100 bpm, O2 Sat 95% with FiO2 35%. Jugular venous pressure increased (15 cm). Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, with systolic murmur in aortic focus radiating to IV/VI carotid arteries, with abolition of the second sound. Systolic murmur in mitral focus radiating to axilla III/VI. Pulmonary auscultation: mediobasal crackles. Abdomen: soft and depressible, not painful on deep palpation, no masses or megaliths, Blumberg and Murphy negative. Positive hepatojugular reflux. Extremities: no oedema in the lower extremities, peripheral pulses preserved and symmetrical, no signs of phlebitis. Echoscopy was performed at the bedside in the emergency department, which showed calcification of the aortic valve with severely limited opening, as well as calcification of the mitral valve apparatus with significant regurgitation, so it was decided to admit the patient to the cardiology ward for stabilisation, complete the study and assess therapeutic options.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Portable chest X-ray on admission: cardiomediastinal silhouette not assessable. Left costophrenic sinus impingement. Prominent pulmonary hilarity with a vascular appearance. Signs of vascular redistribution. Electrocardiogram: sinus tachycardia at 110 bpm. Normal PR. Normal axis. Voltage criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy. QRS 120 ms with intraventricular conduction disturbance type BRI. Signs of systolic overload.  Laboratory tests on admission: Haemoglobin 16.2 g/dl, no leukocytosis or left shift, platelets 232 x 10^9/l. Haemostasis: INR 1.2, APTT 30.1 sec. Biochemistry: glucose 127 mg/dl, creatinine 1.00 mg/dl, GFR 55.8 ml/min/1.72 m, sodium 137 mEq/l, potassium 3.5 mEq/l, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dl, GOT 45 IU/l, GPT 35 IU/l, C-reactive protein 0.1 mg/dl. Blood tests after clinical deterioration: Haemoglobin 15.4 g/dl, no leukocytosis or left shift, platelets 195 x 10^9/l. Haemostasis: INR 1.9, aPTT 40 sec. Biochemistry: glucose 150 mg/dl, creatinine 1.94 mg/dl, GFR 25.1 ml/min/1.72 m, sodium 143 mEq/l, potassium 4.2 mEq/l, total bilirubin 2.7 mg/dl, GOT 150 IU/l, GPT 263 IU/l, C-reactive protein 2.3 mg/dl. Echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with mild concentric hypertrophy. Global hypokinesia of septal and anterior predominance with severely depressed GSF (LVEF 25%). Dilated left atrium. Double aortic lesion on severely calcified valve: severe stenosis (planimetry 0.5 c,mGm 52 mmHg). Moderate regurgitation (THP 260 ms). Moderate mitral regurgitation (II-III/VI) on sclerodegenerative valve (ERO by PISA 0.25 cm2). RV with non-enlarged diameters and preserved GSF (TAPSE 18 mm). Moderate tricuspid regurgitation that allows estimating PsAP at 70 mmHg. Inferior vena cava (IVC) plethoric. Coronary angiography 1: calcification of ascending aorta, intensely calcified sigmoid arteries with reduced opening, severe stenosis (peak gradient 55 mmHg). Coronary arteries: normal trunk. Anterior descending artery with 80% lesion in the middle segment. Circumflex artery with irregularities without stenosis. Right coronary artery with 90% lesion in proximal segment. Thoracic CT without contrast: marked calcified atheromatosis in the thoracic aorta, especially in the location of the aortic button. Calcification of the aortic valve, tricuspid valve and right coronary artery. Coronary angiography 2: percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was performed on the LAD and RCA lesions with implantation of everolimus-eluting drug-eluting stents, with good angiographic results. TAVI implantation: after balloon valvuloplasty, a 23 mm SAPIEN ULTRA prosthesis was implanted. After implantation, electromechanical dissociation without identifying coronary occlusion, contrast extravasation to the pericardium, aortic rupture or prosthetic embolisation.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After admission to the cardiology ward, the patient initially evolved favourably, but subsequently presented clinical deterioration due to a new increase in dyspnoea associated with a marked decrease in the volume of diuresis (< 10 ml/kg/h) and hypotension (BP 73/35 mmHg), so that in view of the situation of cardiogenic shock it was decided to admit her to the coronary unit for stabilisation. Vasoactive support was started with noradrenaline at 12 mcg/min and inotropic support with dobutamine at 10 mcg/kg/min, as well as intensive diuretic therapy with iv perfusion of furosemide at 20 mg/h, with an initial favourable response that allowed negative balances to be maintained without the need to start ultrafiltration therapy. The echocardiographic study confirmed the presence of severe ventricular dysfunction and severe aortic stenosis (and moderate aortic regurgitation) and diagnostic coronary angiography detected severe two-vessel coronary artery disease, as well as significant calcification of the ascending aorta, which was confirmed by non-contrast thoracic CT. With these findings, the case was presented at the medical-surgical session, and surgical valve replacement by the HEART Team was rejected given the patient's clinical situation, with an excessive surgical risk (EuroSCORE II 80.35%), as well as her anatomical characteristics, with very marked aortic calcification that unacceptably limited the possibilities of cannulation for extracorporeal circulation. In addition, given the presence of at least moderate aortic regurgitation, aortic balloon valvuloplasty as a bridge to TAVI was ruled out and it was decided to initially stabilise the patient in the OCU and, depending on the evolution, to consider two-stage treatment with percutaneous revascularisation of the coronary lesions and subsequent percutaneous aortic valve replacement. During his stay in the OCU, the evolution was slowly favourable and, after treatment with IV levosinendan, inotropic support could be withdrawn, requiring only vasopressor support with low doses (0.1 - 0.2 mcg/kg/min) of NA. Percutaneous revascularisation of the AD and DC lesions was performed. Finally, percutaneous valve replacement via the right femoral artery was attempted, and after expansion of the bioprosthesis, the patient presented cardiac arrest due to electromechanical dissociation, with no immediate complications derived from the technique (coronary occlusion, pericardial contrast extravasation, aortic rupture, or prosthetic embolisation), so advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were started, resulting in exitus after 40 min without achieving recovery of spontaneous circulation.  DIAGNOSIS Double sclerodegenerative aortic lesion: severe stenosis and moderate regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation on sclerodegenerative valve. Severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 25%). Ischaemic heart disease: two-vessel disease: CDp 90%, DAm 80%. PCI with implantation of two everolimus-eluting drug-eluting stents. Porcelain aorta. Cardiogenic shock. Failed percutaneous aortic bioprosthesis implantation due to death during the procedure. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Rest of the study unchanged with respect to the transthoracic echocardiogram. Transesophageal echocardiogram (haemodynamic monitoring): transseptal ultrasound-guided puncture was performed without incident. A first clip was implanted in a central position that clearly limited the eversion of the A2 scallop, with moderate residual insufficiency persisting in the medial region. It was decided to implant a second clip medial to the first, with good results. The overall insufficiency after the procedure was considered grade II (mild-moderate), with gradients of around 3 mmHg, without haemodynamically significant stenosis. After removal of the material, an atrial septal defect with diameters of 11 x 5 mm was observed by 3D planimetry, with predominant right-to-left Doppler shunt, which was finally sealed with a 12 mm Amplatzer device, leaving a residual, non-significant intradevice minimohunt. Good left ventricular systolic function after the procedure, with no pericardial effusion. Transthoracic echocardiogram (pre-discharge): severely dilated left atrium. Severely dilated right atrium. Mitral valve closure by means of two mitral clips that behaves as a double residual lesion: mild-moderate mitral insufficiency and mild mitral stenosis. The right ventricle is moderately dilated with preserved systolic function. Left ventricle with moderate hypertrophy, not dilated and with hyperdynamic contractility (LVEF 73%). Ascending aorta slightly dilated. Double aortic valve lesion mild. Severe tricuspid insufficiency. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Closure of atrial septal defect (ASD) secondary to intervention by means of Amplatzer percutaneous device without residual shunt. No pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION This is a patient under cardiological follow-up for his valvular heart disease, consisting of severe mitral insufficiency, who was referred to our clinic preferentially due to worsening functional class and recent admission for heart failure. At this time, mitral valve treatment is being considered. Taking into account the patient's comorbidities (moderate surgical risk, EuroSCORE II 4.46%) and history of pulmonary resection with severe chronic lung disease, he was considered the best candidate for percutaneous mitral valve treatment. Thus, the patient is admitted on a scheduled basis for the procedure. It is performed in the cath lab under general anaesthesia and monitored by transesophageal echocardiography. Two mitral clips are released with reduction of the mitral regurgitation grade to mild-moderate (grade II/IV), maintaining a good opening area without significant increase in valve gradients (mean gradients of 3 mmHg). The procedure was terminated, but when the catheter was removed, the patient presented significant desaturation with hypoxaemia in the arterial blood gas analysis, with the rest of the vital signs remaining stable. The transesophageal echocardiogram showed that the mitral clips had not embolised, biventricular systolic function was good and there was no pericardial effusion. However, a significant right-to-left Doppler flow was observed at the level of the atrial septal defect secondary to the transseptal puncture. The decrease in left atrial pressure as the degree of mitral regurgitation decreased, together with the very high right atrial pressures due to severe pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation, explains this phenomenon. Since the patient persisted with hypoxaemia despite 100% oxygen concentrations on the ventilator, it was decided to percutaneously close the atrial septal defect with an Amplatzer device. The patient's oxygenation improved and he was transferred to the post-surgical critical care unit where he was extubated without incident. In the following days, the patient evolved favourably and did not present any complications at the vascular access level or deterioration of renal function or clinical signs of heart failure. A control echocardiogram was performed which showed good placement of the mitral clips, mild to moderate insufficiency and normal gradients. The patient was discharged from hospital on the fourth day of admission. On subsequent cardiology reviews, he remained clinically stable, in NYHA II/IV with mild heart failure predominantly on the right, which was controlled with a daily tablet of furosemide 40 mg.  DIAGNOSIS Severe organic, degenerative mitral regurgitation, effectively treated percutaneously with the implantation of two mitral clips (MitraClip). Residual mitral regurgitation grade II (mild-moderate). Significant right-to-left atrial septal defect and secondary hypoxaemia. Effective closure of the defect with Amplatzer device. Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension. Preserved left ventricular function. Permanent atrial fibrillation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION He was admitted to our centre on 13/08/2019 in a situation of haemodynamic stability with no data of low CO or decompensated HF. In CF III of the NYHA, INTERMACS 6. Renal function stable with creatinine around 1.7 mg/dl with good diuresis rate under his usual oral diuretic treatment. The iron profile showed ferritin 103 ng/ml with transferrin saturation 14.0% and haemoglobin 11.5 mg/dl, so 1000 mg of iron carboxymaltose were administered. A right heart catheterisation was performed in euvolemic conditions, showing slightly elevated filling pressures with moderate post-capillary pulmonary hypertension with decreased CO (thermodilution: CO 3.41 l/min- CI 1.82 l/min/m. Fick: CO 4.1 l/min-IC 219 l/min/m2) with PVR at the high limit with PWG of 10 mmHg. The patient has been evaluated by the familial heart disease unit as a carrier of the Val26Ala mutation in the emerin gene in heterozygosis (detected in a Sanger). However, the age at presentation and sex raise doubts about a possible secondhit. Moreover, the family history is also inconsistent with the finding of only one emerin, so a complete genetic panel is requested. The genetic study by NGS panel only reports the previously described mutation, with no evidence of a secondhit. In this context, it is possible that the picture corresponds to random X inactivation with involvement (possible but unlikely) in a heterozygous female. For the moment, without other positive results, it is considered that this mutation is responsible for the family history After completing the pre-transplant study, confirming the presence of data on advanced heart failure, and given the absence of significant comorbidity (only stable CKD with mild proteinuria in probable relation to type 2 cardiorenal syndrome) on 23/08/2019 she was presented at the multidisciplinary session and included on the elective waiting list for heart transplant. One month later, the patient was readmitted with decompensation after catarrhal symptoms (sputum culture and rhinovirus negative) with increased dyspnoea of 3 days' evolution until becoming resting and marked orthopnoea without peripheral congestion. During the first weeks of admission, he presented clinical worsening with fine B lines of significant size in the lung ultrasound and data of low postprandial output. For all these reasons, and after optimising diuretic treatment, it was decided to start dobutamine at low doses (2.5 mg) with evident clinical improvement, which was maintained for a week. Subsequently, she received a new course of levosimendan. Given the patient's evolution and the presence of severe MI, she was assessed for MitraClip implantation, which was performed without incident on 16/10/2019, leaving mild to moderate MI. After this, intravenous diuretics were withdrawn and the patient was discharged euvolaemic, without orthopnoea, in CF-II and having observed a decrease in NT-proBNP. ARA-II was reintroduced at low doses with good clinical and analytical tolerance. At discharge, treatment was as follows: candesartan 4 mg (half a tablet) at dinner, hydralazine 25 mg every 8 hours, furosemide 40 mg one tablet at breakfast and another at lunch with a flexible regimen, spironolactone 100 mg every 24 hours at lunch, levosulpiride 25 mg every 8 hours, lormetazepam 1 mg one tablet at dinner, omeprazole 20 mg one capsule at breakfast, Mastical D 1.500/1,000U one tablet every 24 hours and sintrom 4 mg (according to INR control).  DIAGNOSIS Main diagnosis: Advanced chronic heart failure CF III NYHA - INTERMACS 6 due to familial dilated cardiomyopathy (Val26Ala mutation in the EMD gene in heterozygosis) with severe LVSD (LVEF 24%) and included in elective waiting list for heart transplantation.  Other diagnoses: Severe functional mitral insufficiency and moderate functional tricuspid insufficiency. MitraClip holder. Moderate postcapillary pulmonary hypertension. Carrier of ICD-CRT Boston in primary prevention. NSMVT on Holter. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Chronic renal failure (G3A2) due to cardiorenal syndrome type 2. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Obesity grade II (body mass index [BMI] 37 kg/m2). No previous cardiological history. Moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis type (FEV1 51% of predicted), non-exacerbating. Follow-up in outpatient pulmonology department. Stage IIIb colon adenocarcinoma (p3T3N1M0) diagnosed in 2015, treated with laparoscopic right colectomy + adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluoruracil + oxaliplatin which ended in 2017, free of disease with normal serial colonoscopies to date. Benign prostatic hypertrophy. Usual treatment: tamsulosin + solifenacin 0.4/6 mg, 1 tablet per day. Salmeterol + fluticasone 25/250 mcg, 1 inhaled capsule per day.  Present illness Progressive increase in baseline dyspnoea of 2 weeks' evolution (usual CF NYHA II, in the context of bronchopathy) until presenting dyspnoea at rest, associated with orthopnoea that forced him to sleep in a sitting position, oedematisation of the lower limbs and subjective decrease in the volume of diuresis.   Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 137/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 90 bpm, Sat 2O89% on room air. Jugular venous pressure at 12 cm H2O.

Hepatojugular reflux positive Extremities: oedema up to the knees +++/++++, peripheral pulses preserved and symmetrical, no signs of phlebitis. Echocardioscopy performed at the bedside in the emergency department revealed dilatation and biventricular dysfunction, as well as significant mitral regurgitation, so it was decided to admit the patient for stabilisation and study.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm. Narrow QRS, axis at 30o. ST-segment depression of 1 mm from V3 to V5 with negative T wave. Asymmetric negative T wave in lateral face as a sign of systolic overload. Chest X-ray on admission: posteroanterior projection. Increased cardiothoracic index. Free costophrenic sinuses. Prominent pulmonary hilae. Signs of vascular redistribution to upper fields. Laboratory tests on admission: Haemoglobin 14.7 g/dl, MCV 89 fl, MCH 28.3 pg, leukocytes 5.5 x 10`9/l, platelets 183 x 10^9/l. Haemostasis: I. Quick 93.7%, INR 1.1, TTPa ratio 0.95.

Myocardial damage biomarker curve (hsTnI, normal < 19.8 ng/l): 32.6 - 37.8 - 35.4 ng/l. Echocardiogram: moderately dilated left ventricle, with normal thickness. Global hypokinesia, with LVEF 30%. Transmitral filling type relaxation disturbance with estimated normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (E/E' = 7). Severely dilated left atrium. Moderate functional mitral regurgitation with ORE by PISA of 0.2 cm. Sclerosed, normofunctioning aortic valve. Aortic root not dilated. Right ventricle of normal diameters and mild ventricular dysfunction (TAPSE 15 mm). Mild tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating PSAP of 60 mmHg. Inferior vena cava 19 mm with respiratory variation < 50%. Coronary angiography 1: calcified left main coronary artery with 20-30% stenosis distally. LAD with severe proximal and middle disease with stenosis around 80%. Borderline lesion in the ostial circumflex artery (50%) and significant lesion in the first marginal branch. Right coronary artery with 70% lesion in the proximal segment and 50% at the level of the crux cordis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): left ventricle with increased volumes (VTD 107 ml/m, VTS 75 ml/m) with mild eccentric hypertrophy (IMVI 97 g/m2), generalised global hypokinesia and severe depression of global systolic function (LVEF 30%). No myocardial oedema is seen on STIR sequences. Non-dilated right ventricle (RVOT 58 ml/m, STV 33 ml/m) with slightly depressed global systolic function due to generalised hypokinesia (RVEF 43%). Aortic root diameters at the upper limit of normal (sinus portion 38 mm) with moderate dilatation of the tubular portion of 47 mm. Fallen 32 mm. Descending aorta 29 mm. Left atrium slightly dilated (maximum diameter 50 mm, area 15 cm2/m2). Increased pulmonary vascular resistance, estimated at 6 UW (mean pulmonary velocity 8.4 cm/sec). No perfusion defects detected at rest. Necrosis and viability detection study: presence of late gadolinium enhancement suggestive of linear intramyocardial fibrosis at septal-anterior basal and medial level and focal at septal-inferior and inferior basal and medial level, at the LV and RV junction. Coronary angiography 2 (videos 5-7): Impella device is positioned by right femoral access. Angiography is performed via left radial access. Severe LAD lesions are pre-dilated and everolimus-eluting drug-eluting stents 3 x 48 mm and 3.5 x 18 mm are implanted. The distal circumflex guidewire was crossed and IVUS aostium was performed, detecting a luminal area > 6 mm2 and therefore not significant. The lesion was treated in the first obtuse marginal area with a constant everolimus-releasing drug 2.5 x 33 mm with good results. The guidewire was crossed to the distal DC, predilatation of the lesion in the proximal segment and implantation of a 3.5 x 15 mm everolimus-eluting drug-eluting stent. Good result. Finally, the Impella device is removed according to protocol. Femoral haemostasis with Proglide intravascular suture device.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On admission to the cardiology ward, intensive depletive treatment was started, with 40 mg of i.v. furosemide every 6 hours, with excellent response to the same, with dyspnoea disappearing at rest and progressive toleration of ambulation without incident. A regulated echocardiogram confirmed the presence of severe left ventricular dysfunction, so treatment was started with enalapril 2.5 mg daily, bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily and spironolactone 25 mg daily with good tolerance. As part of the aetiological study of the ventricular dysfunction, elective coronary angiography was performed, which revealed 3-vessel disease, with a SINTAX score of 26. The case was presented at a medical-surgical session. Given the patient's comorbidities (moderate-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], obesity, severe ventricular dysfunction, STS score 3.7%, EuroScore II of 6.7%), despite the SINTAX score favourable to surgical revascularisation, it was decided to perform percutaneous revascularisation assisted with Impella device as the procedure was considered high risk, to be performed on an outpatient basis. The patient was discharged with the following medical treatment: acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg per day, enalapril 2.5 mg per day, bisoprolol 2.5 mg per day, spironolactone 25 mg per day, furosemide 40 mg 1 tablet at breakfast and lunch for 2 weeks followed by 1 tablet at breakfast, tamsulosin + solifenacin 0.4/6 mg 1 tablet per day, salmeterol + fluticasone 25/250 mcg 1 inhaled capsule per day, atorvastatin 40 mg per day, pantoprazole 20 mg per day. The importance of weight loss, physical exercise and smoking cessation was stressed. She consulted the emergency department one week after discharge due to palpitations lasting 2 hours, with new onset paroxysmal atrial fibrillation detected on electrocardiogram. A rhythm control strategy was followed, achieving pharmacological cardioversion after an intravenous bolus of 300 mg of amiodarone. At discharge, treatment with apixaban 5 mg every 12 hours was added due to CHADs-VASc of 3 and oral amiodarone 200 mg 5 days a week. Subsequently, percutaneous revascularisation was programmed with mechanical assistance with Impella CP device, which was performed without incident. He received clopidogrel 300 mg the night before admission. After 24 hours of hospitalisation, he was discharged with the addition of clopidogrel 75 mg per day to the aforementioned treatment. After 1 month of triple therapy (ASA + clopidogrel + apixaban), treatment with acetylsalicylic acid was discontinued. Six months after revascularisation, the patient attended a clinical control visit, and was found to be practically asymptomatic for dyspnoea or other symptoms of heart failure, in NYHA functional class I. He is currently awaiting echocardiography. He is currently awaiting a follow-up echocardiogram. No further visits to the emergency department were required due to decompensation.  DIAGNOSIS Acute heart failure due to ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF by cardiac MRI 30%). Three-vessel coronary artery disease with a SINTAX score of 26 points. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (CHADs-VASc = 3, HAS-BLED = 2). High risk device assisted PCI with Impella CP device with complete revascularisation (proximal LAD, mid LAD, distal DC and 1OM with excellent angiographic outcome). Moderate COPD phenotype chronic bronchitis. Smoking on admission.

56-year-old patient with a history of type 2 diabetes and obesity. He was admitted for several weeks of fever, chills, general malaise, vomiting and diffuse pain in the thorax and lumbar region. On examination, the general condition was acceptable, temperature 39oC, and a systolic murmur of intensity II/VI in the mitral focus radiating to the left axilla, while the rest of the examination was normal. Blood tests showed white blood cells 11,400/mm3 (69% granulocytes), platelets 92,000/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 52mm in the first hour, glucose 281 mg/dl, triglycerides 279 mg/dl and alkaline phosphatase 322 IU/l, while the rest of the blood count, biochemistry and coagulation were normal. In the urine, 100 mg/dl protein, 250 mg/dl glucose and 25 red blood cells per field were detected in the sediment. The electrocardiogram showed an anterior haemiblockage as the only abnormality. Chest and spine X-rays, abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography were normal. Echocardiography shows an unstructured mitral valve with prolapse of both leaflets. Blood cultures showed Streptococcus agalactiae, so treatment was started with cefotaxime at a dose of 1 gram every 8 hours intravenously. Initially there was a good clinical response, with disappearance of the fever, but 5 days after starting treatment the patient began to experience palpitations, dyspnoea and orthopnoea, and the fever reappeared. At this time, the systolic murmur was IV/VI, and there was abundant crackles in both thoracic bases. New chest X-rays showed changes highly suggestive of acute pulmonary oedema. Follow-up echocardiography revealed further mitral valve destructuring, vegetations on both mitral valve leaflets and severe mitral regurgitation. Despite intensive treatment with diuretics, vasodilators, synotropic agents, high-dose penicillin and gentamicin, she progressed unfavourably, developed third-degree atrioventricular block, requiring the implantation of a temporary pacemaker, and died about 12 hours after the onset of dyspnoea, while preparations were being made for surgical treatment. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 46-year-old female, civil servant, with no illnesses of interest or regular medication. Never smoked. No cardiovascular risk factors or consumption of alcohol or other toxic substances. No family history of heart disease or sudden death. Intervened tonsillectomy in infancy, caesarean section and hysterectomy. Cardiovascular asymptomatic until the previous 2 weeks, who begins with moderate exertional dyspnoea that prevents her from carrying out her normal life, together with orthopnoea, oliguria and the appearance of progressive oedema in the lower limbs. At all times he denies chest pain, palpitations, dizziness or syncope. Neither did he present febrile syndrome or infectious symptoms. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 130/60 mmHg, a heart rate of 90 bpm, afebrile and eupneic with nasal spectacles at 2 bpm. On auscultation, she had a bibasal crackles and a diastolic murmur II/IV at mitral level with an occasional "plop". Abdomen with no findings and lower extremities with oedema with distal fovea, with no evidence of venous thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, normal PR (152 ms) with bimodal P in relation to left atrial enlargement. Narrow QRS with normal axis without repolarisation alterations. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index with discrete vascular redistribution.    Analyses: Biochemistry: glucose 98 mg/dl (70-110), urea 16 mg/dl [10-50], creatinine 0.78 mg/dl (0.7-1.2), glomerular filtration rate > 60 ml/min (MDRD-4) (> 60), Na 144 mmol/l (135-145), K 3.9 mmol/l [3.5-5.1]. ProBNP 2110 pg/ml (10-125). Normal liver function tests. Thyroid hormones normal. CBC: leukocytes 9,400/cc (normal formula) (4,500-11,400), Hb 14.8 g/dl (13.2-16.8), platelets 211,000 (157,000-334,000). Coagulation: INR 1.13 (0.8-1.3), PT 82% (70-120), aPTT 24.4s (24.8-40.3).  PET CT scan protocol: no repletion defects in the pulmonary trunk or main or segmental branches suggestive of thromboembolism were observed. A well-defined hypodense mass measuring 5 x 4 cm located at the level of the left atrium, which crosses the valve towards the left ventricle, is striking, ruling out myxoma or large thrombus. It is accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions and a linear interstitial pattern, with thickening of interlobular septa compatible with heart failure.  Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) of normal size and thickness, with preserved LVEF (>60%) and no segmental contractility abnormalities. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size and function (TAPSE 20 mm). Moderate left atrial dilatation with a large round heterogeneous mass measuring 5 x 3 cm, adhered to the interatrial septum which in diastole is introduced through the mitral annulus producing a moderate-severe stenosis (maximum gradient of 24 mmHg and mean of 14 mmHg, estimated area of 1.4 cm2), without insufficiency. Aortic and tricuspid valve without significant dysfunction.  Transesophageal echocardiogram: rounded intra-atrial mass measuring 5 x 3.5 cm, heterogeneous, with a wide pedicle measuring 2.7 x 1 cm that adheres to the inferior interatrial septum below the fossa ovalis, which it respects, which in diastole is introduced into the mitral annulus producing a significant stenosis (effective area of 1.4 cm2), with a mitral valve with thin leaflets without alterations. This mass is compatible with an atrial myxoma. The atrial appendage is free of thrombus. Haemodynamic study: coronary arteries without significant stenosis.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient attended the emergency department where, given the presence of dyspnoea in a patient with no known heart disease, it was decided to perform a CAT scan with PET protocol, which ruled out the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism but revealed a striking mass in the left atrium, for which reason cardiology was consulted and admitted to his care as the debut of heart failure. Based on the CT scan findings and pathological auscultation, with a clear clinical suspicion, a transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed the presence of a giant pedunculated mass in the left atrium compatible with a myxoma which, in diastole, protruded into the left ventricle causing significant mitral stenosis. The case was presented to cardiac surgery and it was decided to remove the mass. Intraoperatively, a tumour with a base of implantation inferior to the fossa ovalis in continuity with the posterior mitral annulus was observed and complete excision was performed, including part of the interatrial septum, with subsequent closure of the defect with a patch of autologous pericardium. The mitral valve is morphologically normal, with thin leaflets, and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography shows normal function after removal of the mass.  She was extubated a few hours later without incident and, after a few days, was discharged. The results of the pathological anatomy confirmed the presence of atrial myxoma, with no evidence of malignancy. She is currently being monitored on an outpatient basis by the cardiology department. A follow-up echocardiogram was performed one year later, which showed no abnormalities, with no recurrence of the myxoma, and since then she has been stable and asymptomatic.  DIAGNOSIS Congestive heart failure. First episode. Giant atrial myxoma. Moderate-severe dynamic mitral stenosis. Excision of the mass and repair of the septum with pericardial patch. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Diagonal branch distal to the lesion very developed (double DA system). Circumflex description: normal. Right coronary description: dominant. No stenosis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was initially admitted to the cardiology ward with depletive and disease-modifying treatment for heart failure. In view of the constitutional syndrome, a thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan was requested to rule out concomitant neoplasia. There were no findings compatible with neoplastic disease. However, splenomegaly with foci of splenic infarction was noted. In view of these findings, a repeat TTE was performed, which revealed, in addition to the ventricular dysfunction already observed in the study performed in the previous 3 weeks, a large mobile mass in the pulmonary valve and moderate mitral insufficiency on a valve with a small mass compatible with endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed, confirming the diagnosis, so serial blood cultures were taken and empirical antibiotic therapy was started with vancomycin (20 mg/kg/12 hours i.v.) and gentamicin (3 mg/kg/day i.v.). In the first days of admission, the patient remained very symptomatic, with dyspnoea on minimal exertion and episodes of sudden dyspnoea, although afebrile. Chest CT angiography was performed on suspicion of septic embolism, which was ruled out. The case was discussed at a medical-surgical session and scheduled for surgery. However, the patient evolved unfavourably, presenting an episode of acute pulmonary oedema and requiring transfer to the coronary unit for stabilisation. Progressive blood tests showed significant anaemisation, with a drop to 8 g/dl, requiring transfusion given the clinical condition. In addition, severe neutropenia and thrombopenia were observed (nadir of 100 cells/μl and 31000/l, respectively). Because of this, it was decided to postpone surgery. He was assessed by haematology, started on treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), and a bone marrow aspirate was performed. Due to neutropenia, meropenem 1g/8h i.v. was added to the treatment, with the appearance of a generalised maculopapular rash that forced its interruption. Meanwhile, the result of the aspirate showed no pathological findings, so it was considered that the origin of the haematological alteration could be drug-related, and it was decided to replace vancomycin with daptomycin (10 mg/kg/day i.v.). With this measure and the administration of G-CSF, the patient showed progressive analytical improvement. Coronary angiography was performed as part of the preoperative study, showing a severe lesion in the proximal anterior descending artery, which was left for surgical revascularisation. All blood cultures in standard and special media for fungi and bacteria were negative. Serology and even autoimmunity tests were performed, all of which were negative and the microorganism responsible could not be identified. Nuclear medicine tests were considered in view of the lack of an aetiological diagnosis; however, given the patient's clinical situation, they were not carried out. Finally, clinical stability was achieved, and surgery was performed to replace the mitral and pulmonary valves with biological prostheses. In addition, the pacemaker lead and generator were removed and epicardial leads were implanted in the AD, RV and LV for resynchronisation, with placement of a new generator in the right abdominal subcostal region. Bypass over the LAD was ruled out as the vessel could not be adequately exposed due to the presence of abundant epicardial fat, so percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) over the LAD will be performed at a later date. The valve debris and the distal end of the wire were sent to microbiology. The patient was transferred to cardiac resuscitation, where he progressed favourably, was transferred to the ward and was discharged after 2 weeks, with follow-up in the heart failure unit and arrhythmia unit.  DIAGNOSIS Endocarditis on native pulmonary and mitral valves, with moderate mitral insufficiency with eversion of the anterior leaflet due to rupture of the chordae tendineae. Heart failure with depressed ejection fraction with marked asynchrony due to ventricular electrostimulation. Splenic infarcts secondary to infective endocarditis. Agranulocytosis and thrombopenia of probable drug origin. Toxicoderma due to meropenem. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 59-year-old woman. No known drug allergies. Toxic habits: smoker since youth of 15 cigarettes a day (30 pack-years). Cardiovascular risk factors: no arterial hypertension (AHT), no diabetes mellitus (DM). Dyslipidaemia such as hypertriglyceridaemia. No previous cardiological history.  Other personal history of interest: Hepatic haemangiomas monitored by abdominal ultrasound annually. Primary biliary cholangitis being monitored by the digestive system. Generalised anxiety disorder being monitored by psychiatry. Usual treatment: Ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg 2 tablets every 12 hours, bezafibrate 400 mg 1 tablet every 24 hours, quetiapine 100 mg 1.5 tablets at bedtime, lorazepam 1 mg 1 tablet for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Present illness For 48 hours prior to attending the emergency department, the patient began with clinical symptoms of central thoracic oppression radiating towards the left scapula of intermittent course, which increased with decubitus and coughing and decreased with sitting. She had suffered a catarrhal episode several weeks earlier, which was self-limiting. On the other hand, she also reported intense emotional distress in the last few days. When asked about cardiovascular symptoms in previous months, the patient reported a non-radiating central thoracic pressure that occurred on exertion, lasting several minutes and which subsided with rest, which had been present for about 6 months but which did not exactly remind her of the current pain. No dyspnoea, syncope or other relevant symptoms in the anamnesis by apparatus.  Physical examination Blood pressure 123/83 mmHg; heart rate 77 beats per minute; S02 97% room air; temperature 36.6 oC Conscious and oriented. Well perfused and hydrated. Eupneic at rest. Head and neck: no jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, with pan-focal systolic murmur and no other pathological sounds (no friction sounds). Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful on palpation. No masses or megaliths palpable. No signs of peritoneal irritation.

Chest X-ray performed in the emergency department: cardiomediastinal silhouette preserved, without pleural effusion or gross condensation in the lung parenchyma. Echocardiogram performed on admission to the coronary unit: left ventricle neither dilated (DVItd 37mm) nor hypertrophic (SIVtd 8mm and PPtd 8mm) with prominent septal knee. Moderate-severe systolic dysfunction. Mid-apical akinesia of all faces with hypercontractility of the bases leading to a dynamic gradient in the left ventricular outflow tract of up to 42 mmHg and SAM, resulting in moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. The transmitral flow pattern suggests prolonged relaxation. Trivalve aortic valve with preserved opening and functionally normal. Right ventricle normal in structure and function. Tricuspid valve normal in structure. Mild-moderate tricuspid insufficiency with RV-AD gradient 28 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Dilated inferior vena cava (22 mm) and inspiratory collapse > 50%. Estimated PSAP 38 mmHg. Aortic root of normal size. Echocardiographic contrast is injected in which the presence of apical thrombus is ruled out by this technique. Urgent coronary angiography (videos 4, 5 and 6): right radial access. Truncus, anterior descending and circumflex arteries without lesions. Dominant right coronary artery without lesions (mechanical spasm due to proximal cannulation of the catheter, resolved with intracoronary NTG). Non-dilated left ventriculography with midventricular akinesia on all sides. Moderate mitral insufficiency. Intraventricular gradient of 30 mmHg between apex and LV outflow tract. There is an image of contrast repletion defect at inferoapical level (to rule out intracavitary thrombus with echocardiography). Peak myocardial damage markers: CK 200 U/l, TnT 457 ng/l.

MRI after several months: no myocardial oedema or pathological late enhancements suggesting myocarditis or previous ischaemic heart disease. Biventricular function preserved without alterations of segmental contractility.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival of the patient at the emergency department, the on-call cardiology department was contacted. On anamnesis, the patient reported pain compatible in part with pericardial characteristics (changes in intensity with posture and coughing, previous respiratory infection, etc.) but the type of pain was oppressive and she also reported what appeared to be exertional angina in recent months. On the other hand, the patient reported an emotional upset in the days prior to the onset of the pain. Initial laboratory tests showed elevated markers of myocardial damage (TnT 457 ng/l, CK 200 U/l) and a minimal elevation of CRP (7 mg/l). On the other hand, the ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the inferolateral face with a decrease in the PR and negative T waves in the precordial leads described above. Bedside echocardiography showed the same findings as in the initial echocardiography, i.e. moderate-severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to mid-apical akinesia of all segments together with significant mitral regurgitation due to SAM and presence of aliasing in the left ventricular outflow tract. At that time, we considered several differential diagnoses: inferolateral ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEMI), pericarditis, myopericarditis, tako-tsubo syndrome or a mixed picture. The decision was made to activate the haemodynamics unit to perform an emergent coronary angiography, which did not show coronary lesions that would justify the current picture, so the picture was initially interpreted as a tako-tsubo syndrome that would justify the elevation of the markers of myocardial damage together with the alterations in segmental contractility and associated pericarditis. During her stay in the coronary unit, the patient remained haemodynamically stable with a tendency to arterial hypotension, and neurohormonal medication could not be introduced.  Control echocardiograms showed a disappearance of the gradient and SAM with improvement of LVEF to mild-moderate dysfunction. The control ECG showed a QTc of up to 500 msec without arrhythmic events in the telemetry with subsequent normalisation of the QTc, with persistent symmetrical negative T waves in anterior precordial leads. During her stay in the coronary unit and on the hospital ward, she presented chest pain with pericardial characteristics that subsided after initiation of treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). At the time of discharge, the patient was completely asymptomatic in the anamnesis by apparatus. She was discharged with treatment for her pericarditis with anti-inflammatory drugs and subsequent follow-up by local cardiology. Neurohormonal treatment (ACE inhibitors/ARA-II) could not be started due to a tendency to arterial hypotension. After 3 months, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on an outpatient basis, showing complete recovery of ventricular function with no alterations in segmental contractility and no oedema or late enhancement, thus supporting the diagnosis of tako-tsubo syndrome and ruling out the presence of myocardial damage due to myocarditis or ischaemic heart disease.  DIAGNOSIS Tako-tsubo syndrome. Acute pericarditis. No evidence of myocarditis. Left ventricular outflow tract gradient and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation due to SAM in the context of tako-tsubo syndrome, resolved on discharge. Moderately-severely depressed left ventricular systolic function on admission in the context of tako-tsubo syndrome, with recovery to mild-moderate on discharge. Coronary arteries without significant lesions or anomalous origins. CVRF: active smoker, dyslipidaemia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Other history: biliary colic secondary to cholelithiasis. Usual treatment: nebivolol 2.5 mg each day; eplerenone 25 mg each day; furosemide 40 mg each day; dapagliflozin/metformin 5/1000 mg each 12 hours; fenofibrate 160 mg each day; simvastatin 20 mg each day; amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/160/12.5 mg each day; acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg each day; omeprazole 20 mg each day; gabapentin 300 mg every 8 hours; clorazepate 5 mg each day.  Present illness A 78-year-old male presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnoea in the last month until minimal effort (NYHA III/IV with previous NYHA I-II/IV), associated with oedematisation of the lower limbs (MMII), without orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea or oliguria. In addition, he reported episodes of self-limited chest pain during the last few months, related to exertion, for which he had previously consulted the emergency department, with no electrocardiographic changes or mobilisation of markers of myocardial damage.  Physical examination On arrival at the hospital, the patient was in fair general condition, tachypnoea, blood pressure (BP) 190/99 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80 bpm and SpO2 88%, so supplementary O2, diuretics, intravenous nitroglycerin and bronchodilators were started, obtaining the following constants: BP 170/85 mmHg; HR 70 bpm; SatO2 94% (FiO2 0.26). Cardiac auscultation: regular heart sounds, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: bilateral midbasal crackles and hypophonesis in the right base. Tibiomalleolar oedema in MMII.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Tests performed in the emergency department: Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 63 bpm. PR 200 ms, 0o axis, narrow QRS, ST segment sub-rectification in V4-V6, II and aVF. Chest X-ray: increased cardiothoracic index. Bilateral cottony infiltrates. Right pleural effusion. No condensation was seen.  Laboratory tests: Blood count: haemoglobin 11 g/dl. Haematocrit 32.5%. MCV 86.4 fl. Leukocytes, leukocyte formula and platelets without alterations. Coagulation: no alterations. Biochemistry: glucose 145 mg/dl, urea 77 mg/dl, creatinine 1.89 mg/dl. Ions in range, liver function without alterations. Calcium 8.9 mg/dl. Protein 6.7 g/dl. CRP 1.1 mg/dl. Biomarkers of myocardial damage: hsTnI 22 ng/l --> 30 ng/l. Tests performed during admission: Heart failure markers: NT-proBNP maximum 3258.0 pg/ml. CA 125 17 IU/ml. Echocardiography: left ventricle with moderate concentric hypertrophy of septal predominance, with normal diameters, increased volumes and preserved global systolic function. Normal aortic root and valve. Pseudonormal transmitral filling, with data suggestive of increased end-diastolic pressures (grade II diastolic dysfunction). Normal right ventricle. Inferior vena cava plethora. Mild tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure at 50 mmHg (moderate pulmonary hypertension). Examination in sinus rhythm. Coronary angiography via the left radial artery: mild-moderate stenosis in the proximomedial LAD and proximal segment of the 1st diagonal. It was decided to perform a functional assessment of both lesions with a pressure guide, obtaining negative results both at rest (iFR) and with i.v. regadenoson (FFR). Given chest pain and HF with preserved LVEF, an acetylcholine test was performed. After the second dose (20 mcg), electrocardiographic changes were observed (ST segment elevation and mild negativisation of T waves in V1-V3 and III), diffuse vasospasm of the entire left coronary tree, associated with central thoracic oppression. Signs and symptoms resolved with intracoronary nitroglycerin.  Conclusion: functionally non-significant moderate stenosis in LAD and diagonal. Positive epicardial acetylcholine test.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his stay in the cardiology ward, depletive treatment was administered and, given the results of the coronary angiography, beta-blocker treatment (nebivolol) was suspended and a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (diltiazem) was added. The patient showed clinical and haemodynamic improvement, with resolution of peripheral oedema and dyspnoea, tolerating ambulation without new episodes of chest pain or other complications. Following improvement in renal function, discharge home was decided. During outpatient follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic without dyspnoea or chest pain, with NYHA functional class I.  DIAGNOSIS Acute hypertensive pulmonary oedema in a patient with heart failure and preserved systolic function. Endothelial dysfunction with epicardial coronary vasospasm. Grade II diastolic dysfunction. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Immunohistochemistry: lambda positive. Kappa, A-component, P-component and transthyretin negative. The result of the immunohistochemical study is in favour of AL amyloid.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Patient with no known cardiological history, who had previously presented with periorbital purpura, and who consulted for clinical symptoms of progressive dyspnoea of weeks' evolution. She attended the emergency department and was admitted to the cardiology hospital ward for the first episode of heart failure with evidence of systemic and pulmonary congestion. After an echocardiogram suggestive of deposit disease, it was decided to complement the study with magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac scintigraphy and light chains in plasma and urine. After obtaining the results, a referral was made to the haematology department, which requested an abdominal subcutaneous fat puncture. From the clinical point of view, she responded well to intravenous diuretic treatment; however, she had a tendency to hypotension, and in view of the electrocardiogram with baseline conduction disorder, it was decided not to start treatment with ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. She was discharged stable, in NYHA functional class II/IV, pending anatomopathological results of subcutaneous fat. Two weeks after admission, she returned to the emergency department for chest pain and decompensation of heart failure, and was again admitted to the cardiology ward. Cardiac catheterisation was performed, ruling out associated coronary disease. The anatomopathological result of the subcutaneous fat was in favour of AL amyloid. Diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, haematology started treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone. She remained at home, stable from the cardiovascular point of view, with outpatient monitoring by haematology.  Three months after his first admission, he had an ischaemic stroke of the left hemisphere in the left middle cerebral artery with an image compatible with a small thrombus at the level of the left M1, and was admitted to neurology. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was detected and anticoagulation with heparin and acenocoumarol was started, with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. A gastroscopy was performed with no relevant findings and colonoscopy revealed haemorrhoids. During admission she developed critical patient neuropathy and was transferred to a rehabilitation centre for treatment with low molecular weight heparin, pending outpatient percutaneous closure of the appendage.  DIAGNOSIS AHA/ACC stage C congestive heart failure, with pulmonary and systemic congestion. AL amyloidosis with cardiac involvement. Left hemispheric stroke of probable cardioembolic origin. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Polyneuropathy in critically ill patients. Preserved left ventricular systolic function. Restrictive pattern diastolic dysfunction. Mitral insufficiency grade 2+. Stage 3a chronic kidney disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Male, 68 years old. No known drug allergies. He denies current consumption of toxic substances. Episode of right renal colic in 2010, with discrete ectasia at pyelocaliceal level. Normal renal function.  Cardiological history: Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): arterial hypertension (AHT) and dyslipidaemia on pharmacological treatment. Ex-smoker for 20 years (IPA of 30 packs/year). No diabetes mellitus. Known left bundle branch block (LBBB). Chronic coronary syndrome that debuted in 1986 with AMI, with surgical revascularisation with double aortocoronary bridge (marginal saphenous-obtuse and anterior saphenous-descendant). Subsequently, several episodes of unstable angina in 2002 and 2003, with percutaneous revascularisation: percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with implantation of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD distal to the saphenous graft, two stents in the first proximal-medial diagonal branch, and a stent in the middle DC. In 2010 a new coronary angiography was performed, on a scheduled basis, where a severe stenosis of 70% was observed in distal CT, with stent placement, with a good result. Last control echocardiogram (2018): dilated cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 25%) with moderate-severe mitral insufficiency due to tenting and mild pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the same year: severely dilated left ventricle (LV) with severe dysfunction. LVEF 25.5%. Dyskinesia of the true apex, akinesia of the basal half of the inferior, inferolateral and anterolateral sides, as well as of the basalmost posterior septum. Thinning of the inferior and inferolateral aspect (3 mm). Abnormal septal motion. Non-dilated right ventricle (RV) with preserved global and segmental function. RVEF 52.5%. Mitral insufficiency jet is seen. Late enhancement sequences showed ischaemic enhancement in regions of the basal and medial posterior septum, basal and medial inferolateral, and basal anterolateral. In outpatient follow-up in heart failure consultation, with six-monthly/annual check-ups. Clinically asymptomatic, NYHA I/IV, with no new episodes of angina. Follows cardiac rehabilitation programme. Usual treatment: omeprazole 20 mg, acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day, bisoprolol 5 mg/12 hours, furosemide 20 mg/day, sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg/day, rosuvastatin 20 mg/day.  Present illness The patient consulted the emergency department of our centre due to a progressive increase in dyspnoea during the last week, to the point of minimal effort, associated with orthopnoea and oliguria during the last 3 days. No angina or palpitations. Poor compliance with hygienic-dietary measures during the last few days, with increased water intake. No infections or changes in medication.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 120/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 100 bpm, SO2 90% baseline improving with O2 2 bpm to 95%. Afebrile. Minimal jugular plethora. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic with systolic murmur in mitral focus III/IV, AP with bibasal crackles up to midfields. Abdomen was nondescript. Bilateral oedema with fovea in EEII to pretibial level. In view of symptoms compatible with decompensated heart failure, it was decided to admit the patient to the cardiology department for treatment and clinical evolution.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS In the emergency department: ECG: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, PR 220 ms, with known LBBB, with QRS complex duration of 170 ms. Chest X-ray: borderline cardiothoracic index, with pinching of both costophrenic sinuses, without infiltrates in the lung parenchyma. Blood tests: glycaemia 80mg/dl, urea, creatinine and hepatic battery normal. Na 135 mEq/l, K 4.2 mEq/l. Hb 15 g/dl, leukocytes 4,800, platelets 205,000. Coagulation normal, with INR 1.1. NTproBNP in the ED 1,050 pg/ml. On the cardiology ward: Extended CBC with ferric profile, TSH and HbA1c: ferritin 250 ug/l with TSI 12%. TSH normal. HbA1c 5.4%. Transthoracic echocardiogram (video 1): ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severely dilated LV. Mild LVH. Severe dysfunction (LVEF 22%) with global hypokinesia. Severe mitral insufficiency (MI) due to tenting. Asynchronous septal motion in relation to LBBB. Moderate tricuspid insufficiency (TI). Normofunctioning RV with moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH). Similar to previous echocardiographic findings.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient remained in hospital with good clinical evolution and excellent response to intravenous diuretic treatment, with notable clinical improvement and complete resolution of the congestive semiology, which made it possible to de-escalate the diuretic treatment to the usual oral dose at home. The pre-discharge NT-proBNP test was repeated, with notable improvement (600 pg/ml). The patient was already on outpatient neurohormonal treatment, which was not modified (previously, the introduction of ivabradine had been attempted in consultations, but was poorly tolerated and therefore discontinued). The patient was re-interviewed and reported episodes of increased dyspnoea during the last 4 months. It was decided to raise the case with the electrophysiology section of our department for the implantation of an ICD-CRT for primary prevention, which was accepted. The implantation took place without incident, achieving partial correction of the interventricular asynchrony. At the analytical level, it is worth noting ferropenia data, without associated anaemia. As this was a patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and symptoms (NYHA III-IV on admission), and given the data on improved exercise capacity, quality of life and functional capacity demonstrated by intravenous ferrotherapy in these patients, it was decided to administer iron carboxymaltose in a single dose of 500 mg. The patient was again educated in hygienic-dietary measures, was discharged and continued regular check-ups at the heart failure clinic. Eight months after discharge, he was clinically stable, asymptomatic, with baseline NYHA I/IV, with no new episodes of HF decompensation. A repeat echocardiogram showed an improvement in LVEF to 33%, with mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. The control analysis again showed an iron deficiency profile (ferritin 80 ug/l with TST 10%), with associated microcytic anaemia (Hb 11 g/l, with MCV 80 fl), which was not present on admission. In this case, our patient was clinically asymptomatic for his heart failure (NYHA I), but with associated anaemia, so it was decided to re-administer IV ferrotherapy (1000 mg of ferric carboxymaltose in a single dose, with a further administration of another 500 mg the following week in the day hospital). A faecal occult blood test was requested, which was positive, so the patient was referred to the gastrointestinal department for further evaluation with the relevant studies.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic decompensated heart failure, with severely reduced LVEF. Ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Chronic coronary syndrome with trivial coronary artery disease with multiple surgical and percutaneous revascularisations. Microcytic anaemia with iron deficiency profile pending digestive study. Procedures performed: first implantation of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator with cardiac resynchronisation therapy (ICD-CRT) in primary prevention and intravenous ferrotherapy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Genetic study of mitochondrial disease: detection of the most frequent mutations associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy type MELAS. The presence of the m.3243A>Gen mutation in the MT-TL1 gene has been detected. This variant has been found in heteroplasmy with 13% of the mutated G allele. Endomyocardial biopsy: numerous cox-negative fibres (> 50%). Although an increase in COX-negative cardiomyocytes attributed to age is reported, such a high percentage could be compatible with a disease of mitochondrial origin.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In the ED, with clinical suspicion of subacute onset heart failure of uncertain aetiology but with severe current situation with hypotension and peripheral hypoperfusion in addition to infectious analytical parameters and marked increase in markers of myocardial damage, infusion of volume expanders and initiation of oxygen therapy with Ventimask FiO2 31% and i.v. antibiotic therapy were decided. In the absence of response to initial emergency measures, the patient was admitted to the ICU in cardiogenic shock requiring support with vasoactive drugs (dobutamine and noradrenaline). On admission, an urgent echocardiogram was performed showing severe biventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 15%) with severe secondary mitral regurgitation and an apical ventricular thrombus, for which anticoagulation with enoxaparin was initiated and levosimendan perfusion was started. An emergency coronary angiography ruled out coronary artery disease and the patient was labelled cardiogenic shock in the context of probable acute myocarditis. During the first hours of ICU stay, the patient was sleepy but reactive and conscious, maintaining AMT 75 mmHg with a heart rate of around 80 bpm, but requiring vasoactive support. Some improvement in renal function with polyuria as well as from the respiratory point of view, requiring support only with nasal cannulas. Acceptable distal perfusion with good gasometric controls but with persistently high lactic acid. During the following 7-10 days the patient remained stationary, dependent on vasoactive drugs (VAD), with persistently elevated troponins and BNP levels (although slightly decreasing) and no improvement in cardiac ventricular function. During her admission to the ICU she was also assessed by angiology, who considered it necessary to perform a metatarsophalangeal amputation of the second-fourth MII phalanges in a few weeks, due to necrosis of the same, probably secondary to low cardiac output, high doses of VAD and ventricular thrombus embolism. Given the suspicion of myocarditis with a possible infectious aetiology due to the data of severe global dysfunction and elevated cardiac markers and acute phase reactants, serological tests were requested, with positive liver virus C, as well as IgG and IgM against cytomegalovirus and IgG against Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest of the tests were negative. Blood cultures were requested and were negative. CardioMRI with LGE was requested, but as the patient had a cochlear implant it was not possible to perform it. After a month of admission to the coronary unit, with slow but progressive improvement, remaining haemodynamically stable after withdrawal of vasoactive drugs, she was finally transferred to the hospital ward. A new echocardiogram was performed which showed an improvement in biventricular function (LVEF 41%), with no intraventricular thrombus visible. At the myocardial level, slight concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle was observed, which appeared hyperechogenic and with a reduced ventricular cavity size and data of advanced diastolic dysfunction with increased filling pressures and left atrial size, with no other valvular alterations other than the aforementioned mitral insufficiency. The data were suggestive of deposit or infiltrative disease, with an inflammatory/viral origin being less likely. Given these findings, an extensive aetiological study was continued, ruling out autoimmune diseases (negative autoantibody battery) and prothrombotic diseases (special coagulation study with heterozygosity for mutation in the gene for factor XII, methyltetrahydrofolate reductase and factor V Leiden). For the study of possible infiltrative disease, cardiac amyloidosis, both AA, AL and by transthyretin (TTR), was the first study target. Urine proteinogram and urine light chains were negative, and a rectal and subcutaneous fat biopsy with Congo red staining were negative. To rule out familial or senile transthyretin amyloidosis, a technetium-99 diphosphonate scan was performed, which did not identify abnormal TTR deposits. For the study of possible cardiac sarcoidosis, a whole-body PET-CT scan with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose was performed, which showed a diffuse, homogeneous circumferential uptake in the entire left ventricular myocardium, suggestive of deposit disease rather than inflammatory, but not compatible with the typical cardiac involvement of sarcoidosis, which is usually patchy. A blood test ruled out the presence of haemochromatosis (normal ferritin, transferrin and transferrin saturation index), as well as Wilson's disease and Fabry's disease. The patient was discharged in good functional class, after more than 2 months of hospitalisation, with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy of unaffiliated origin, and reviewed in consultation every three months. Initially she presented clinical and analytical improvement; however, from the eighth month after discharge, there was a progressive worsening with an increase in BNP and troponin, as well as a decrease in LVEF and the need for a new admission due to recurrence of the intraventricular thrombus. For this reason, treatment was started with apixaban 5 mg every 12 hours and diuretic and heart failure treatment was optimised. After discharge from hospital, the patient was referred to the outpatient clinic for family heart disease in order to clarify whether she might have a cardiomyopathy of this type. On closer examination, the patient's short stature (126 cm), the presence of sensorineural hearing loss and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) were noted, leading to the suspicion of mitochondrial MELAS disease. A genetic study was then requested to confirm this and indeed it showed an m.3243A>G mutation in the MT-TL1 gene, with heteroplasmy of 13% in peripheral blood, this being the variant most frequently associated with mitochondrial diseases, and in particular with MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes). In order to demonstrate a greater degree of heteroplasmy at the myocardial level and the possible association of myocarditis as a possible trigger for such a marked worsening of cardiac function, an endomyocardial biopsy was performed, which confirmed this suspicion. The patient has also been referred for neurological assessment and a matrilineal family study has been initiated.  DIAGNOSIS Possible acute myocarditis on underlying heart disease presenting as cardiogenic shock with favourable evolution. MELAS mitochondrial disease with m.3243A>G mutation in MT-TL1 gene. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to MELAS. WPW syndrome (left latera tract). Recurrent intraventricular thrombus with peripheral embolism (necrosis and amputation of lower phalanges). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Present illness Patient who was admitted to our centre on a scheduled basis to start outpatient cycles of levosimendan. The patient was referred from his reference centre (in the Community of Madrid) due to the overload of the system due to the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic. On admission, he denied an increase in basal oedema in the lower limbs and an increase in basal dyspnoea (which persisted on minimal exertion, although not at rest). However, he reported an increase in the use of a pillow in the last week to achieve a good night's rest.  Physical examination Temperature 36.7 oC; blood pressure 108/69 mmHg; heart rate 60 bpm; O2 saturation 93% with no oxygen intake. Weight on admission 72 kg. No signs of tachypnoea at rest. Neurological examination without alterations. Cardiac auscultation was rhythmic, with a low intensity systolic murmur in the aortic focus, non-radiated, and pulmonary auscultation with fine crackles in the right base. On abdominal examination, no organomegaly was palpable; hepatojugular reflux was positive. The lower limbs showed oedema in the distal third and no signs of deep vein thrombosis. Pulses were palpable and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram on admission: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm with ventricular stimulation by resynchroniser. No significant artefacts or signs of acute ischaemia. Laboratory tests on admission: haemoglobin 11.8 g/dl, MCV 91 fl, MCHC 33.5 g/dl, leukocytes 2400/μl (1900 segmented/ 300 lymphocytes/ 200 monocytes), platelets 130000/μl; glycaemia: 92 mg/dl, urea 94 mg/dl, creatinine 2.2 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate (MDRD) 26 ml/min/1.73, total bilirubin 1, GOT 39, GPT 26, sodium 131 mmol/l, potassium 4.8 mol/l, calcium 8 mg/dl, magnesium 2.3 mg/dl. Urgent chest X-ray: increased cardiothoracic index with discrete signs of vascular redistribution. Parenchymal infiltrate in the right lower lung lobe. There was minimal associated pleural effusion. The patient had a resynchronisation device, with normally positioned three-chamber electrodes. Microbiological study: rapid influenza A and B test: negative; antigenuria for pneumococcus: negative; antigenuria for Legionella (serogroup 1): negative; PCR for SARS-CoV2 coronavirus: positive. Control analytical study: haemoglobin 11.5 g/dl, MCV 93 fl, MCHC 32 g/dl, Leukocytes 4700/μl (3600 segmented/ 900 lymphocytes/ 150 monocytes), platelets 237000/μl; glycaemia: 109 mg/dl, urea 67 mg/dl, creatinine 1.7 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate (MDRD) 37 ml/min/1.73, total bilirubin 1.3, GOT 29, GPT 25, sodium 136 mmol/l, potassium 4.2 mol/l, calcium 8.3 mg/dl, magnesium 1.8 mg/dl. Cardiac biomarkers: ultrasensitive troponin I 78 μg/l (reference limit < 20 μg/l) CPK 121 IU, ProBNP 4325 pg/ml. Anaemia profile: iron 147 μg/dl (ref < 175), ferritin 94 μg/ml, transferrin 187 mg/dl, IST 7%, folic acid > 24 ng/ml. Chest X-ray prior to discharge: the right pulmonary infiltrate practically disappeared.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient had been seen in outpatient cardiology consultations at our centre the previous week for re-evaluation of the case, in which he reported an absence of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. However, he did describe the symptoms described previously, compatible with an increase in his usual orthopnoea. A blood test drawn by protocol prior to the first cycle with levosimendan showed lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia with an increase in acute phase reactants. The patient was re-evaluated in a targeted manner, on this occasion referring to the existence of a diarrhoeal syndrome with stools without pathological products in the last 4 days, which he had not previously described. His temperature had not been taken, although he did not describe fever or chills. She did report intense asthenia, which she had attributed to her cardiac pathology. A chest X-ray was requested, which revealed the presence of a right pneumonic infiltrate. In this context, the COVID-19 suspicion protocol was activated and the patient was transferred to an isolation area, where microbiological samples were taken. Treatment was started with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, given the high suspicion in a patient at risk with pulmonary infiltrate, and diuretic treatment was reinforced by adding intravenous furosemide 80 mg daily to his usual treatment. During admission, serial electrocardiographic and analytical determinations were performed. At the last check-up after finishing the hydroxychloroquine regimen, an iron profile study was performed and ferropenia was detected, so it was proposed to start treatment with 1 gram of hierrocarboxymaltose prior to discharge. Administration was carried out without incident. The patient had a favourable clinical evolution, remaining afebrile and with minimal oxygen intake throughout admission. He showed a weight reduction of 5.5 kg. He completed the treatment regimen with hydroxychloroquine and, after consultation with the patient, it was decided to administer the first course of levosimendan, with good haemodynamic tolerance and no notable complications. Three weeks after discharge, the patient received the second cycle of levosimendan with excellent tolerance. When contacted by telephone, the patient reported symptomatic improvement with a reduction in the number of pillows and a decrease in dyspnoea to NYHA functional class II. The asthenia had disappeared.  DIAGNOSIS Advanced chronic heart failure with severely depressed ejection fraction. Congenitally corrected transposition of great vessels. Right lower pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Re-exacerbated chronic kidney disease. Iron deficiency treated with intravenous administration of iron-carboxymaltose. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O
We present the case of a 68-year-old man with a history of mitro-aortic valve disease who presented with new onset left heart failure, which highlights the importance of finding its cause for its aetiological treatment.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): arterial hypertension (AHT) of more than 10 years of evolution in treatment with irbesartan with good control. LD of 8 years of evolution. No diabetes mellitus (DM). Cardiological history: aortic valve disease of unknown origin (no reports available), which required valve surgery with implantation of a biological aortic prosthesis at the age of 33 (1979), replacement with a BJORK mechanical aortic prosthesis (monodisc no 21) at the age of 43 (1989). And new cardiac surgery for implantation of mechanical mitral prosthesis Omnicarbon No 27 at the age of 55 (2001), due to mitral insufficiency of degenerative origin. Permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) since the age of 53 (cardioversion in 2002, 2003, 2005 not effective). Severe pulmonary hypertension prior to mitral valve surgery. Preserved LVEF. Other medical history: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Surgical interventions: no other surgical antecedents of interest. Usual treatment: bromazepam 1.5 mg/24 hours, omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours, irbesartan 150 mg/24 hours, bisoprolol 5 mg/12 hours, furosemide 40 mg/24 hours, digoxin 1.25 mg/24 hours, tadalafil 40 mg/24 hours, paracetamol 1 g/8 hours if needed, sintrom according to guideline. Baseline: independent for basic activities of daily living. Dyspnoea on moderate exertion. Orthopnoea on 2 pillows. No cognitive impairment.  Present illness A 68-year-old man with increased dyspnoea of moderate to minimal exertion for 10-12 days. No chest pain. Orthopnoea on 3 pillows. Reduced diuresis. Increased nocturnal cough without expectoration. Afebrile. Increase in the perimeter of the lower limbs (MMII). Treated with azithromycin and Flutox without improvement. Generalised myalgias.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 184/85 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 77 bpm, temperature 36 oC, SatO2 91%. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic, metallic click in aortic focus, systolic murmur in left parasternal border. Pulmonary auscultation: bilateral crackles with abolition of vesicular murmur in the left hemithorax. Abdomen: RHA+, globular, tympanised, scarcely depressible, not painful on deep palpation. MMII: malleolar oedema with bilateral fovea, chronic venous insufficiency with trophic disorders in the skin.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Chest X-ray: left pleural effusion, image with increased density in the posterior lobe of the right hemithorax, left laminar atelectasis, rounded laminar atelectasis. Electrocardiogram (ECG): AF with controlled RV. Cornell LVH. Repolarisation alterations in V5, V6, I, aVL, II in digitised patient. CBC: leukocytes 11,300 thousands/mcl, sodium 68.4%, Hb 12.6 g/dl Hto 39.2%, platelets 179,000 thousands/mcl, urea 81 mg/dl, Cr 1.08 mg/dl, GOT 32 Ul/l, GPT 29 Ul/l, CPK 29, Na 135 mEq/l, K 4.5 mEq/l. Echocardiogram: severely dilated right atrium. Severely dilated right ventricle. Severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT). RVEF at the limit. Functional tricuspid insufficiency due to dilatation of the annulus and stretching of the chordae tendineae, severe. Slightly dilated left atrium. Anomalous septal motion, paradoxical. Slightly depressed LVEF 45%. Mitral and aortic metallic prosthesis of monodisc appearance and preserved mobility. Chest CT: water retention in the right hemithorax (evanescent tumour), a subacute/chronic aortic dissection, Standford type A or type I according to the Bakey classification, without involvement of the coronary arteries. Abdomen-pelvis CT scan: the dissection extended to the right external iliac artery and reached the right common femoral artery. The true lumen irrigated the celiac trunk, superior and inferior mesenteric artery and both renal arteries. The thoracic portion of the descending aorta had a diameter of 33.4 mm and 26 mm at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus. The false lumen measured 11.7 mm. There was also a mild right and moderate left pleural effusion of posterobasal and subpulmonary location and a loculated effusion in the right major fissure (evanescent tumour with a smooth and regular edge) measuring 65 x 35 mm.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to hospital for further investigation and treatment. After an initial assessment, the diagnosis was compatible with right and left heart failure, the latter being a new onset, for which diuretic treatment was prescribed. There was clinical improvement and the increase in density found in the X-ray taken during the stay in the emergency department was partially reduced, although it did not disappear. A chest CT scan was requested to assess the image in the right hemithorax, which showed water retention at that level (evanescent tumour) and detected a subacute/chronic aortic dissection of Standford type A or type I according to the Bakey classification, without involvement of the coronary arteries. Subsequent studies showed its extension to the right external iliac artery until it reached the right common femoral artery. The true lumen irrigated the celiac trunk, superior and inferior mesenteric artery and both renal arteries. The patient reported no chest pain at any time. Given the findings, sintrom was suspended and i.v. sodium heparin was started. The case was discussed with the cardiac surgery service of the referral hospital and it was decided to transfer the patient for surgery. The patient underwent aortic surgery, implanting a FlowWeave Bioseal 32 mm supracoronary vascular prosthesis, "transforming" the Stanford type A dissection into a type B, together with tricuspid Vega annuloplasty.  DIAGNOSIS Subacute Stanford type A aortic dissection candidate for cardiac surgery. Normofunctioning mitral and aortic prosthesis. Mildly affected LVEF with borderline RVEF. Severe PHT. Permanent AF. AHT.

The patient was a 52-year-old man who came to the emergency department for a syncopal episode while he was watching his son's football match. Due to the infrequent aetiopathogenesis of the condition and treatment, we consider it interesting to report it.  HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known drug allergies. Active smoking (3-4 cigars/day). Chronic alcoholism. No other cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). No surgical history. In treatment with disulfiram, with no other chronic medications.  Present illness A 52-year-old man came to the emergency department for a syncopal episode with a fall to the ground while watching a football match. The episode was preceded by facial flushing, sweating, general malaise and pallor. He had no chest pain, dyspnoea or palpitations. Eyewitnesses denied convulsive movements. Emergency medical services were contacted and he was treated on the spot.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) (on arrival at the emergency department) 90/50 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 70 bpm. Oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Respiratory rate 16 rpm. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. No obvious neurological focality. Afebrile. Sweating. Jugular venous pressure normal. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no extra sounds. No oedema in the lower extremities, no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: Blood count: normal. Biochemistry: basal glucose 94 mg/dl; creatinine 0.9 mg/dl; normal ions and transaminases; total cholesterol 152 mg/dl; LDL-C 87 mg/dl. Hyperlactacidemia without acidosis, transient. Maximal serial myocardial necrosis markers: troponin T us 657 ng/l (normal < 13 ng/l). Baseline coagulation: INR 1.13; PT 87%; aPTT ratio 1.15.  Electrocardiogram: On arrival of the emergency medical team (image 1): sinus tachycardia at 110 bpm. Narrow QRS, axis at -15o. Embryonic R wave with flat T wave in DIII and aVF. J-point descent of 1 mm in V1-V2. Discrete elevation (maximum 1 mm in V5) of the ST segment from V3 to V6. At discharge: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm, with high R wave in V2 and negative T waves in inferior face. Echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) of normal size and thickness, preserved systolic function (EF 60%) with mild inferior hypokinesia. Left atrium (LA) and right chambers normal. No significant valvular abnormalities. No pulmonary hypertension. Aortic root of normal size. No pericardial effusion. Interconsultation with the psychosomatic department: treatment for addiction is reinforced. Start of clomethiazole. Coronary angiography: images of intracoronary thrombus (without complicated plaque) in proximal-medial DC. After 1 week of treatment with i.v. sodium heparin, the thrombus resolved. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed an image suggestive of plaque erosion in the proximal-medial right coronary artery (RCA), which was not treated (medical treatment). The rest of the coronary arteries showed no significant lesions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival of the emergency medical team, frank arterial hypotension was observed (70/40 mmHg) and an ECG was performed showing ST segment underleveling from V3 to V6, which subsequently evolved to discrete ST segment supralowing in these leads, for which reason he was transferred to the emergency department of our centre. On arrival, the ECG normalised. Despite initially denying it, he admitted alcohol intake minutes before the syncopal episode (currently under treatment with disulfiram). After documenting a significant increase in ultrasensitive troponin T in serial determinations, it was decided to admit him to the cardiology ward for study and treatment with an initial diagnosis of high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). During his stay on the ward he remained stable and asymptomatic. The echocardiogram showed preserved LV systolic function with slight inferior hypokinesia. Early coronary angiography revealed the presence of a thrombus in the proximal and middle DC, secondary to the acetaldehyde reaction due to alcohol-disulfiram interaction, and the decision was made to maintain double antiplatelet therapy and initiate anticoagulation with i.v. sodium heparin for 1 week.  After a week of anticoagulation, coronary angiography was repeated, showing the disappearance of the thrombus in the DC, although OCT detected plaque erosion in this location, which was not considered necessary to revascularise. The need to maintain alcohol abstinence and avoid alcohol intake under treatment with disulfiram, as well as smoking cessation, is insisted upon. Treatment at discharge with double antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and ticagrelor, PPI (omeprazole), and treatment by the psychiatrist, maintaining disulfiram with strict control and clomethiazole.  DIAGNOSIS Acute non-Q myocardial infarction of inferior location, secondary to acetaldehyde reaction due to alcohol-disulfiram interaction with intracoronary thrombus formation in proximal and middle DC, resolved after double antiplatelet therapy and 1 week of parenteral anticoagulation. Preserved LV systolic function with inferior hypokinesia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of a 59-year-old male patient who was referred to our hospital from the cardiology outpatient department after reviewing the images of a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) performed on an outpatient basis and requested due to a pathological electrocardiogram (ECG).  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known allergic reactions to drugs. Toxic habits: smoker of 1 pack a day (cumulative exposure of 40 packs/year). Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): hypercholesterolemia. No family history of early ischaemic heart disease. Surgical history: laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in 2011. Usual treatment: omeprazole 20 mg/day, atorvastatin 20 mg/day.  Current disease A 59-year-old male patient came to the cardiology outpatient clinic referred from primary care for evaluation after a casual finding of a pathological electrocardiographic tracing in a health check-up at his company. The patient brought to the consultation an ECG showing Q waves in the inferior aspect and an echocardiographic study performed in a private clinic describing alterations of contractility in the inferior aspect at mid-basal level with a moderately depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. In view of these findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested, which showed chronic necrosis of 4 segments of the territory belonging to the right coronary artery and a pseudoaneurysm in the inferior face of the middle segment, so it was decided to admit the patient to hospital to complete the study and present the case at the medical-surgical session. In the anamnesis, the patient denied any previous episodes of chest pain. Nor did he report cardinal symptoms of heart failure or suggestive of systemic embolism. NYHA functional class I.  Physical examination Good general condition, normohydrated, normal colour. Eupneic at rest without use of accessory muscles. Conscious, oriented and cooperative, without apparent neurological focality. Blood pressure (BP) 136/67 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 72 bpm, oxygen saturation (SatO2) 99% (ambient air). Cardiac auscultation: regular sounds, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no rales. No oedema in the lower limbs. Radial and femoral pulses present.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS The following complementary tests were performed on an outpatient basis: ECG: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, PR 160 ms, narrow QRS with axis at +30°, Q wave in II, III and aVF, flattened T wave V4-V6. CMR: normal left ventricular volumes with moderately depressed systolic function (LVEF 37%). Hypokinesia of inferoseptal, inferior and inferolateral basal segments. Severe dyskinesia and thinning (< 2 mm) located in the lower middle segment, with rupture of the wall and image of pseudoaneurysm contained by the pericardium (neck 7 mm; width 28 mm; depth 18 mm). Partial thrombosis is observed lining its inner wall. Absence of myocardial oedema. Normal right ventricular volumes, with normal systolic function (RVEF 63%). Normal sized atria. Normal sized great vessels. First-pass hypoperfusion at rest in the dysfunctioning segments. Intravenous gadolinium (meglumine gadoterate 0.15 mmol/kg) is administered. Late gadolinium enhancement suggestive of transmural necrosis in mid inferior segment and subendocardial necrosis in inferoseptal, inferior and inferolateral basal segments. In summary: chronic necrosis of 4 segments of the RCA, pseudoaneurysm in inferior inferior mid-segment and moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function.  After admission, the study was completed with the following examinations: Chest X-ray: mediastinal silhouette of normal size. No areas of alveolar consolidation or pleural effusion were observed. Laboratory tests: glucose 81 mg/dl, creatinine 0.85 mg/dl, urea 39 mg/dl, sodium 138 mmol/l, potassium 4 mmol/l, total cholesterol 188 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 113 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 56 mg/dl, triglycerides 99 mg/dl, leucocytes 6.05 x 109/l, haemoglobin 14.6 g/dl, platelets 226 x 109/l, glycated haemoglobin 5.4%, ultrasensitive troponin T 26 pg/ml (normal < 14 pg/ml), NT-proBNP 1.780 pg/ml. Transthoracic echocardiography: non-dilated left ventricle, with slight septal hypertrophy and akinesia of the basal and mid inferior and inferoseptal wall (thinned and echorefringent wall suggestive of chronic necrosis), with presence of a defect in the mid segment inferior wall (wall rupture) and image of saccular pseudoaneurysm, narrow neck (ostium 7-8 mm), visible in parasternal short axis and mainly in apical planes of 2C and 3C. Moderately depressed LV global systolic function (biplane Simpson LVEF 40%). Severely dilated left atrium. Mitral valve with good opening and minimal valve regurgitation. Aortic valve with normal transvalvular gradients, without valvular regurgitation. Right ventricle not dilated, with good contractility. Absence of pericardial effusion.  Diagnostic coronary catheterisation (videos 1 and 2): left main coronary artery (LMCA) without lesions. Long anterior descending artery (ADA), good calibre, with severe lesion (80%) in proximal segment, very calcified and significant lesion (60%) in middle segment (with feasible percutaneous revascularisation). Circumflex artery (ACx) non-dominant, with non-significant wall irregularities. Dominant right coronary artery (RCA), with long ostial chronic total occlusion, with coin stack image in proximal cap, and distal vessel of good calibre and visible development by epicardial and septal heterocoronary circulation (Rentrop 3) with poor profile for percutaneous revascularisation. Conclusions: two-vessel coronary artery disease with severe lesion in proximal and significant medial LAD and chronic total occlusion of ostial RCA. Transthoracic echocardiography (postoperative control): left ventricle with akinesia of the inferior wall and basal and medial inferoseptal wall, with thinned and echorefringent wall, with no pseudoaneurysmal cavity observed in the inferior face. Moderately reduced global systolic function of the left ventricle. Rest of the study unchanged with respect to previous. Absence of pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During admission, the preoperative study was completed with the complementary tests described above. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the findings described in the CMR, while coronary catheterisation showed two-vessel coronary artery disease consisting of a severe lesion in the proximal LAD and significant mid LAD, and a chronic ostial occlusion of the RCA. During surgery, a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm was visualised on the inferior aspect of approximately 3 cm in diameter with thickened and calcified walls, with thrombotic content inside and an ostium communicating with the left ventricle of approximately 1 cm2. A posterior descending artery of small calibre and located in the scar territory of the pseudoaneurysm was also visualised and was therefore ruled out as a tributary vessel for aortocoronary bypass. Finally, resection of the aneurysmal area and reconstruction of the lower wall with an autologous pericardial patch were performed. Subsequently, a double aortocoronary bypass was performed to the middle ADA with the left mammary artery and to the first diagonal with the saphenous artery, both of them end-to-side. The patient's stay in the resuscitation unit was uneventful with early extubation and discharge to the hospital ward 48 hours after surgery. A control transthoracic echocardiography was performed, which did not show the pseudoaneurysmal cavity and ruled out early postoperative complications. Postoperative evolution was satisfactory with clinical and haemodynamic stability, and he was discharged from hospital for outpatient follow-up in cardiology and cardiac surgery outpatient clinics.  DIAGNOSIS Silent myocardial infarction complicated by left inferior ventricular pseudoaneurysm. 2-vessel coronary artery disease (proximal and middle LAD and ostial LAD). Moderate left ventricular dysfunction. Aneurysm resection surgery and coronary revascularisation of LAD. Hypercholesterolemia. Smoking. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient was a 72-year-old white man with a history of apparent health and no evidence of previous valvular heart disease who 2 months prior to admission began to present with fever and weakness, with general malaise and dyspnoea on exertion. The fever was never higher than 39oC and usually appeared in the afternoons. Initially it subsided quickly with the usual antipyretic measures, but became more persistent until it appeared for 10 to 12 hours a day. In his health care area it was interpreted as a fever of unknown origin until leukocytosis and accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation were observed. Without specifying the cause, treatment with penicillin was started and on the fifth day amikacin was added as the desired improvement was not achieved. He was then referred to our centre for an echocardiogram and on physical examination we found a III/VI sitolic murmur at the tip radiating towards the axilla with a small diastolic murmur, hepatosplenomegaly and the presence of crepitant rales in both lung bases. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed the presence of a mass on the posterior mitral leaflet compatible with endocardial vegetation. We then decided to admit the patient with the diagnostic impression of IE, took samples for blood cultures and started treatment with vancomycin and gentamicin, considering the possibility of Staphylococcus aureus as the causative agent, but the fever persisted, the patient's clinical condition worsened and we received 8 negative blood cultures. We took samples to use special culture media and found the presence of Candida albicans, so we started treatment with amphotericin B, but, although the fever decreased, the haemodynamic status did not improve and we decided to perform surgery. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement without complications, and a mechanical bidisc prosthesis was used. The pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. The patient completed his hospital course of amphotericin B and was discharged on oral ketoconazole, in addition to digitalis, diuretics and anticoagulants. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O

Emergency laboratory tests: glucose: 242 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.53 mg/dl. Urea 19 mg/dl. GPT 29 U/l. Bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl. Sodium 137 mEq/l. Potassium 4.4 mEq/litre. Calcium 8.6 mg/dl. Albumin 3.1 g/dl. CK 399 U/l. LDH 250 U/l. CRP 46.5 mg/l. PCT 0,36 ng/ml. Haemoglobin 9.7 g/dl. Haematocrit 31.0%. Platelets 211 *10^3/μl. Leucocytes: 7.9 *10^3/μl. Neutrophils 72.7%. Neutrophils 5.7 *10^3/μl. Lymphocytes 17.3%. Lymphocytes 1.4 *10^3/μl. Prothrombin time 49%. INR1.7. APTT 53 sg. Fibrinogen 503 mg/dl. Chest X-ray in the ED: no evidence of HF. ECG on the ward: sinus rhythm with 2:1 atrioventricular block, QRS axis at 60o. ST elevation in inferior face (II,III, and aVF) and ST descent in I-aVL. Regulated transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle with mild LVH with ejection fraction (LVEF) 50%. Hypokinesia of the inferior, posterior and basal face of the posterior septum, of the apical segment of the anterior septum, apical of the anterior face and strict apex. Thickened and sclerosed mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation, unclear mechanism: no clear tenting or posterior leaflet stiffness. Mechanical aortic prosthesis with excrescent and mobile images in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) compatible with endocardial grafts. No aortic regurgitation. Maximum transprosthetic gradient of 35 mmHg. Right ventricle slightly dilated, hypokinetic, with mild global dysfunction. Severe tricuspid insufficiency (TI). Vd-Ad gradient of 45 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Diagnosis: images compatible with aortic endocarditis. Inferior and apical akinesia. Severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Catheterisation: left dominance. Severe two-vessel coronary artery disease: mid-distal anterior descending (AD) occlusion, subocclusive lesion in distal circumflex (Cx), posterior descending occlusion. Balloon aspiration and angioplasty was performed in the LAD and distal Cx with good results, except for the posterior descending artery, which remained occluded. Transesophageal echocardiogram: hypermobile endocardial graft protruding into LVOT on aortic prosthesis with periaortic thickening suggestive of abscess. In addition, a mobile image in the right atrium in continuity with the mitral abscess and very close to the tricuspid septal leaflet with severe TR. The mitral valve was explored and no endocardial warts were seen on the mitral valve, but there was moderate to severe mitral insufficiency in relation to tenting and central coaptation deficit. The overall LVEF is at the low limit of normal with hypocytosis of the inferior, posterior and posterior septum.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After admission to the Infectious Diseases department, fever of 38.5oC and shivering persisted throughout the weekend. The blood cultures taken in the emergency department had been lost, so new blood cultures (HC) were taken on Saturday and antibiotic therapy was upgraded to vancomycin-levofloxacin as empirical treatment for fever without a clear focus. On Sunday, fever persisted, with a slight worsening of the general condition. On Monday there was an evident clinical worsening with hypotension despite fluid therapy, bradycardia and increased dyspnoea. The laboratory was notified of S. epidermidis growth in 4 of 4 bottles. With these data, the cardiology department was contacted again for a new echocardiogram and clinical assessment. An ECG was performed showing 2nd degree 2:1 atrioventricular block (AVB) together with ST elevation in inferior leads with ST descent on the lateral side. On further questioning, the patient reported some intermittent precordial discomfort associated with dyspnoea since that morning. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed endocarditis over the aortic prosthesis and alterations in segmental contractility. In view of the clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings, emergent catheterisation was performed. After revascularisation, clinical worsening persisted with dyspnoea and haemodynamic instability (hypotension) and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and stabilisation. In view of progressive dyspnoea and the impossibility of tolerating TEE, orotracheal intubation and connection to invasive mechanical ventilation were performed, as well as the start of perfusion of noradrenaline and dobutamine at low doses, despite which instability persisted with significant bradycardia, for which reason a transient transjugular pacemaker was implanted. With all the data and with the diagnosis of infective endocarditis on prosthetic aortic valve complicated with mitroaortic abscess, extension to tricuspid valve, AVB, septic coronary embolisms and cardiogenic/septic shock, emergency cardiac surgery was decided where aortic valve replacement with biological prosthesis, tricuspid valve replacement with biological prosthesis and mitral ring placement were performed. After 66 days in the ICU and multiple complications including acute renal failure requiring continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration, acute respiratory failure, pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation due to gram-negative bacillus, acute tracheobronchitis due to A. fumigatus, persistent complete AVB, C. parapsilopsis bacteraemia associated with central venous catheter, ischaemic hepatitis, paralytic ileus, multifactorial encephalopathy with a significant component of hypoxia and significant truncal-diencephalic damage with persistent coma, and finally death.  DIAGNOSIS Early endocarditis on mechanical prosthetic aortic valve due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Mitroaortic junction abscess with extension to tricuspid valve. Severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Atrioventricular block 2:1. Acute myocardial infarction with lower ST elevation. Septic coronary embolisms in the dominant circumflex and anterior descending coronary artery. Thromboaspiration and balloon angioplasty over LAD and Cx. Mixed cardiogenic/septic shock. Emergent surgery for aortic, tricuspid and mitral ring valve replacement. Death. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

ECG at discharge (image 5): AF with RV at 60 bpm. HR-CDBHR similar to the admission ECG.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After decompensation of HF refractory to oral and intravenous diuretics, the patient was admitted to cardiology with high-dose intravenous loop diuretics in combination with oral thiazide. The ECG performed on admission showed atrial fibrillation at about 60 bpm, normal axis, HRBBB with secondary repolarisation alterations, and chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion, predominantly on the left, with evidence of vascular redistribution, aortic calcification and spondyloarthrosis. Laboratory tests on admission showed worsening renal function in the context. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a non-dilated left ventricle with moderate concentric hypertrophy, preserved ejection fraction with impaired relaxation, no significant valvular heart disease, normal estimated PSAP, dilated inferior vena cava (IVC). Good diuretic response and marked improvement in decongestion. On the fifth day of admission, the patient had an episode of dizziness, bradycardia and BP of 85/60 mmHg. The nurse notified the doctor on duty, who found that the patient was conscious, although drowsy and sleepy, and reactive to verbal stimuli. On physical examination he was cold, bradycardic, rhythmic, with no murmurs and no signs of congestion at the time. AC: bradycardic, rhythmic, no murmurs. ECG: atrial fibrillation with complete atrioventricular block (AVB) with ventricular escape, with a different morphology to the baseline, at about 30 bpm (image 4). Urgent laboratory tests were requested to rule out ionic alterations, but the ions were in range and his renal function was stable with no worsening with respect to previous years. Blood pressure improved after infusion of 1000 cc of physiological saline. The patient was transferred to the coronary unit for monitoring. After ruling out ionic aetiology, in view of a possible pharmacological trigger, it was decided to suspend doses of beta-blocker (nebivolol 2.5 mg) and eye drops (brimonidine/timolol). However, a comparison of the medication administered showed that two tablets of carbidopa/levodopa 25/250 mg (plus formulation) were accidentally administered every eight hours, instead of the usual dose of carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg. After discontinuation of all three drugs, without the need for implantation of pacing devices, the patient showed improvement of atrioventricular conduction disturbance, recovering 1:1 conduction in less than 24 hours. Subsequently, the patient remained in AF with controlled VR and after 48 hours (in the presence of elevated HR) nebivolol could be reintroduced at its previous doses without incident. The patient is discharged with improved renal function and congestive data in AF with controlled VR under treatment with a well-tolerated beta-blocker.  DIAGNOSIS Complete AVB due to accidental carbidopa/levodopa overdose. Decompensated heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Permanent atrial fibrillation CHAD2DS2-VASc 4. Exacerbation of stage 3a chronic kidney disease. Stiff-kinetic syndrome on treatment with carbidopa/levodopa. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History A 63-year-old man, operated in 1986 for ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm and severe aortic insufficiency secondary to bicuspid aortic valve. He underwent Bentall-Bono surgery with implantation of a bicuspid aortic valve prosthesis Bono surgery was performed with implantation of a mechanical prosthesis. As a complication, he presented with extensive anteroseptal infarction after the patient was taken off cardiopulmonary bypass, which led to severe systolic dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. The patient has remained asymptomatic ever since. Treatment: lisinopril 5 mg/24 hours, acenocoumarol, atorvastatin 20 mg/24 hours, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 hours, spironolactone 25 mg/24 hours.  Present illness The patient came for consultation because for the last 6 months he has presented with moderate exertional dyspnoea not previously present. He does not report chest pain or increased oedema in the lower limbs or any other symptoms compatible with heart failure. He also reported the appearance of a lump in the upper third of the sternum, without skin opening, fever or redness in the area.  Physical examination Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, aortic prosthetic sounds. Systolic murmur II/VI in mitral focus. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. No crackles. Lump at the level of the upper third of the sternotomy next to the sternal notch, on the right edge of the sternum. No redness or increase in temperature. No clear signs of infection. Liquid content to the touch. The presence of thrill on auscultation and to the touch is striking. Not painful.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm. Left bundle branch block with secondary repolarisation alterations. Echocardiogram: dilated left ventricle (LV) with severely depressed LVEF. Extensive anterior, anteroseptal and septal akinesia. Moderate functional mitral insufficiency (MI). Aortic prosthesis with no evidence of dysfunction. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size and function. No tricuspid insufficiency (TI) that would allow estimation of pulmonary systolic pressure. Transesophageal echocardiogram focused on assessing mitral insufficiency: moderate functional mitral insufficiency (MI) (effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) 2D 0.12 cm2, area of vena contracta 3D 0.15 cm2). Anatomy suitable for mitral clip implantation. Aortic valved tube with no evidence of dysfunction. Given the findings of the physical examination in relation to the bultoma, it was decided to request a CT scan of the aorta to rule out vascular complications at this level. The CT scan showed a skin lesion in the anterior mediastinal region, in contact with the ascending thoracic aorta through a bone defect in the sternal manubrium. However, there is no contrast in its interior so it should not have flow in the arterial phase. Chronic dissections are seen in the intervened ascending aorta, one of them with a connection to the cutaneous lesion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the presence of pseudoaneurysm contained in the valved tube, it was decided to perform repair surgery. Prior to surgery, a transeophageal echocardiogram was performed to confirm the severity of the MR, coronary artery catheterisation was also performed, which ruled out the presence of lesions, and the presence of double lumen in the valved tube was confirmed by aortography. It was jointly decided that as the patient was going to undergo cardiac surgery, he would benefit from mitral valvuloplasty with a ring. Surgery was performed with hypothermic arrest at 18o given the high risk of rupture of the pseudoaneurysm when performing the sternotomy. The pseudoaneurysm was confirmed with an entry port at the anastomosis of the valved tube with the aortic root. It is completely removed and replaced with a biological valved tube. Ring annuloplasty is also performed. Postoperative period was uneventful. One year later, a control echocardiogram showed: aortic prosthesis with no evidence of dysfunction, mitral annuloplasty with significant MR that was difficult to quantify, dilated LV with severely depressed LVEF (30%) and akinesia of the anterior, anteroseptal and septal faces. Transesophageal echocardiography was then requested to quantify the MR, which showed: mitral annuloplasty with severe functional MR (ORE 2D 0.34 cm2). Dehiscence of the mitral annulus between 7 and 9 o'clock in surgical position, leaving a communication between the upper and lower part of the annulus of 1.68 cm2. Biological aortic prosthesis and aortic tube with no evidence of dysfunction. Rest of the study superimposable to previous ones. Given that the patient was asymptomatic for the moment, it was decided to maintain a wait-and-see attitude with regard to mitral insufficiency. In March 2020, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pneumonia. During his admission, the patient developed respiratory distress syndrome and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. After 12 days in the ICU, the patient evolved correctly and was extubated and transferred to the ward, where he is currently progressing favourably.  DIAGNOSIS Bicuspid aortic valve.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 26-year-old woman with no relevant past history except for well-controlled extrinsic asthma, who came to the emergency department for a febrile syndrome of 2 weeks' duration accompanied by general malaise, generalised arthromyalgia, headache and epigastralgia. He reported having started with this clinical condition after returning from a trip to Southeast Asia. One week before the consultation, he started with diarrhoea without pathological products. In addition, about 72 hours before admission, he presented continuous chest pain with pleuropericardial characteristics, which persisted at the time of assessment. He reported having been correctly vaccinated for the trip and had followed the health recommendations. On arrival he presented with a low-grade fever (temperature 37.5oC). Skin pallor and general state of health, with rhythmic tachycardia at 140 beats per minute and blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. Adequate basal saturation. No heart murmurs, pulmonary crackles or oedema in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Among the complementary tests performed in the initial assessment, we highlight the following: Electrocardiogram: sinus tachycardia at 122 bpm with complete right bundle branch block (unknown) and ST elevation in the antero-septal aspect. Portable chest X-ray: normal CTI. Discrete vascular redistribution, absence of pleural effusion or infiltrates. Urgent laboratory tests (with normal values from the reference laboratory): pH 7.42 (7.35-7.45), creatinine 0.55 mg/dl (0.5-0.9), potassium 4.20 mmol/l (3.5-5.0), troponin I 30.52 μg/l (0.0 - 0.06), CK 871 IU/l. C-reactive protein 119.90 mg/l (0.1-10.0), NT-proBNP 13114 pg/ml (10-125). Lactate 2.2 mmol/l. Leukocytes 14.26 x10E3/μl (4.0-11.5) with neutrophils 10.27 x10E3/μl. Haemolobin 12.8 g/dl. INR 1.02. Urgent transthoracic echocardiogram: moderately hypertrophic left ventricle with oedematous appearance and moderately depressed systolic function (subjective LVEF 35-40%). Right ventricle normal in size and function. Mildly moderate mitral regurgitation. Minimal tricuspid insufficiency. No pericardial effusion, normal inferior vena cava. During admission, the following tests were performed: Serology: no relevant findings. Blood cultures: negative. Urine cultures: negative. Pharyngeal smear and tracheal exudate: negative. ASLO: negative. Endomyocardial biopsy: endomyocardial biopsy (3 fragments) with interstitial lymphohistiocytic infiltrates with myofibrillar damage, compatible with myocarditis. ECG at discharge: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm. Wide QRS (150 ms) with morphology of complete right bundle branch block (RBBB). Generalised low voltage. Echocardiography at discharge: left ventricle of normal dimensions, with moderate systolic dysfunction and global hypokinesia, although more pronounced at septal level. Global longitudinal Strain 12.8%. Normal right ventricle. Minimal mitral insufficiency. No tricuspid insufficiency. No pericardial effusion. Normal IVC. Cardiac MRI: findings compatible with myocarditis. Slightly reduced global contractility (LVEF 47%). Thinning, hypokinesia and increased signal in STIR sequences and basal anteroseptal midventricular enhancement. Late enhancement of the lateral wall of the right ventricle. Mild pericardial effusion. Renal and hepatic function and biomarkers of myocardial damage at discharge: creatinine 1.3 mg/dl. Total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dl. GGT 51 U/l. Maximum troponin I 102 μg/l. NT-proBNP maximum of 110000 pg/ml, at discharge 4259 pg/ml.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After being assessed by the cardiology team, it was decided to transfer her to the acute cardiac care unit for close monitoring, where she presented poor initial evolution with criteria of cardiogenic shock, both clinical and analytical, so inotropic and vasoactive support treatment was started. An endomyocardial biopsy was performed, confirming the diagnosis of lymphocytic myocarditis, and it was decided to administer intravenous corticosteroids (three doses of methylprednisolone). In the first hours of admission, the patient began with slow ventricular tachycardia with haemodynamic instability and incessant behaviour, despite treatment with intravenous antiarrhythmics and several attempts at electrical cardioversion. It was decided by consensus with the shock team to implant an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), with subsequent peripheral veno-arterial ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) cannulation. The patient also required renal replacement therapy in the first days of admission due to acute renal failure.  After 5 days of mechanical circulatory support and in view of the favourable evolution, ECMO and IABP were gradually withdrawn. The patient was transferred to the cardiology ward to continue her evolution and start the titration of neurohormonal medication for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Control echocardiography at discharge showed improvement in ventricular function with moderate dysfunction and magnetic resonance imaging showed findings compatible with myocarditis. The patient was discharged after three weeks of admission with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis (histopathological diagnosis), but none of the serologies, multiple cultures or other samples were able to identify a specific aetiological agent. At the office evaluation more than one year later, the patient had recovered ventricular function and was in NYHA functional class I. She was maintained on neurohormonal treatment. Neurohormonal treatment for systolic dysfunction has been maintained.  DIAGNOSIS Refractory cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS 1, SCAI E) with need for mechanical circulatory support (ECMO + IABP). Fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis. Heart failure with depressed ejection fraction, recovered after one year of evolution with neurohormonal treatment. CF I NYHA. Acute renal failure (Cardiorenal syndrome type I), resolved. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 38-year-old patient from Luque, a dressmaker, known to be hypertensive and on irregular treatment with Losartan 50 mg/day. Obstetric and gynaecological history of three pregnancies, two births, one stillbirth and refers that her mother has been a carrier of arthritis since the age of 50.She reports a clinical picture of terebrante pain located in the interphalangeal joints radiating bilaterally and symmetrically to the wrist with signs of inflammation and functional impotence, predominantly in the morning, of 11 months of evolution; three months before admission, a feverish sensation was added to the picture, predominantly at night with profuse sweating accompanied by progressive dyspnoea, first on moderate exertion and then on mild exertion. Three weeks before admission, pain with the same characteristics migrated to the left ankle and became bilateral and symmetrical, and did not subside with common analgesics. Two weeks before admission, due to the persistence of the symptoms, she consulted a doctor who requested complementary studies and found a sudden drop in haemoglobin levels, and indicated referral to the Haematology Department.Two days before admission to the department, the symptoms (arthralgias, fever and dyspnoea) were exacerbated and the patient went to the emergency department where she was assessed by a haematologist who requested additional tests. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the ward with the following laboratory results. Data of value on physical examination were: On ectoscopy, dyspnoeic fascies, pallor of skin and mucous membranes; in the respiratory system, poor respiratory mechanics, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, on percussion, dullness in both bases, on auscultation, subcrepitant in both midfields, abolished in both bases; in the cardiovascular system, heart sounds with regular rhythm, tachycardia, R1 and R2 hypophonetic, no galloping, diastolic murmur in aortic focus and holosystolic in mitral focus with irradiation to the axilla; abdomen soft, depressible, not painful, slight splenomegaly, no palpable hepatomegaly; in the osteoarticular system, inflammatory signs at the level of the right knee. No inflammatory signs in other joints. Based on these data, the following diagnoses were proposed: left heart failure, mitroaortic insufficiency, collagenopathy to be confirmed, anaemic syndrome, controlled arterial hypertension. In the following days the patient presented febrile peaks and polycultures were performed. A volume of concentrated red blood cells was transfused and the patient's dyspnoea worsened, having previously returned a negative direct Coombs' test. A simple CT scan of the chest showed a diffuse interstitial pattern with bilateral pleural effusion in both bases, and so, with the possibility of collagenopathy, boluses of methylprednisolone (5 grams) were started, to which she responded favourably. Rheumatological profiles were requested (ANA, anti DNA, anti CCP, C3, C4, Anti B2 glycoprotein, Antiphospholipid, Anticardiolipin, Lupus anticoagulant, Antithrombin III, Prot.C and S) which all returned in the normal range except FR in dilution 1/512. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing vegetation on the aortic and mitral valves, with pseudoaneurysm of one aortic and one mitral leaflet, as well as perforation of one aortic leaflet, which led to a diagnosis of endocarditis and empirical antibiotic therapy was started immediately, even though the laboratory tests returned with few variations. Days later, blood cultures returned positive for Streptococcus alpha haemolyticus in 3 of 8 bottles. Subsequently, the patient underwent bivalvular replacement with mechanical valves, which was successful. She returns the results of the pathological anatomy of the vegetations which reports the following: "Cardiac valves with marked degenerative changes (fibrosis, hyalinisation and myxoid changes). There are also numerous reactive fibroblasts, some of them with changes suggestive of previous rheumatological pathology. On the surface there is a marked acute inflammatory infiltrate and fibrin deposits corresponding to vegetations. The histological findings are compatible with acute bacterial endocarditis"  The definitive anatomopathological diagnosis is Acute Bacterial Endocarditis due to the visualisation of Anitschkow cells, which due to the chronicity of the symptoms is clinically presumed to be Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis, with suspected comorbidity, a collagenopathy to be confirmed with subsequent follow-up |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 72-year-old male, allergic to penicillin and intolerant to tramadol and metformin, with criteria of metabolic syndrome (with central obesity). He has been diagnosed with hypertension (HT), dyslipidaemia (DLP) and DM2 for a long time, with erratic control of these CVRF to date. Ex-smoker for about 8 years. Multifactorial chronic kidney disease (CKD) with creatinine levels around 1.5 mg/dl, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAHS) with indication for CPAP. He had undergone lumbar canal surgery five years earlier (posterior cord electrostimulator, under follow-up by the pain unit) and resection of colon polyps (benign). His cardiological history begins in the 1990s, when he was diagnosed with ischaemic heart disease (debut as AMI), with three-vessel disease on coronary angiography. He underwent surgical revascularisation by double bypass: internal mammary artery (IMA) to anterior descending artery (ADA) and saphenous vein to circumflex artery (ACx); without approaching the right coronary artery (RCA) due to severe and diffuse disease. He was assessed for the first time in 2010 in the HF unit of his hospital due to clinical worsening, with the finding of ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 35-40%) in transthoracic echocardiography, unknown until then. Repeat coronary angiography showed patency of the AMI-ADA bypass, with occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to ACx (thin vessel and diffuse disease), which was considered for conservative management. First admission for HF in 2015, with decompensation occurring in the context of atrial flutter, which underwent cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. Implantation of a single-chamber ICD for primary prevention that same year, with no arrhythmic events to date. New admission for dyspnoea and chest pain in 2016, with no notable changes in the control coronary angiography. More than two admissions throughout 2017, with clear clinical deterioration, for which an assessment was requested in our HF unit two years ago. On consultation, the patient reported minimal effort dyspnoea (NYHA III), chronic two-pillow orthopnoea and bendopnoea, without clear paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. There were also signs of water retention, mainly oedema in the lower limbs (lower limbs). No clinical data suggestive of low output. Regular blood pressure control at home with ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) of around 160 mmHg. Physical examination showed good general condition. Conscious and oriented in all three spheres. Tendency to hypertension (160/90 mmHg). Heart rate (HR) 70 bpm. Basal saturation 94%. Weight 119 kilograms (kg). Height 1.72 metres (m). Body mass index (BMI) 40.2 kg/m . Obesity class III. Auscultation is rhythmic and there are no murmurs. Minimal crackles at the bases. Abdomen soft and depressible, without palpable masses or megaliths. MMII with oedema from the knee. Acceptable distal capillary refill. The treatment he was taking at the time is summarised below: acenocoumarol for target INR 2-3, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg 1-0-0, carvedilol 25 mg 0.5-0-0.5, enalapril 20 mg 1-0-1, eplerenone 25 mg 0-1-0, furosemide 40 mg 2-2-0, chlorthalidone 50 mg half tablet every other day, atorvastatin 40 mg 0-0-1, omeprazole 20 mg 1-0-0, tiotropium bromide one inhalation per day, insulin aapid 34-32-38, paracetamol and metamizole on demand.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION In the first consultation assessment and, given the clinical situation and analytical results (see analytical 1 in complementary tests), it was decided to start neurohormonal medication for HF with reduced ejection fraction (EFred), increasing the dose of beta-blocker (carvedilol was increased to 25 mg every 12 hours). Enalapril is replaced by sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg every 12 hours (with a blanking period due to prior treatment with ACE inhibitors). The dose of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) is doubled to 50 mg eplerenone daily. ASA was also discontinued, maintaining oral anticoagulation. It was decided to add ezemitiba as lipid-lowering treatment for LDL outside the target range for ischaemic patients. Given the results of glycated haemoglobin (Hb1Ac) and given that this was a patient with HF, a sodium-glucose cotransporter receptor inhibitor (iSGLT2) was added: empagliflozin 10 mg every 24 hours. Given the volemia situation in the consultation and, prioritising the titration of drugs for HF with FEred, the dose of furosemide was reduced to 2-1-0 and chlorthalidone was discontinued. On the other hand, a reduction in the need for diuretics was expected after starting iSGLT2. The patient was assessed again after 6 months in consultations. He has not been admitted for decompensation of HF and suggests clinical stability. He reported improvement in functional class, with current dyspnoea on moderate exertion (NYHA II), although he was still limited by muscular pain related to his lumbar pathology. He also reports a significant reduction in oedema in the lower limbs and has lost about 8 kg in weight since the last visit (he acknowledges better dietary compliance). He periodically monitors his blood pressure, with TAS values of around 130-140 mmHg. On examination, the patient is in good general condition. Haemodynamically stable with BP 140/80 mmHg. HR 55 bpm. O2 saturation 95%. Weight 111 kg. Height 1.72 m. BMI 37.5 kg/m . Obesity class II. Minimal crackles on auscultation, with limitation of oedema to the bimalleolar area. Good distal capillary filling persists. The clinical improvement corresponds with the analytical results (see analytical 2 in complementary tests), showing a reduction of NT-proBNP from 3463 pg/ml to 1010 pg/ml. Glycaemic and lipid control, although still outside target values, has also improved (HbA1c has been reduced to 8% and LDL is around 90 mg/dl). At this visit, it was decided to increase the dose of sacubitril/valsartan to 49/51 mg every 12 hours due to good clinical and haemodynamic tolerance, with no deterioration in renal function. Atorvastatin was replaced by rosuvastatin in an attempt to achieve target LDL. Finally, given the clinical context (DM2 patient with obesity and poor glycaemic control, under treatment with insulin and iSGLT2), it was decided to add a 1glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (aGLP1): subcutaneous liraglutide 0.6 mg/day for one week and then 1.2 mg/day. At the new clinical review, the patient again reported subjective improvement, with no admissions for HF. He has lost another 7 kg in weight and is more agile, having started physical activity (he does pilates). He remains in NYHA functional class II, with better control of lumbar discomfort by the pain unit. His blood pressure continues to be in the target range (ambulatory blood pressure around 120-130 mmHg). No data suggesting water retention, with remission of oedema in the lower limbs. No adverse effects attributable to the use of iSGLT2 or ARGLP1. At the consultation examination the patient weighs 104 kg, which means a reduction in BMI to 35.6 kg/m2 (class II obesity). Blood pressure 135/78 mmHg. HR 62 bpm. Sat 95%. No evidence of congestion or low output. The blood test showed a reduction in NT-proBNP to 835 pg/ml. The evolution of Hb1Ac continues to be favourable (7%) and LDL is practically in the target range (76 mg/dl). It was decided to continue outpatient follow-up, maintaining check-ups every 6-9 months in consultations, given the situation of clinical stability.  DIAGNOSIS HF with reduced EF. Initial CF III with clinical and analytical improvement after titration of neuhormonal medication. Currently NYHA II. Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 35%) of ischaemic aetiology. Surgically revascularised chronic ischaemic heart disease: IMA-ADA and saphenous bypass to ACx. Subsequent control coronary angiography with patency of the mammary graft and occlusion of the saphenous graft (severe and diffuse disease), for conservative management. ACD thin and diffusely diseased vessel, discouraged for revascularisation. Metabolic syndrome with type III obesity and poor initial control of classic CVRFs. Improvement of metabolic control and weight reduction with medical treatment (aGLP1). Current BMI 35.6 kg/m2 (type II obesity). DM2 better controlled after initiation of iSGLT2 and aGLP1. Multifactorial chronic CKD with creatinine levels stable at around 1.3-1.5 mg/dl. Ex-smoker. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 60-year-old male, with no known drug allergies and no family history of interest. Personal history of: Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): obesity, arterial hypertension and ex-smoker Surgical intervention of vasectomy complicated with epididymitis 32 years ago On treatment with amlodipine 5 mg at breakfast.  Current illness He presented with 5 months of progressive exertional dyspnoea with frank worsening in the last month to NYHA class III, associated with oedema of the lower extremities up to the abdominal wall, orthopnoea and decreased diuresis, for which he attended the emergency department. In the initial study in the ED, after finding elevated D-dimer and signs of right heart failure, it was decided to perform a thoracic CT angiography, initially ruling out pulmonary thromboembolism but revealing thickening and moderate pericardial effusion. Hospital admission was decided.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 130/80 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 128 bpm, profuse diaphoresis, sensation of gravity, although good distal perfusion. Head and neck: jugular ingurgitation with hepatojugular reflux. Cardiac auscultation: irregular and muffled sounds. Pulmonary auscultation: global hypophonesis with crackles in the right base. Abdomen: distended, wall oedema with fovea. Lower limbs: oedema with fovea up to the root of the thighs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG): atrial fibrillation at 115 bpm with decreased QRS amplitude. EV isolated. The corrected QT interval is normal. Chest X-ray: right costophrenic sinus impingement and marked cardiomegaly. Laboratory tests (in the ED): NT-proBNP of 114 pg/ml. Haemogram, renal function parameters and ionogram in normal ranges. Coagulation normal except for elevated D-dimer: 1100 mg/dl. CBC (hospitalisation): normal haemogram, ESR 51 mm/h. Normal blood biochemistry, normal transaminases and ions. Normal iron profile Immunoglobulins: IgG 1170 mg/dl (768-1632), IgA 395 mg/dl (68-378), IgM 115 mg/dl (60-263). Beta 2 microglobulin: 3.72 mcg/ml (1.9-2.53). Interferon gamma-TBC: negative. Serology: HIV, HBV, HCV, Lues, EBV, HSV: negative. Pathological anatomy of pericardial fluid: positive cytology for malignancy. Immunohistochemical study: CD79a+, CD3+ in accompanying cellularity, PAX5+, CD20+, Bcl2+, Bcl6-, MUM1+, C-Myc weakly positive in 40% of cells, CD10-, CD30-, EBER-, CD138-, CD38-, HHV8: negative. Ki 67: 80%. Compatible with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Flow cytometry of pericardial fluid: in the sample analysed 77% of lymphocytes were observed, 95% of which correspond to an apparently mature B population (CD20+, FMC7+, CD10-) and without intracytoplasmic TdT, suggesting a B lymphoproliferative process with a non-specific phenotype. Pericardial fluid culture: no development of microorganisms. Pathological anatomy of the iliac crest (bone biopsy): normocellular bone marrow, no infiltration by lymphoma. Chest CT scan: subpleural pseudonodule 10 mm in diameter located in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe to be monitored. Moderate pericardial effusion with wall thickening. Cardiac cavities within normal. Ascitic fluid. Dorsal spondylosis. PET-CT: imaging shows no significant hypermetabolism in the thickened pericardium. Small left laterocervical, supraclavicular lymph nodes with SUV max 1.33, infracentimetric and an analogous one on the right with SUV max 1.9. In the mediastinum small lymph nodes with SUV max 1.57, the largest 12.8 mm and highest metabolic activity SUV max 2.5. Retroperitoneal small crural, pericellular and para-aortic nodes with low metabolic SUV 1.08. Hypermetabolic lesion (SUV max 9) hyperdense and irregular morphology in left testicle highly suggestive of malignancy. Testicular ultrasound: image of a 10 mm spermatocele in the head of the left epididymis and changes secondary to left vasectomy. Left testicular pathological anatomy: left orchiectomy specimen: no evidence of neoplasia. Acute and chronic epididymitis associated with fibrous and histiocytic reaction. Testicular parenchyma and spermatic cord without histological alterations. Transthoracic echocardiogram: preserved left ventricular systolic function (52%), moderate biauricular dilatation and severe pericardial effusion with evidence of visceral pericardial thickening without cavity collapse or respiratory variations of valvular flows. Control transthoracic echocardiogram: LVEF 61%, mild pericardial effusion, without clear evidence of constrictive physiology.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted for study and treatment with the combined participation of the cardiology, internal medicine and haematology departments. Initially, the patient showed little response to depletive treatment, with persistence of marked signs of right heart failure and systolic blood pressure around 90-100 mmHg, although without clear evidence of haemodynamic compromise. He maintained a good response to atrioventricular (AV) node braking therapy and anticoagulation by CHASVASC:2 and HASBLED:1 with rivaroxaban was initiated. As part of the complementary study, transthoracic echocardiography showed severe pericardial effusion without significant repercussions on the right chambers, and a diagnostic-therapeutic pericardiocentesis was considered. This technique yielded 950 cc of serohaematic fluid with a clear immediate clinical improvement and samples were sent to microbiology and pathological anatomy, for filiation of the effusion, which finally demonstrated the presence of blast cells compatible with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with no infectious microbiological evidence. The study was completed with a PET-CT scan showing lymphadenopathy with slight increased metabolism and a hypercapillary lesion in the left testicle (image 4) with metabolic criteria of malignancy, and we requested a testicular ultrasound scan which did not reveal a clear malignant testicular mass (10 mm spermatocele in the head of the left epididymis and changes secondary to vasectomy). Given that the origin of the malignant process had not been identified and the patient was not in a suitable clinical condition to take a biopsy of the pericardium or mediastinal lymph nodes by thoracoscopy, the case was assessed by the haematological tumour committee and given the intense PET-CT uptake in the left testicle, a diagnostic orchiectomy was decided for assessment of malignancy at this level, given the prognostic and therapeutic implications of testicular involvement by high-grade lymphoma. With the diagnosis of high-grade B lymphoma in the pericardium, it was decided not to delay chemotherapy treatment with R-CHOP/21, administering the first cycle (with Truxima) and with no immediate adverse reactions. We performed a control transthoracic echocardiogram with mild pericardial effusion and increased LVEF (61%). Oedema resolved and he remained cardiologically stable. There were no complications with haematological treatment, so it was decided to discharge him and continue his treatment on an outpatient basis. Weeks later, the result of the testicular biopsy was negative for malignancy.  DIAGNOSIS Effusivoconstrictive pericarditis. Atrial fibrillation with rapid mid ventricular response first episode. Congestive heart failure with preserved LVEF. Stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of a 49-year-old woman, a professional climber, with episodes of transient ischaemic attacks. She never had chest pain, dyspnoea or any of the other symptoms we are accustomed to recording in our histories, but she presented a compendium of cardiac alterations that allowed us to get to the top of her pathology.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No drug allergies. Toxic habits: smoker of 7 cigarettes/day. No other known cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). Professional climber. No usual treatment.  Current illness Our patient was admitted to the neurology department for an episode of hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia in the right hemibody, self-limited for 2 to 3 hours 2 months ago. One month ago, episode of paresis in the right hemisphere, which she recovered within half an hour. Last episode the day before admission, with the same characteristics but of longer duration. At no time did she report chest pain, dyspnoea or other cardiological symptoms. During the study, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiogram were performed, which showed alterations, so an assessment was requested.  Physical examination Good general condition, well hydrated and perfused. Blood pressure (BP) 118/71 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 65 bpm. Afebrile. Eupneic at rest. Jugular venous pressure normal. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic at 60 bpm, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen without alterations. Lower limbs: no oedema, pulses preserved.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. PR 140 msg. Narrow QRS. Q wave in V1-V4, DI and aVL with isodiphasic T wave in V2-V4, flat in V5-V6, DI and aVL and inferior leads. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, no evidence of heart failure. Laboratory tests: CBC: haemoglobin 14.3 g/dl, leucocytes 5,600/μl with normal formula, platelets 190,000/μl. Coagulation: INR 1, TTPa 29 s. Biochemistry: glucose 88 mg/dl, urea 29 mg/dl, creatinine 0.68 mg/dl, FGR > 60 ml/min, Na 140 mmol/l, K 4.8 mmol/l, total cholesterol 136 mg/dl, HDL 52 mg/dl, LDL 71 mg/dl, TG 64 mg/dl, Inmonoglubulins normal. CRP < 1 mg/dl. Rheumatoid factor < 10 IU/ml. Folic acid and vitamin B12 normal. Autoimmunity: negative. Complement normal. Thyroid hormone normal. Hb1Ac 5.3%. Factor Leiden factor and factor II 20,210 negative. Homocysteine normal. Proteinogram normal. Serology: HIV, Herpes simplex, EBV, CMV, Brucella, Lues and Borrelia negative. Echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) slightly dilated with severe depression of LVEF (25-30%), with extensive apical akinesia and remodelling, extensive anterior akinesia, lower mid-apical and mid-apical septum. Grade II mitral regurgitation. Mobile thrombus in LV apex measuring 18 x 8 mm. Haemodynamic study: right dominance. No coronary calcification. Coronary disease of 1 vessel. Left main coronary artery without significant stenosis. Anterior descending occluded at the origin, with TIMI 0 distal flow. The distal vessel is visualised by homo- and heterocoronary circulation. The appearance of the distal vessel is highly suggestive of spiroid dissection and haematoma of the anterior descending artery from its origin. Right circumflex and coronary artery of good calibre and development, with smooth edges, without angiographically significant stenosis. Renal angiography: rectilinear right renal artery with small deformations along its entire course, in both arterial borders. Double left arterial system. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): LV of normal size with mid-apical anterior akinesia, apical lateral, apical septum, apical inferior and apex. Severe hypokinesia of medial septum, medial lateral, medial inferior. LVEF 36%. Hypoperfusion of the middle segment of the anterior wall and middle septum, middle segment of the lateral wall and all apical segments. Very extensive transmural late enhancement of the basal, mid and apical segments of the anterior wall, apical inferior, mid-apical lateral, mid anterior septum, apical septum and the entire apex. Large apical thrombus (28 x 9 mm), mobile. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size. Normal right atrium (RA). Left atrium (LA) slightly dilated. Cranial CT: corticosubcortical hypodensity in the left parietal convexity and in the nuclei of the left base, which may correspond to ischaemic lesions. Doubtful hyperdensity at the level of the top of the basilar artery, without identifying ischaemic lesions in the posterior circulation. Normal ventricular system. Centred midline. Echo Doppler of supra-aortic trunks: no alterations. Ambulatory control echocardiogram: dilated LV with akinesia of the mid-apical segments of the anterior and lateral face, apical of the inferior septum and inferior face, with apical aneurysmal image. Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 35%). Normal sized RV with preserved systolic function. Mild LA dilatation. Protomesystolic mitral regurgitation located between A2-P2, mild-moderate grade (grade II). No other valvular abnormalities. Normal pericardium. Apical thrombus image measuring 14 x 7 mm, without mobile structures, resting on the area of the aneurysm. Compared to the previous study, there is a reduction in the volume of the thrombus.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to neurology with a diagnosis of left hemispheric embolic stroke with good clinical evolution. She was assessed by cardiology with the diagnosis of extensive anterior myocardial infarction with severe depression of LVEF and mobile apical thrombus, due to spontaneous coronary dissection probably related to intense exercise. The study was completed with cardiac MRI. During outpatient follow-up, medical treatment was titrated, limited by low BP and HR figures, up to maximum tolerated doses: Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg daily, acenocoumarol for INR between 2 and 3, omeprazole 20 mg daily, sacubitril/valsartan 49/51 mg every 12 hours, carvedilol 3.125 mg every 12 hours, spironolactone 25 mg daily, atorvastatin 10 mg daily. An echocardiogram was performed 3 months after optimising medication, with an LVEF of 35% in NYHA functional class II, so it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention.

We present the case of a 62-year-old patient with asthenia in which the physical examination is key.  HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): ex-smoker of 1 pack a day for 24 years (IPA: 38) Cardiological history: acute idiopathic pericarditis diagnosed 5 years ago. Medical history: chronic venous insufficiency, rhizarthrosis. Surgical history: surgery for Dupuytren's disease in the left hand. Family history: not relevant Home treatment: chondroitin sulphate, paracetamol on demand.  Current illness A 62-year-old woman with a history of acute idiopathic pericarditis and mild pericardial effusion diagnosed 5 years ago, requiring anti-inflammatory treatment. She was subsequently examined by the internal medicine department for constitutional syndrome without finding any apparent cause. She was referred for outpatient cardiology consultation due to dyspnoea and asthenia on moderate exertion (NYHA functional class II/IV) together with episodes of dizziness and presyncope on exertion, which limited her daily life. No orthopnoea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND), no oliguria, no chest pain or syncopal episodes.  Physical examination  In consultation: Not hydrated and normal colour. Afebrile. Eupneic. BP 130/70. Basal oxygen saturation: 95%. Jugular venous pressure (JVP) elevated up to the mandibular angle with Kussmaul's sign present. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds with obvious protodiastolic knock. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without added sounds. Abdomen: soft, depressible, slight non-painful hepatomegaly. MMII: pulses present at all levels. No oedema  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. PR 160ms. Narrow QRS. Axis 50o. Asymmetric negative T wave in inferior and lateral face, suggestive of left ventricular overload. QTc within normal limits. Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index in the upper limit of normality. Prominent pulmonary artery cone. No evidence of vascular redistribution. Slight calcification of the aortic arch. Pinching of both posterior costodiaphragmatic sinuses. No pericardial calcification. Dorsal kyphosis. Blood tests: Haemogram: 7900 leukocytes/mm3 (normal leukocyte formula), haemoglobin 12.5/dl, haematocrit 36.9%, platelets 150,000/mm . Coagulation: INR 1.08, prothrombin activity 88%. Biochemistry: creatinine 0.82 mg/dl (glomerular filtration rate 65 ml/min/)m, urea 46 mg/dl, ions normal. NT-proBNP 540pg/ml. Hb1AC 5.8%, thyroid profile and cholesterol levels within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal size, not hypertrophic with preserved systolic function (62% by Simpson biplane) without segmental abnormalities of contractility. Normal diastolic function. Normal sized right ventricle with tubular morphology suggesting pericardial tethering. Meandering motion of the interatrial septum with protodiastolic notch in M-mode. Mild tricuspid regurgitation without other valvulopathies. Decreased mitral E wave velocity with inspiration. Dilated inferior vena cava with absence of respiratory variability; dilated suprahepatic veins, retrograde D wave in pulsed Doppler mode increasing with inspiration. Pericardium apparently normal with no pericardial effusion. No indirect data of pulmonary hypertension by echocardiographic study. Cardiac MRI: left ventricle (LV) of normal size with preserved LVEF (60%). Right ventricle (RV) of normal size and function. Atrial chambers of normal size. Focal pericardial thickening with a maximum thickness of 6.5 mm at the lateral wall of the RV in the atrioventricular (AV) groove. Prominent inferior vena cava (IVC) with dilatation of the suprahepatic veins. No pathological gadolinium uptake on late enhancement sequences. No pericardial effusion. Left heart catheterisation: coronary arteries without angiographically significant stenosis. Right heart catheterisation: cardiac output 4.96 l/min; IC 3.2 l/min. Pulmonary arterial resistance (1.21 Wood units). AD 15 mmHg with deep sinus "y". Equalized end-diastolic pressures in both ventricles with ventricular interdependence phenomenon with inspiration. PAP 34/24/15 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) 18 mmHg. Ventriculography: LV of normal size (VTD 55 ml/m2; VTS 20 ml/m2.) EF 64%. No mitral regurgitation was observed.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After the initial evaluation in the consultation room, a blood analysis was requested with parameters within normal parameters, including an NT-proBNP value of 540 pg/ml, (within normal limits for age) and an echocardiogram which showed data compatible with constrictive pericarditis that would justify the patient's clinical symptoms of asthenia. A cardiac MRI was also requested, which revealed focal thickening of the pericardium at the level of the RV in the AV groove, which caused a haemodynamically significant constrictive physiology that could explain the patient's symptoms of presyncope and low cardiac output on exertion. Prior to presenting the case at the medical-surgical session, a left haemodynamic study was requested which showed coronary arteries without significant stenosis and a right heart catheterisation which confirmed the diagnosis of constrictive physiology. The case was presented jointly with the cardiac surgery service and the patient was accepted for surgery, and the operation was performed 2 months later. Intraoperatively she presented severe pericardial adhesions with severe pericardial thickening at the level of the lateral aspect of the RV, extending towards the intercaval line and lateral aspect of the LV without pericardial calcification, and interphrenic pericardiectomy was performed, confirming by pathological anatomy the fibrous thickening of the pericardium with intense chronic inflammation. After the intervention, the patient reported neither asthenia nor the presyncopal episodes she had previously presented, and was in NYHA functional class I/IV.  DIAGNOSIS Focal constrictive pericarditis with haemodynamic repercussions. Preserved biventricular function. Successful interphrenic pericardiectomy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 66-year-old woman consulted for dyspnoea and oedema in the lower limbs.  History No known drug allergies. She denies toxic habits. Cardiovascular risk factors: dyslipidaemia. Type 2 diabetes under treatment with oral antidiabetics with good control (last HbA1c 6.8%). Permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with warfarin. Rheumatic valvular heart disease with severe mitral stenosis and moderate double aortic lesion, operated on 19-June-18. Mitral and aortic valve replacement with mechanical prostheses. Postoperative period uncomplicated, except for anaemia which required transfusion of 1 red blood cell concentrate. Discharged from hospital on 28 June 2018. Home treatment after surgery: omeprazole 20 mg daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg every 12 hours, pravastatin 40 mg daily, warfarin 10 mg according to haematology guidelines and gliclazide 30 mg every 12 hours.  Present illness Patient admitted from the emergency department for progressive dyspnoea until minimal effort and oedema in the lower limbs 2 weeks after being discharged following valve replacement surgery. She associated two-pillow orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea crises. The patient denied non-adherence to treatment or dietary transgressions. On arrival at the emergency department, atrial flutter was observed with rapid ventricular response and congestive data on examination, and the patient was admitted to hospital by the cardiology department.  Physical examination General condition preserved. Conscious and oriented. Well hydrated and perfused. Pallor of skin and mucous membranes. Blood pressure 125/80 mmHg. Eupneic at rest, with basal oxygen saturation 94%. Heart rate 100 bpm. No jugular ingurgitation or hepatojugular reflux. Cardiorespiratory auscultation: arrhythmic heart at about 100 bpm. Prosthetic metallic click. No audible murmurs. Good pulmonary ventilation with slight crackles in both lung bases, with no other added pathological sounds. Abdomen: no masses or megaliths, not painful on deep palpation. No evidence of peritoneal irritation. Oedema up to the knees with fovea.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests in the emergency department: Haemogram: 7430 leucocytes with normal formula, haemoglobin 9 g/dl, MCV 90.60 fl, platelets 179000. Coagulation: INR 2.07. Biochemistry: normal renal function and ionogram. C-reactive protein 58.1 mg/l. NT-proBNP 1404 pg/dl. Serial myocardial damage enzymes: CK 36 - 22 U/l, ultrasensitive troponin T 28 - 31 ng/l. Electrocardiogram: atrial flutter with variable ventricular response around 120 bpm. Normal axis. Narrow QRS. Good R progression in precordial leads. Negative T waves V4-V6, without other repolarisation alterations. Transthoracic echocardiography: non-dilated left ventricle with mild concentric hypertrophy. Dilated left atrium. Normal right chambers. Sections of aorta studied within normality. Valves: normopositioned mechanical mitral prosthesis and no nodding, with preserved disc mobility, no signs of insufficiency and mean gradient 4 mmHg (video 1). Normopositioned mechanical aortic prosthesis with no pitching, preserved disc mobility, no insufficiency jets and normal anterograde gradients (maximum velocity 2.3 m/sec). Preserved left ventricular systolic function estimated at 60% by biplane Simpson, without segmental contractility disorders. Preserved right ventricular systolic function. Absence of pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Initial evolution was favourable after intravenous diuretic treatment and transfusion of blood products. However, on the sixth day of admission, the patient's platelet count dropped from 160,000 to 23,000. Given the suspicion of heparin-induced thrombopenia (HIT), it was decided to replace this drug with fondaparinux and antiplatelet factor IV antibodies were requested, which were found to be positive. After replacing heparin with fondaparinux, platelets progressively rose to normal, allowing the reintroduction of warfarin, his usual anticoagulant therapy. During treatment with fondaparinux, there were no haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Before discharge, a new echocardiogram was performed and both prosthetic valves were found to be normally functioning and showed no evidence of thrombosis. Intercurrently, the patient presented with micturition symptoms with dysuria, frequency of urination and urinary urgency; a urine culture showed E. coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (E. coli BLEE+). Given the patient's high comorbidity and the risk of endocarditis in the event of bacteraemia due to the recent implantation of two mechanical prostheses, it was decided to start broad-spectrum antibiotherapy with ertapenem. Two days after starting treatment with ertapenem, the patient developed generalised polyarthralgia, predominantly in the lower limbs, and non-pruritic skin lesions, which progressively worsened, some of them acquiring a bull's-eye morphology. Suspecting toxicoderma due to ertapenem, we replaced this drug with fosfomycin, and the symptoms resolved completely within 48 hours. A skin biopsy was obtained with a result of small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis compatible with genuine serum sickness or sickness associated with taking the drugs, findings consistent with the initial suspicion of ertapenem-induced toxicoderma.  DIAGNOSIS Decompensation of heart failure in association with: Subacute normocytic anaemia in probable relation to surgery. Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. Heparin-induced thrombopenia (HIT). BLEE+ E. coli urinary tract infection. Small vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to administration of carbapenemics (ertapenem). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION An 82-year-old man came to our emergency department for chest pain.  History Allergic to penicillins with tolerance to cephalosporins. Toxic habits: ex-smoker (IPA 30 pack-years). Cardivascular risk factors (CVRF): arterial hypertension (AHT). Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on chronic bronchodilator treatment. Solitary pulmonary nodule, monitored by the pulmonology department, unchanged since 2008. Multinodular goitre.  Cardiological history: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (first episode in 2013 in context of admission for septic shock and second episode documented during postoperative knee surgery in January 2020). On anticoagulant treatment with acenocoumarol. In 2017, after surgery for sacral ulcer, episode of chest pain compatible with unstable angina. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with no abnormalities, preserved LVEF. An outpatient study was completed with ergometry, negative for ischaemia. During postoperative knee surgery in January 2020, he presented with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) with an electrocardiographic image compatible with a left main coronary artery lesion. Given the patient's fragility, he was managed conservatively and discharged with triple antithrombotic therapy (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA] + clopidogrel + acenocoumarol). Last TTE (March 2020): preserved LVEF without segmental contractility abnormalities, mild aortic root dilatation, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation (grade II). Rest unchanged with respect to previous study.  Digestive history: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) with grade IV/IV oesophagitis and duodenitis. Achalasia in 2004. Oesophageal diverticulectomy with anti-reflux myocardiomyotomy (2008), complicated with respiratory infection by P. aeruginosa, sacral eschar infection by E. coli. Cholecystectomy for alliasic cholecystitis. Diverticulosis of the colon with haemorrhage. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy for iron deficiency anaemia in 2018: chronic gastritis as the only notable finding. Pedunculated polyp at 30 cm from the anal margin of approximately 1.5 cm that is resected. Multiple diverticula along the entire explored tract. Angiodysplasia of the intestine with isolated haemorrhage in 2015. Baseline functional status: independent for basic activities of daily living, walks with a cane. Higher functions preserved. Usual treatment: omeprazole 40 mg; acenocoumarol 4 mg as prescribed; clopidogrel 75 mg; ASA 100 mg; bisoprolol 2.5 mg per day; losartan 50 mg per day; atorvastatin 40 mg; lorazepam 1 mg; mirtazapine 15 mg.  Present illness The patient starts with oppressive central thoracic discomfort on the night before going to the medical services. On the day of admission in the morning, a new episode of sudden onset pain, radiating to the back and neck. She reported no melena, vomiting or macroscopic bleeding in previous days. On arrival at the emergency department, pain persisted with a tendency to arterial hypotension, tachypnoea and poor distal perfusion. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed diffuse ST-segment depression, with elevation in aVR, suggestive of a lesion in the left main coronary artery. Emergency echocardioscopy was performed, showing moderate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Transfer to the coronary unit and emergency coronary angiography was decided. GRACE risk scale: 36.7% in-hospital mortality, 61.5% estimated risk of death at one year. CRUSADE risk scale: 59 points, 19.5% risk of major in-hospital bleeding, very high haemorrhagic risk.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 95/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR) 80 bpm; oxygen saturation 90% with nasal goggles at 3 bpm; afebrile. Conscious and oriented. Mucocutaneous pallor, poor distal perfusion, tachypneic. Jugular plethora. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation with bilateral pulmonary crackles up to midfields. Abdomen: soft, depressible, non-painful. Discrete lividity in the lower extremities and hands. No palpable paedial pulses, no oedema or evidence of venous thrombosis in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on admission to the ED: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, normal PR, QRS axis at 30o, diffuse ST-segment depression, maximum of 4 mm in V5-V6, with ST-segment elevation of 1 mm in V1 and 2 mm in aVR. ECG after catheterisation: atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 80 bpm, ST-segment elevation in V2-V5 (maximum 2 mm in V4). ECG at discharge from the coronary unit: common atrial flutter with ventricular response at 75 bpm, Q waves in inferior face. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, increased perihilar density predominantly on the right with associated pleural effusion. Laboratory tests on admission: glucose 102 mg/dl, urea 66 mg/dl, Cr 1.39 mg/dl, GPT 13 U/l, Bi 0.2 mg/dl, Ca 9.9 mg/dl, albumin 4.2 g/dl, Na 132 mEq/l, K 4,3 mEq/l, Cl 96 mEq/l, CK 142 U/l, TnT US 146 ng/l (normal 0-14 ng/l), Hb 6.5 g/dl, (MCV 84 fl, MCH 25 pg, ADE 15.9%), platelets 351.000/ul, leukocytes 12.510/ul (75% neutrophilia). Coagulation in normal range. Enzymatic peak: maximum CK 1.237 U/l, maximum troponin T us 4.224 ng/l. Other analytical results: lipidogram: total cholesterol 123 mg/dL, triglycerides 127 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 48 mg/dL and LDL 50 mg/dL. HbA1c 5.6%  Microbiology: SARS-CoV2 serology: negative. SARS-CoV2 PCR: not detectable. On admission to the coronary unit, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was isolated in a nasal sample. Gram-negative coccobacilli colonies were isolated in sputum, with growth of Haemophilus influenzae. Sacral ulcer culture isolated gram-positive cocci, with growth of MRSA. Echocardiogram on admission: dilated LV (DTD 70 mm), with mild septal LV hypertrophy (LVH) (IVS 13 mm, LVSP 10 mm). Moderately to severely depressed LV systolic function (LVEF 30%) due to akinesia of the apex, mid-apical anterior septum, lateral and anterior face. Restrictive relaxation pattern (type III). Aortic root not dilated (36 mm). Sclerocalcified aortic valve, trivalve, with good opening and mild insufficiency. Moderately dilated LA. Sclerocalcified mitral valve, thickened leaflets, with moderate-severe regurgitation consisting of two jets reaching both atrial roofs but no reverse flow in pulmonary veins. Mildly dilated right ventricle (RV) (baseline DTD 42 mm). Borderline RV systolic function (TAPSE 15 mm). Tricuspid insufficiency (TI) mild-moderate. Vd-Ad gradient 45 mmHg. Inferior vena cava (IVC) mildly dilated with complete inspiratory collapse (> 50%). Estimated PSAP 55 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram prior to discharge: normal LVEF (53%). No significant valvulopathies. No data suggesting significant pulmonary hypertension. Emergent coronary angiography on admission: common trunk with critical stenosis of irregular appearance in its ostium and middle segment causing a severe drop in luminal pressure during selective catheterisation of the vessel. The anterior descending artery has only non-significant irregularities. The circumflex artery is a vessel of remarkable development showing no significant lesions. Anatomically dominant right coronary artery, diffusely atheromatous, but without significant focal stenosis. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in the common trunk, with implantation of a Synergy 4 x 12 mm stent, without reaching the distal bifurcation and allowing some protrusion of the device into the sinus of Valsalva. After overexpanding the proximal portion of the stent with a 4.5 mm NC balloon, a good angiographic result was achieved. Capsule endoscopic study (during admission to the cardiology ward): absence of haematic debris throughout the examination. Angiodysplasia in the stomach with no evidence of active bleeding. Millimetric polyp in the cecum of little relevance for the patient's age and current clinical situation. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy are recommended when the patient's clinical situation permits.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During the revascularisation procedure, the patient suffers several episodes of hypotension (up to 70/40 mmHg) with poor distal perfusion and respiratory worsening. Four ampoules of i.v. furosemide are administered, oxygen therapy with FiO2 of 50% maintaining oxygen saturation > 90%. He also required boluses of phenylephrine up to 50 mcg and the start of noradrenaline perfusion up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min for TAM > 70 mmHg. He progressively showed respiratory improvement with good diuretic response and haemodynamic improvement. During his admission to the coronary unit and subsequently to the cardiology ward: Haemodynamically, he presented good clinical evolution, noradrenaline was discontinued 48 hours after admission, and he was subsequently maintained with AMT > 70 mmHg without the need for vasoactive support. He alternated sinus rhythm with spells of atrial fibrillation, requiring an occasional dose of digoxin to control the ventricular rate. Echocardioscopy 72 hours after admission showed recovery of LVEF. The TTE prior to discharge confirmed this improvement in ventricular function, with no evidence of valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension. Respiratory: improvement of congestive signs after negative water balance, maintaining oxygen saturation > 92% initially with nasal goggles and subsequently with ambient air, with no congestive signs on physical examination at discharge. Nephro-urological: forced diuresis with diuretic with good response, being possible to progressively reduce the furosemide boluses, until switching to oral administration, presenting progressive improvement of renal function until normalisation 72 hours after admission, without electrolyte alterations. Infectious: afebrile, with no need for antibiotic treatment, with negative PCR and serology for COVID-19, with maximum C-reactive protein of 64 mg/dl, but normal procalcitonin and leukocytes. Samples were taken from a pressure ulcer in the sacral area (already known), isolating MRSA, which was treated with local dressings. During her stay on the hospital ward, she presented febrile peaks of 37.2oC with cough and expectoration. When H. Influenzae was found in sputum culture, oral antibiotherapy with cephalosporins was started according to the antibiogram results. Digestive: in the analysis on admission, there was progressive anaemia (Hb July/2019: 13 g/dl -->January/2020: 10.1 g/dl --> March/2020: 8.3 g/dl) with Hb on admission of 6.5 g/dl, normocytic, hypochromic with high ADE, so despite the patient denying melena or other macroscopic bleeding, intravenous pantoprazole perfusion was started and 2 red blood cell concentrates were transfused. Subsequently, his blood counts remained stable at around 8.5 g/dl, with no signs of macroscopic bleeding and stools with no apparent haematic debris. Initially on an absolute diet, she was well tolerated when starting an oral diet. Despite having an indication for anticoagulation due to AF (CHA2DS2VASC 5, HAS BLED 5), it was initially decided to maintain double antiplatelet therapy with ASA and clopidogrel. She was referred to the gastrointestinal department of our centre, which indicated an endoscopic capsule study, after clinical stabilisation: absence of haematic debris throughout the examination. Angiodysplasias in the stomach and cecum with no active bleeding. On discharge, treatment with oral iron and follow-up in the outpatient gastroenterology department for gastroscopy/colonoscopy for electrocoagulation of the angiodysplastic lesions was decided. The time in therapeutic range (TRT) with sintrom is estimated to be in the low range for the last 6 months -TRT 53%-; therefore, treatment with clopidogrel 75 mg + rivaroxaban 15 mg/day as dual therapy is considered as a possibility for discharge, based on the strategy of the PIONEER study, which has shown the same efficacy and lower bleeding rates as the classic triple therapy with vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants and dual antiplatelet therapy. In good clinical condition, he was discharged home, with subsequent follow-up in cardiology consultations, and pending completion of a digestive study.  DIAGNOSIS Killip IV NSTEACS. Severe coronary artery disease of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) with critical lesion. Implantation of drug-eluting stent in LMCA. Severe LV systolic dysfunction recovered (at discharge LVEF 53%). Acute anaemia requiring red blood cell transfusion (probably digestive origin). Angiodysplasias in stomach and cecum. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter. Acute renal failure resolved. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 67-year-old woman came to the emergency department of our centre referred by her primary care physician with a one-week history of dyspnoea, orthopnoea and oedema in the lower limbs. Her personal history included arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus treated with oral antidiabetics, dyslipidaemia, permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol and prosthetic mitral valve replacement 6 years ago due to rheumatic stenosis with severe pulmonary hypertension. It should be mentioned that the patient had no history of known nephrourological pathology, with analytical studies prior to admission showing normal renal function, without proteinuria or sediment alterations. He was admitted to Cardiology with the diagnosis of a first episode of decompensation of heart failure, with no clear trigger.  A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed showing a normal functioning mitral prosthesis, aortic valve calcification and severe right ventricular dysfunction, with no other significant findings. On the third day of admission he presented with a fever peak related to peripheral phlebitis, so blood cultures were taken, the IV was changed and empirical antibiotic therapy with Ceftriaxone was started. In the following 24 hours, the growth of SAMS was confirmed in the blood cultures, and Ceftriaxone was replaced by intravenous Cloxacillin. A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to rule out infective endocarditis, revealing an anchored vegetative image at the level of the posterolateral mitral annulus and another, smaller, anterolateral filiform image. In view of these findings, a diagnosis of infective endocarditis due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (SAMS) on the prosthetic valve was made, and Rifampicin was added to the aforementioned treatment. The patient was assessed by the Cardiac Surgery Department and it was decided to surgically replace the prosthesis. Since then, she has had a long and complicated postoperative period, with initial multi-organ dysfunction in the context of cardiac tamponade that required urgent reintervention. In a situation of severe haemodynamic failure, with no evidence of sepsis and maintaining antibiotic coverage, he developed acute oligoanuric renal function deterioration attributed to hypoperfusion with the need for extra-renal depuration by continuous venovenous haemofiltration for a week.  Urine studies performed at this time showed decreased sodium excretion (FENa < 1%) without proteinuria or sediment alterations. In the following days, haemodynamic recovery is accompanied by a progressive increase in diuresis and improvement in renal function parameters (Crp 0.8 mg/dL), and haemofiltration can be withdrawn. He developed multiple complications during the following months, of which the most relevant are highlighted below. Eight weeks after the operation, he suffered an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, for which an endoscopic study was carried out, revealing millimetric gastric erosions of uncertain origin. Two weeks later, non-pruritic raised petechiae were found on the trunk, extremities, folds and slopes. Coinciding with the above, the urinary sediment showed proteinuria of less than 1 gram per day, with normal renal function (Crp 0.84 mg/dl). Urgent determination of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies (anti-GBM) was requested, which were negative. The dermatology department was consulted and a skin biopsy was taken, which was compatible with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and treatment with Prednisone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day was indicated.  One week later he presented with anaemia without externalisation of bleeding and a chest X-ray showed bilateral de novo interstitial infiltrates.  All this coincided with a new deterioration of renal function (Crp 1.78 mg/dL), oliguria, proteinuria of 850 mg/day, macroscopic haematuria and the presence of dysmorphic red blood cells and haematic and leukocyte casts in the urinary sediment.  Given the suspicion of pulmonary haemorrhage in an anticoagulated patient, fibrobronchoscopy was performed, confirming the presence of fresh haematic debris in both bronchial trees, suggestive of alveolar haemorrhage. Renal function progressively deteriorated, and the patient remained in a situation of oligoanuria and secondary hydrosaline overload, with persistent haematuria and proteinuria. Given the clinical diagnosis of nephritic syndrome with pulmonary haemorrhage, an immunological study was completed, highlighting a decrease in C3 (78.8 mg/dL) and C4 (14.4 mg/dL) levels, the presence of circulating immunocomplexes and positive rheumatoid factor (190 mg/dL), with negative ANAs, antiDNA, ANCAs and antiMBG, as well as negative cryoglobulins. The patient's respiratory condition progressively deteriorated, anticoagulation was discontinued, and it was decided to start treatment with plasmapheresis, oral cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day) and increasing the dose of prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) in view of the renopulmonary syndrome. Prior to the start of the immunosuppressive regimen, blood cultures were taken on several occasions and were persistently negative, although all of them were removed and the patient continued with antibiotherapy. With these measures, there was a slight improvement from the respiratory point of view, both clinically and radiologically, but the progressive deterioration of renal function persisted, again requiring extra-renal depuration by means of continuous venovenous haemofiltration. Finally, as there was no improvement in the following days, a renal biopsy was performed with the suspicion of acute glomerulonephritis related to the infection. The renal biopsy showed areas of increased mesangial matrix and presence of thickening in the membranes of the glomerular capillaries. Direct immunofluorescence techniques showed granular mesangial IgA and C3 fixation, with a predominance of IgA deposits, and therefore compatible with infection-related IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis.  In view of these findings and the extrarenal manifestations characteristic of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, we requested an extension of the immunofluorescence of the skin biopsy, which also showed IgA deposits. All these findings were therefore compatible with IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis related to infective endocarditis due to SAMS with manifestations of Schönlein-Henoch purpura ("Schönlein-Henoch like"). Despite therapeutic measures, the patient had a torpid evolution with massive alveolar haemorrhage and no recovery of renal function, finally leading to exitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Unstable angina in 1999, implantation of two drug-eluting stents in the right coronary artery and circumflex artery. Aortic valve sclerosis. Single episode of self-limited atrial fibrillation during treatment with brentuximab for Hodgkin's lymphoma. It was decided not to anticoagulate due to the high haemorrhagic risk and because the paroxysm of atrial fibrillation was considered reactive to treatment. Follow-up in cardio-oncology consultations. Last check-up in December 2019, without angina. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm operated on in 2003, complicated by acute renal failure secondary to right renal ischaemia, with the need for haemofiltration in the postoperative period.

Haematological history: Hodgkin's lymphoma nodular sclerosis type, probable stage IV due to pulmonary involvement. Treatment within the BREPEM clinical trial (brentuximab with cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, prednisone and mitoxantrone), suspended due to toxicity (febrile neutropenia of abdominal focus and water overload). Subsequently two cycles of ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Remission with the exception of lung nodule DS 4, biopsied and without findings.

Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index at the upper limit of normality. Perihilar and peribronchovascular thickening and costophrenic sinus impingement, compatible with heart failure. White left lung (already present in previous cases). Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle, with slight concentric hypertrophy, hyperdynamic, with normal global systolic function, despite basal inferior akinesia and inferior septal akinesia. Transmitral filling pattern with single wave. Left atrium slightly dilated. Non-dilated right atrium. Right ventricle not dilated, hyperdynamic, with normal global systolic function.

Morphologically normal tricuspid valve with mild insufficiency. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 43 mmHg. Inferior vena cava not dilated with physiological inspiratory collapse. Slight circumferential pericardial effusion, with no evidence of haemodynamic compromise, with epicardial fat. Diagnostic coronary angiography: access via right radial artery, contrast 100 cc. Left main coronary artery (LMCA) atheromatous with significant lesion (70%) distal involving the bifurcation. Anterior descending artery (AD): of good development and calibre, with diffuse mild atheromatosis without significant lesions. Circumflex (Cx): well-developed and of good calibre, composed mainly of a main marginal branch with a permeable stent without lesions, vessel with diffuse mild atheromatosis, without significant lesions. Right coronary artery (RCA): dominant, chronic occlusion in its proximal segment; distal vessel of moderate calibre with no significant lesions due to collateral circulation. Therapeutic coronary angiography: access via the right femoral artery guided by ultrasound, contrast 227 cc.

Vascular closure with percutaneous closure device, checking correct common femoral puncture by fluoroscopy and persistence of flow by echo-Doppler.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION A 75-year-old man with the aforementioned history was admitted for an episode of angina at rest. He also presented with semiology of decompensated heart failure and rapid atrial fibrillation of uncertain onset. All this in the context of a possible relapse of the underlying haematological pathology, symptoms of respiratory infection and anaemisation with respect to baseline haemoglobin levels. ECG suggestive of TCI disease and elevation of markers of myocardial damage with ascending curve. Asymptomatic for chest pain when assessed by cardiology. Initially, two red blood cell concentrates were transfused, intravenous depletive treatment was started and, given the respiratory infection in an immunocompromised patient, empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started with piperacillin-tazobactam. Double antiplatelet therapy was also started with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel, initially without anticoagulation. Coronary angiography showed significant distal LMCA disease involving the bifurcation with LAD and Cx, in addition to chronic LMCA occlusion. As this was a highly complex patient, with significant comorbidity and high ischaemic and haemorrhagic risk, it was decided not to intervene until the case was presented to the heart team. Comorbidity included Hodgkin's lymphoma with suspected progression at present (probable stage IV due to pulmonary involvement in recent CT scan), although histological confirmation was pending. During admission, an assessment by haematology was requested, who estimated a poor medium-term prognosis. In addition, our patient had chronic multifactorial normocytic-normochromic anaemia (haematological disease, chronic disorders, chronic renal disease, chronic treatment with trimethoprim/cotrimoxazole) with usual Hb levels of 10 mg/dl, presenting on arrival with anaemisation up to Hb 8.1 mg/dl. Despite transfusion with stabilisation of Hb levels around baseline, negative balance, controlled ventricular response and titration of antianginal medical treatment, the patient persisted with minimal effort angina in the cardiology ward. The case was presented to the heart team, who decided to perform percutaneous revascularisation of the LMCA, given the high surgical risk. A new coronary angiography was performed via the right femoral artery with implantation of two drug-eluting stents in the LMCA-AD and LMCA-Cx using the DK-Crusch technique, without immediate complications and with resolution of angina. Following the PIONEER strategy, antithrombotic treatment was maintained with simple antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg/24 hours and anticoagulation with low-dose rivaroxaban (10 mg/24 hours adjusted to renal function). After discharge, the patient remains asymptomatic for angina and without haemorrhagic complications. However, pulmonary progression of Hodgkin's lymphoma was confirmed and he died one month after discharge.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocardial infarction without ST elevation, Killip II. Revascularisation of distal left main coronary artery with two drug-eluting stents. Chronic ischaemic heart disease with preserved LVEF. Coronary artery disease partially revascularised percutaneously, chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery. Persistent atrial fibrillation. Decompensation of heart failure secondary to previous events. Respiratory infection in immunosuppressed patient. Chronic multifactorial exacerbated anaemia. Stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma due to pulmonary involvement. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 24-year-old male, working in a hardware store, with no known drug allergies or toxic habits. No cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). Hypothyroidism on replacement therapy. In June 2008, he consulted for cough and progressive dyspnoea of 6 months' evolution, and was diagnosed by the pulmonology department as having sarcoidosis with grade II pulmonary involvement, with associated bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids was started. In September 2008 he was admitted for sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with haemodynamic instability. During admission, a dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction was observed. A haemodynamic study showed coronary arteries without stenosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a dilated left ventricle with a maximum telediastolic diameter of 60 mm, apical thinning with apical inferior, anterior and lateral akinesia, medial lateral, medial anterior hypokinesia and medial inferior hypokinesia, with severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 20%). Late subendocardial enhancement in basal inferior and basal lateral face, with extension to papillary muscles; and transmural in mid and apical lateral, mid and apical inferior, and apical anterior face. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation was performed in October 2008. He was admitted in December 2008 due to infection of the surgical wound of the ICD, the system was explanted and antibiotics were administered, despite which the infectious clinical symptoms persisted with febrile syndrome, and the studies were extended and tricuspid endocarditis was detected, complicated with pulmonary embolisms. With progressive deterioration of his functional status and refractory heart failure, associated with several episodes of non-sustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) with poor haemodynamic tolerance. On 9 February 2009, he suffered cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) due to primary ventricular fibrillation (VF), recovered after 2 shocks, with no sequelae. She was referred to the reference centre for evaluation for cardiac transplant, which was performed on 20/02/2009. During admission, he presented with complications such as avascular necrosis of both hips, probably related to corticosteroid treatment. Subsequently, in May 2011, he underwent bilateral hip replacement surgery. During the following years, he was admitted on multiple occasions for infectious complications (lung abscess in 2010, thoracic herpes zoster in 2010, repeated UTI, gastroenteritis). In January 2013 he presented with an episode of acute grade 3R rejection symptomatic for dizziness, dyspnoea on minimal exertion and complete atrioventricular block (AVB). After treatment with corticosteroid boluses, the condition was reversed, with disappearance of AVB and clinical improvement. In the control biopsy, the acute cellular rejection was in resolution. Prior to discharge, he presented an episode of atrial deflutter, treated with atrial overstimulation. A control biopsy was repeated 6 months later, with no evidence of rejection. He was admitted on 23/06/2013 for self-limited epigastric pain radiating to the back, associated with a feeling of breathlessness, lasting about 15 minutes, after walking for 10 minutes. Previously, the patient had been suffering from asthenia for a week, with no other associated cardiovascular symptoms. He denied any infectious symptoms or fever. He suffered an episode of alimentary vomiting in the emergency department. On physical examination, the patient had a good general appearance, was haemodynamically stable, with no congestive symptoms, and was eupneic at baseline. On cardiac auscultation, he was tachycardic, with no murmurs or friction rubs. Abdomen painful on palpation in the right hypochondrium, soft, depressible and with no evidence of peritoneal irritation.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus tachycardia at 135 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, ST rectification of V1-V4 and convex ST in inferior face. ECG: sinus tachycardia at 105 bpm, inferior ST elevation, ST depression of V1-V3, inferior-posterior Q wave. ECG: complete VAB spells in the context of myocardial ischaemia. CBC: blood count: leukocytes 13,600/μl (normal leukocyte formula), haemoglobin 13.7 g/dl, haematocrit 43.9%, platelets 206,000/μl. Coagulation: To. T. Partial Activated 29.9 s, INR 1.22, prothrombin rate 77%. Biochemistry: glucose 80 mg/dl, urea 58 mg/dl, creatinine 1.10 mg/dl, GFR 79 ml/min, sodium 142 mEq/l, potassium 4.6 mEq/l, chlorine 109 mEq/l, GOT(AST) 109 U/l, GPT (ALT) 58 U/l, amylase 35 U/l, total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dl. Serialisation of myocardial damage markers: ultrasensitive troponin 1919 ng/l - 1964 ng/l - 1990 ng/l [ 0 - 13]. Coronary angiography: three-vessel coronary artery disease, with poor distal beds and diffuse disease, with thrombotic occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). During percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), multiple dilatations with balloon angioplasty were attempted to recanalise the coronary artery, but no flow was achieved due to severe no reflow phenomenon.   CLINICAL COURSE The patient was admitted with initial suspicion of acute myocarditis versus acute coronary syndrome type NSTEMI, with flat enzyme mobilisation in the following 12 hours. The ECG on admission showed sinus tachycardia, with subtle changes in the repolarisation of ST rectification in V1-V4 and convex ST in the inferior face. At 21:00h on the day of admission, the patient began with dyspnoea, tachypnoea and vegetative symptoms. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with lower ST elevation, with self-limited spells of complete AVB, and an emergent haemodynamic study was performed. Catheterisation revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease, with poor distal beds and diffuse disease, with thrombotic occlusion of the proximal DC. During PCI, multiple dilatations with balloon angioplasty were attempted, but no flow was achieved due to no reflow. During the procedure the patient suffered complete AVB with severe haemodynamic deterioration Killip IV, which triggered ventricular fibrillation. Despite multiple shocks at 200J and advanced CPR for a prolonged period, the patient did not respond to these measures and died.  DIAGNOSIS Acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation (STEACS) lower Killip IV. Complete AVB due to myocardial ischaemia. CRP due to VF. Graft vascular disease in heart transplant patients. Proximal DC thrombotic occlusion. Death.  Previous: Sarcoidosis with pulmonary and cardiac involvement, on corticosteroid treatment. Infiltrative cardiomyopathy in dilated phase due to sarcoidosis, with severe systolic dysfunction, ACC/AHA stage D CHF. Multiple infectious complications probably related to immunosuppressive treatment. Acute tricuspid infective endocarditis. Cardiac transplant. Acute rejection resolved. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY 77-year-old woman, allergic to propifenazone, with a history of arterial hypertension for more than 20 years and dyslipidaemia, both under medical treatment with good control. No other cardiovascular risk factors.  Cardiological history Diagnosed with persistent atrial fibrillation in October 2011, with mild hypertensive heart disease (left ventricle [LV] of normal size, slightly hypertrophic, normal left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] with moderately dilated left atrium [LA] on transthoracic echocardiography [TTE]), which required pharmacological cardioversion in March 2012 and pulmonary vein ablation in October 2012. He initially remained in sinus rhythm under antiarrhythmic treatment with flecainide (50 mg, half a tablet every 12 hours), which was discontinued in October 2013, and anticoagulation with dabigatran (150 mg every 12 hours). He subsequently presented arrhythmic recurrence in the form of atrial fibrillation and left flutter in early June 2014, which required reablation of the left atrial substrate, atrial roof line and mitral isthmus. Recurrence of left flutter at the end of June 2014, which required new electrical cardioversion in the same month. On admission, antiarrhythmic treatment was started with a loading dose of intravenous amiodarone with facial flushing and discomfort, so the infusion was stopped and outpatient management with oral flecainide (100 mg, half a tablet every 12 hours) and atenolol (50 mg, one and a half tablets every 24 hours) was decided. She was reviewed in February 2015 for an episode of clumsiness in the right leg that temporarily coincided with arrhythmic recurrence in the form of atrial fibrillation. In view of this situation, a referral to neurology was requested and a diagnosis of transient ischaemic attack was made following a cranial MRI in which acute/subacute ischaemic lesions were ruled out. Since then, amiodarone 200 mg every 8 hours was started as a loading dose for a week and then 200 mg every 24 hours. Since then in sinus rhythm. In August 2015 antiacogulation is changed from dabigatran (150 mg every 12 hours) to rivaroxaban (15 mg, every 24 hours) due to worsening renal function. Other relevant background information On the other hand, in January 2016, there were episodes of copious and recurrent anterior epistaxis with significant anaemisation, despite the treatment applied by the otorhinolaryngology department (cauterisation with silver nitrate and placement of spogostan and bactroban film). In view of this situation, percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage was decided in February 2016 with a 28 mm Amulet device. Treatment was started with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg every 24 hours and anti-clotting agents were discontinued. In April 2016, double antiplatelet therapy was discontinued and single antiplatelet therapy was maintained with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg, every 24 hours).  Medical treatment Amiodarone 200 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg (1 tablet at lunch) and valsartan 50 mg (1 tablet at breakfast).  CURRENT ILLNESS Asymptomatic for dyspnoea, palpitations and chest pain until August 2018, at which time she attended the emergency department reporting progressive exertional dyspnoea and dry cough, which prevented her from carrying out her daily activities.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 150/90 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 65 bpm, SatO2 92%, temperature 37.5 ̊C. Acceptable general condition. Conscious and oriented in the three spheres.

Minimal mitral and aortic regurgitation. Minimal tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating a systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs) within the normal range. No signs of pericardial pathology. Vena cava of normal calibre collapsing with inspiration. Atrial appendage closure device. Chest computed tomography (CT) 08/18: pulmonary involvement characterised by areas of pulmonary consolidation with alveolar pattern and air bronchogram predominantly peripheral and in lower lobes, patchy foci of ground glass and small nodular opacities. It is associated with a peripheral coarse reticular interstitial pattern and traction bronchiectasis, suggestive of chronicity. Compatible with cryptogenic organised pneumonia. No pleural effusion is observed. Left atrial appendage closure device. Main trunk of pulmonary artery of 29 mm, at the high limit of normality. Multinodular goitre at the expense of the left lobe, partially endothoracic, with the largest nodule measuring 20 mm in the left thyroid lobe. Diffuse increased attenuation of the liver parenchyma (study without contrast). Bronchoscopy: normal. Bronchoalveolar lavage with predominantly neutrophilic phenotype, no microbiological isolates and pathological anatomy with fatty macrophages. Respiratory function tests 08/18: mild restrictive ventilatory abnormality. Severe decrease in diffusing capacity. 6 minute walk test 08/18: Respiratory function tests after corticosteroid treatment 09/18: normal respiratory function tests. Isolated moderate decrease in diffusing capacity. Improvement of 3 ml/mmHG/min in diffusing capacity compared to previous tests. 6-minute walk test after corticosteroid treatment 09/18: Chest CT scan 10/18: persistent peripheral pattern of predominance in bases, interstitial, ground glass and with thickening of interlobar septa, which shows a clear improvement compared to the August scan, with almost complete disappearance of the areas of consolidation. Nodular goitre predominantly on the left with some endothoracic component. Left atrial closure device. Dilatation of the left atrium. No pleural or pericardial effusion was observed.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In view of the elevated inflammatory parameters and the radiological pulmonary alterations (areas of bibasal consolidation and bilateral pleural effusion), it was decided to admit the patient to the cardiology ward for aetiological study and treatment. Due to increased inflammatory parameters, it was decided to administer intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1,000 mg every 8 hours and oral azithromycin 500 mg every 24 hours for three days. In addition, despite no clinical signs of systemic congestion, given the mildly elevated pro-BNP and the possible association of incipient heart failure in the context of primary pulmonary pathology, intravenous furosemide was added as part of the initial treatment. Amiodarone was also suspended due to suspicion of pulmonary toxicity until the aetiology of the pulmonary involvement and its evolution were known. During the first 48 hours, there was no improvement in her clinical condition, and a thoracic CT scan was completed, which showed a pulmonary pattern compatible with cryptogenic organised pneumonia with fibrotic changes of chronic profile. The patient was assessed by pulmonology during admission and studies of interstitial lung disease were completed. Respiratory function tests showed a mild restrictive ventilatory abnormality, and a severe decrease in diffusing capacity, with a 6-minute walk test with desaturation of up to 83-84% over a maximum distance covered of 390m. They also performed a bronchoscopy which revealed no pathological findings, with bronchoalveolar lavage showing a predominantly neutrophilic phenotype, no microbiological isolates and pathological anatomy with fatty macrophages. With the diagnosis of cryptogenic organised pneumonia probably related to amiodarone (suspended on admission), corticosteroid treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg/24 hours) was started during admission. Prior to discharge, a thyroid ultrasound was requested, which showed multiple benign nodules with normal thyroid function. She was discharged after 7 days of admission, with partial improvement of her respiratory symptoms with outpatient steroid treatment (oral methylprednisolone, 40 mg until further review in one month). The rest of the treatment at discharge was as follows: pantoprazole 40 mg at breakfast, acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg at lunch, valsartan 80 mg at dinner and calcium and vitamin D3 1250 mg at breakfast. She came for a check-up at the end of September 2018, reporting a clear improvement in respiratory function. Complete respiratory function tests were repeated, showing an improvement in respiratory function (normal function, with an improvement in diffusion capacity of 3 ml/mmHg with respect to the previous test) and in the 6-minute walk test in which she was able to complete 445 metres. A chest CT scan was performed in October 2018 in which a peripheral interstitial pattern persisted, predominantly basal, in ground glass, with thickening of the interlobar septa, although with a clear improvement compared to the previous CT scan, with almost complete disappearance of the areas of consolidation.  DIAGNOSIS Interstitial pneumonitis probably secondary to pharmacological toxicity due to amiodarone. Hypertensive heart disease with normal ventricular function, without signs of heart failure. Systemic arterial hypertension with good pharmacological control. Persistent atrial fibrillation treated by ablation in 2012 and 2014. Arrhythmic recurrence with low afterload. Currently in sinus rhythm. History of recurrent epistaxis under treatment with oral anticoagulation. Carrier of Amulet 28 mm atrial appendage closure device and on treatment with simple antiplatelet therapy. Benign thyroid nodules without alterations in thyroid function. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Electrocardiogram (ECG) during admission: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm, first degree atrioventricular block (PR 245 ms), intraventricular conduction disturbance (QRS 105 ms). Posteroinferior hemiblock. Image of pseudoinfarction in the anterior face. QTc 461 ms. Transthoracic echocardiography: end-diastolic volume 132 ml, end-systolic volume 86 ml. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 35% by Simpson biplane. Left ventricle not dilated, severely hypertrophied, with moderately depressed global systolic function. Generalised hypokinesia, without segmental alterations. Septal hyperrefringence. Restrictive filling pattern. Mild mitral insufficiency of central origin, without notable alterations in the aortic valve. Dilated left atrium (48 mm in M mode). End-diastolic velocity of pulmonary insufficiency 17 mmHg, allowing calculation of a diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 27 mmHg. Slightly dilated right ventricle without hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. Right atrium not dilated. No tricuspid insufficiency. Pericardium with posterior effusion of 5 mm. Inferior vena cava 21 mm, with respiratory collapse greater than 50%. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): right atrium 63 x 54 mm. Right ventricle (RV) 94 x 51 x 69 mm. Left atrium 69 x 56 mm. Left Ventricle (LV) 48 x 49 x 93 mm. Interatrial Septum 8 mm. Minimal circumferential pericardial fluid tab. LVEF 35%. Beat volume 33.4 ml/m2, cardiac output 5.1 l/min; end-diastolic volume (EDV) 96.6 ml/m2, end-systolic volume (ESV) 63.2 ml/m2. LV wall mass 155.6 g/m2. RV ejection fraction 27%; LV stroke volume 57.2 ml/m2; cardiac output 4.3 l/min; end-diastolic volume 106.1 ml/m2, end-systolic volume 77.5 ml/m2. LV with moderate-severe concentric hypertrophy, predominantly septal hypertrophy, with wall thickness in IVS up to 23 mm, anterolateral segment 18 mm and inferior segment 15 mm at baseline. Global generalised hypocontractility, more accentuated at the basal level of the RV with hypertrophy up to 6-7 mm thick. After intravenous contrast administration, diffuse global subendocardial pathological enhancement is observed, as well as transmural enhancement in septobasal. T1 values: mid-level levels of 1194 ± 103 ms in the lateral aspect showing some focal areas within the lateral aspect levels of up to 1224 ± 85 ms, ECV 48.1% in the lateral aspect and up to 54.7% in focal areas of the lateral aspect. Pyrophosphate scintigraphy: increased uptake of the radiotracer at cardiac level, more intense than in bone structures, compatible with transthyretin amyloidosis (Perugini grade 3). Genetic test: negative result for genetic variants related to cardiac amyloidosis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the pulmonology department with suspected acute COPD. During his admission he did not present complete symptomatic resolution and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan was requested to assess the progression of his disease. This test showed the presence of pericardial effusion and signs of heart failure, so transthoracic echocardiography was performed. After finding an echocardiographic pattern suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis, the patient was transferred to the cardiology department. Cardio-MRI was requested, which again showed a pattern compatible with cardiac amyloidosis. In addition, a fat biopsy was requested (the patient refused a rectal biopsy), which was negative, a 48-hour Holter recording with no alterations, a proteinogram and detection of light chains in serum and urine, which was negative, and a scintigraphy with technetium-99-diphosphonate (Tc99-DPN) with intense uptake. With these results (see section on complementary tests) the patient was diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin. A genetic study was performed which did not detect any pathogenic variants and the diagnosis was therefore made as senile or wild-type. The patient was discharged with furosemide 80 mg every 24 hours and bisoprolol 2.5 mg every 12 hours, in addition to his usual treatment. Spironolactone and renin-angiotensin axis antagonists could not be added due to impaired renal function and hyperkalaemia. At the outpatient level, the patient was in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III. Treatment of systolic dysfunction was optimised by adding low doses of sacubitril/valsartan, as the patient reported no evidence of orthostatic hypotension or other manifestations of dysautonomia. On subsequent examinations, renal function remained stable, as well as blood pressure and potassium levels, so he was maintained on sacubitrile/valsartan 24/26 m /12 hours. He did not present orthostatic hypotension and finally low doses of eplerenone every 48 hours could be added to the treatment. The patient reported relative clinical improvement, as well as a decrease in NT-proBNP levels from 11,562 pg/ml to 6,244 pg/ml. The same treatment was continued and to date the patient has not been admitted to hospital.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure with depressed LVEF. Cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin, senile form. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Glucose 101 mg/dl, ALT 42 U/l, GGT 19 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 76 U/l, bilirubin 0.3 mg/dl, albumin 3.8 g/dl, creatinine 0.97 mg/dl, sodium 141 mmol/l, potassium 3.7 mmol/l, C-reactive protein 0.4 mg/dl, CK 67 U/l, ultrasensitive troponin I 11 ng/l (VN < 21 ng/l), NT-proBNP 149 ng/l. Anti-striated muscle antibodies (immunofluorescence): positive.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival, and given the suspected diagnosis, empirical treatment was started with high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day), oral diuretic at medium doses and telemetry monitoring. During admission, there was a progressive normalisation of electrocardiographic alterations and markers of myocardial damage, as well as an evident parallel clinical improvement, tolerating a subsequent tapering regimen of systemic corticosteroids. Transthoracic echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging showed preserved biventricular function, without valvular heart disease or late enhancement. Diffuse oedema predominantly mediodistal on T2-STIR sequences compatible with a myocarditis-type inflammatory process with no apparent sequelae. In addition, the positive result of anti-striated muscle antibodies and triceps brachii biopsy were consistent with the diagnosis of myositis. It is worth mentioning that neither coronary angiography nor endomyocardial biopsy was necessary in this case since the clinical, analytical and ECG alterations, completely reversible with anti-inflammatory drugs, together with the autoimmunity, the muscle biopsy and the data from the T2-STIR sequences and maps are sufficiently important to establish the diagnosis of myocarditis due to immunotherapy (nivolumab). Months later, she is still under outpatient follow-up in cardio-oncology outpatient clinics, asymptomatic, with normal ECG and troponins. Nivolumab, suspended after admission, has not been restarted.  DIAGNOSIS Myocarditis and myositis due to nivolumab. Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. Essential arterial hypertension.

A 71-year-old male patient with a history of prostatectomy for Gleason 7 prostate adenocarcinoma (2 years ago), not carrying a Foley catheter and who was regularly monitored by the Urology Department after the operation. One year ago, he underwent cystoscopy for recurrent UTIs and underwent surgical dilatation for vesicourethral stenosis. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation due to severe aortic insufficiency caused by a bicuspid valve, and a valve prosthesis was fitted. Three months after the surgery, he came to the emergency department complaining of arthralgia, fever and new onset postvoid drip. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly and initial laboratory tests showed CRP: 26.9 mg/dL (reference values: 0-8 mg/dL), abundant bacteria and pyuria in the urinary sediment. Abdominal CT scan showed splenic infarction and biochemistry was expanded with troponin T: 319.6 ng/L (reference values: 0-14 ng/L), and pro-BNP: 45,140 pg/mL (reference values: 0-100 pg/mL). Microbiological study of urine in CLED culture medium showed no growth and Gram staining of urine identified gram-positive cocci. A blood agar culture was performed and gram-positive cocci colony growth was observed. Identification to genus and species level, Aerococcus urinae, was performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In the 4 bottles of the two blood cultures there was also growth and the same micro-organism was identified. The antibiogram was as follows: sensitive to penicillin (MIC = 0.012 mg/L), cefotaxime (MIC = 0.064 mg/L), levofloxacin (MIC = 0.25 mg/L), vancomycin and linezolid. Transesophageal echocardiography showed evidence of prosthetic valve with perivalvular abscess. The patient initially received cloxacillin + gentamicin and later continued with ceftriaxone + daptomycin, with subsequent negative blood cultures. However, the clinical evolution, inflammatory markers and myocardial function were compatible with sepsis and acute pulmonary oedema, with fatal evolution towards irreversible ventricular failure. He finally died due to a rupture of the aortic annulus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY No allergic drug reactions. No hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Dyslipidaemia. Ex-smoker for more than 20 years. No alcoholism. Obesity. Cardiological history: not reported. Other history: Last admission to neurology (one year ago): cortical cerebral venous thrombosis with associated parietal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Negative thrombophilia study. ANA Positive 1/160, no apparent autoimmune symptoms. G3 P3 C0 A0. Hypermenorrhoea due to uterine myoma. Previous surgical interventions: cholecystectomy 20 years ago. Usual treatment: atorvastatin 20 mg (0-0-1), citicoline 1g (1-0-0). On treatment with acenocoumarol until 10 days before the current event. As there were no pathological findings requiring indefinite maintenance of anticoagulation, anticoagulation treatment was discontinued.  CURRENT DISEASE A 44-year-old woman came to the emergency department with oppressive chest pain of 24 hours' duration. She reported moderate intensity epigastralgia with subsequent irradiation to the central thoracic region and neck associated with vegetative cramping, which did not subside after taking several tablets of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. No dyspnoea or presyncope. She denied previous episodes of chest pain. Given the persistence of the pain, she decided to go to the emergency department. On arrival, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed showing a subepicardial lesion current in the inferolateral and anterior face (V3-V6 and II, III and aVF). A haemodynamic alert was activated and emergent catheterisation was performed via the left radial route according to the usual technique with a 6F introducer. Right dominance. Evidence of thrombosis at the level of the ostial anterior descending (AD) artery. Thromboaspiration was performed with extraction of scarce white thrombus but recovering distal flow TIMI 2-3. The lesion was predilated with a balloon, a drug-eluting stent was implanted and the proximal segment of the stent was post-dilated with a balloon with good results. However, there was later evidence of TIMI 1 distal mid-distal LAD flow that did not improve despite multiple doses of intracoronary nitroglycerin (icNTG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) balloon/guidewire manipulation (no-reflow effect). Periprocedural complications included ventricular fibrillation with haemodynamic instability requiring electrical cardioversion and vasoactive support. Given the patient's history of cavernous sinus thrombosis and subsequent subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), it was decided not to administer potent antiplatelet therapy or abciximab, so acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 250 mg and clopidogrel 600 mg were administered. After transfer to the coronary unit, a portable transthoracic echocardiography showed severe ventricular dysfunction and an image suggestive of apical thrombus. Given the suspicion of apical thrombus, enoxaparin is maintained at anticoagulant doses. Two hours after the percutaneous procedure, the pain recurred and a new ST-segment elevation was observed, so it was decided to activate a second haemodynamic alert. Emergent coronary angiography was performed. Acute thrombosis of the stent in the LAD was evidenced and balloon predilatation was performed, restoring TIMI 3 flow with good expansion of the stent, with no images of dissection of the distal edge of the stent; however, there was still a large mobile thrombotic cast. Tirofiban is administered. After several minutes the thrombotic component persists with TIMI 3 flow, so thromboaspiration is performed with a good final angiographic result. He was transferred to the coronary unit.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 90/50 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 120 bpm, SatO2 97% with Ventimask with FiO2 50%.

Aorta and great vessels of normal diameter and morphology. Atria of normal dimensions. Perfusion study (video 10): Gadoteric acid (0.15 mm/kg) is administered and well tolerated by the patient. Resting perfusion defects are detected in the akinetic segments. Necrosis and viability detection study: presence of myocardial LGE suggestive of transmural necrosis at the anterior and anteroseptal basal and mid and anterior and apical septal level and strict apex with presence of microvascular obstruction in these segments (absence of viability in 7 segments out of 17, DA-dependent). Presence of minimal pericardial and pleural effusion. Conclusion: acute ischaemic LV heart disease with preserved volumes and severe depression of GSF (LVEF 33%) with contractile alteration, oedema, perfusion defect and transmural necrosis with MVO at the level of 7 proximal LAD-dependent segments. Absence of intraventricular thrombus. Total Body CT: Thoracic CT: centred mediastinum with no evidence of ganglionic formations of significant size. No pulmonary nodules or condensations are observed. No pleural or pericardial effusion is observed. Abdominopelvic CT scan: heterogeneous uterus, enlarged probably due to the presence of myomas. Nodular image of 17 mm with peripheral contrast uptake in left dense topography theoretically suggestive of corpus luteum. Liver of normal size and morphology with no evidence of focal lesions or dilatation of the intra- or extrahepatic bile duct. Cholecystectomy. Spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and both kidneys were normal. No lymph node formations of significant size were observed in the abdominopelvic chains. Normal calibre and distribution of intestinal loops. No signs of metastatic bone involvement were observed by this technique.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After readmission to the coronary unit, he presented haemodynamic lability requiring increased vasoactive support with noradrenaline and dobutamine, so it was decided to implant an intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation device. Progressive weaning of haemodynamic support was achieved, with withdrawal of balloon counterpulsation and dobutamine on the third day. On the fourth day, despite noradrenaline support, levosimendan was started due to sustained hypotension. Norepinephrine was withdrawn on the sixth day. No ventricular arrhythmias were observed on monitoring. Spontaneous diuresis greater than 1500 ml per day with accumulated negative balance. An MRI was performed which confirmed severe ventricular dysfunction and ruled out the presence of intracavitary thrombus. Discharge to the cardiology ward was decided to continue the study. During his stay on the ward he remained stable from the cardiovascular point of view, with no new episodes of chest pain. He began to ambulate with dyspnoea on moderate exertion (NYHA III/IV) with no other signs of heart failure; he also reported no palpitations, syncopal or presyncopal episodes. Pharmacological titration was carried out, verifying progressive tolerance (bisoprolol 5 mg/12h, enalapril 2.5 mg/12h, eplerenone 50 mg/24h, ivabradine 10 mg/12h). Given that the patient had presented two thromboembolic events in different vascular territories, the last of which coincided with withdrawal of acenocoumarol, it was decided to perform a complete thrombophilia study. A CT scan of the abdomen and abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out tumours and a complete blood analysis was performed. No relevant findings were observed in any of them. The patient was discharged home with follow-up in the heart failure unit with the following treatment regimen: Enoxaparin 80 mg one subcutaneous injection at breakfast and dinner, as a bridge to acenocoumarol. acenocoumarol 1 mg two tablets at lunch. ASA 100 mg one tablet at breakfast. Ticagrelol 90 mg one tablet at breakfast and dinner. Atorvastatin 40 mg one tablet at dinner. Bisoprolol 5 mg one tablet at breakfast and dinner. Ivabradine 5 mg one tablet at breakfast and dinner. Eplerenone 50 mg one tablet at lunch. Enalapril 2.5 mg one tablet at dinner. Furosemide 40 mg one tablet at breakfast. Omeprazole 20 mg one tablet at breakfast.  DIAGNOSIS KILLIP IV STEMI: acute thrombotic occlusion of the ostial LAD. Primary angioplasty with DES implantation in complicated LAD with no-reflow phenomenon and subsequent acute stent thrombosis.   Secondary diagnoses: Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction. Apical aneurysm. Dyslipidaemia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Electrocardiogram at discharge: atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 80 bpm. Q wave in III. Low voltages.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Initial cardiological assessment in the emergency department revealed clinical signs of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at 132 bpm and left systolic dysfunction on echocardioscopy, and the patient was admitted for appropriate treatment and to complete aetiological studies. The patient showed significant clinical improvement during the first days of admission with depletive treatment with intravenous diuretics, reaching a dry weight of 156 kg compared to the initial 171 kg. A regulated echocardiogram was performed with echocontrast due to a poor echocardiographic window, which confirmed the echocardiographic findings, also showing elevated filling pressures with significant pulmonary hypertension and associated right-sided dysfunction. Furthermore, the aetiological study was completed with coronary angiography to rule out ischaemic aetiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, showing no angiographically significant lesions in the epicardial coronary arteries. Therefore, the condition was interpreted as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the context of non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy, without being able to rule out a toxic origin (enolic) together with a certain component of associated tachycardiomyopathy. During admission, treatments with prognostic value in heart failure with depressed systolic function were successfully initiated, with good tolerance to them, achieving good heart rate control with beta-blockers at medium doses and being discharged with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and antialdosteronics at maximum doses tolerated by blood pressure. In addition, during his hospitalisation the patient received nutritional education for changes in eating habits, as well as instructions to begin physical exercise. In the case of a patient with pre-diabetes and morbid obesity with LDL 150 mg/dl, statins were started to achieve target LDL < 100 mg/dl. In collaboration with the pulmonology department, CPAP treatment was started during admission for his sleep apnoea, with good tolerance. Regarding his atrial fibrillation of uncertain onset, with a CHADS-VASc score of 2 and HASBLED of 0, he was anticoagulated on admission with weight-adjusted LMWH. An initial strategy of rate control was proposed so that, after clinical stabilisation and one month of anticoagulation, programmed electrical cardioversion was performed for rhythm control purposes. Regarding the choice of anticoagulation therapy at discharge, the patient refused to take VKA for personal reasons, which added to his high weight and BMI posed a major dilemma. In agreement with the haematology service, it was decided to start rivaroxaban 20 mg and laboratory measurements of his peak and trough levels were performed to check that they were in therapeutic range. After this, he was discharged with this treatment on a continuous basis. In the outpatient follow-up, the patient has improved clinically, has reduced his weight to 130 kg (BMI 43 kg/m2) and is in functional grade II. Titration of prognostic drugs in heart failure has continued, replacing ACE inhibitors with sacubitrilo-valsartan. Two unsuccessful attempts at electrical cardioversion were made, opting to continue with heart rate control, which was proving adequate. In the control echocardiography after 3 months of optimised medical treatment, an improvement in LVEF of up to 50% was observed.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (possible toxic damage due to enolism and associated tachycardiomyopathy). Atrial fibrillation (AF) of undetermined onset (CHADSVASc 2, HASBLED 0). Coronary arteries without significant lesions. Very severe sleep apnoea syndrome. Morbid obesity. Arterial hypertension with good control at discharge. Prediabetes. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 37-year-old male of Indian origin with no cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The patient made his debut at the age of 16 years (in 1990) with syncope while playing football. He had no family history of sudden death or relevant diseases. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with negative T waves in the precordial leads and pre-excitation. Severe concentric ventricular hypertrophy was corroborated on echocardiography, with a maximum IVS diameter of 22 mm, diastolic dysfunction and mild biventricular systolic dysfunction. He subsequently presented with an episode of pre-excited atrial fibrillation (AF) at more than 200 bpm, and electrophysiological studies demonstrated the existence of a posteroseptal/medioseptal accessory pathway (near the normal conduction system) that could not be ablated by radiofrequency after three unsuccessful attempts in three different procedures, so he was managed with medical treatment. In 2012 (aged 27 years) he presented with an episode of acute pain in the right lower limb, being diagnosed by angio-CT of an acute thrombosis in the femoral artery, presumably due to an embolism secondary to a paroxysm of AF, so treatment with warfarin was started. To better define the myocardium, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed and showed severe biventricular hypertrophy with a maximum IVS thickness of up to 30 mm; slightly depressed LVEF and extensive diffuse fibrosis in the areas of hypertrophy. Several 24-hour Holter recordings were performed during the evolution without detecting ventricular tachycardias or frequent ventricular extrasystoles or new episodes of AF, although the patient reported palpitations about twice a month. On arrival at our centre, to which he was referred as a referral unit for cardiomyopathies and other familial heart diseases, the patient had blood pressure (BP) 136/89 mmHg, RS at 52 bpm, without jugular venous engorgement. On auscultation, cardiac tones were rhythmic without murmurs, with preserved vesicular murmur and no pathological sounds. The lower limbs showed no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. There were no skin lesions suggestive of cardio-cutaneous syndromes such as Fabry or Leopard.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus bradycardia at 47 bpm. PR 140 ms with positive delta wave in V1 suggestive of left accessory pathway. QRS 160 ms. Left axis. Elevated R wave voltages especially in left precordial and deep negative T waves from V1 to V6, in I and aVL and flattened in inferior face. ECG in pre-excited AF: irregular wide QRS tachycardia at more than 200 bpm, with irregularity in QRS morphology and width and in RR. First transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): concentric hypertrophy of 22 mm and midcavitary obliteration. Severe diastolic dysfunction. Dilated left atrium (LA). LVEF 57%. Moderate right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. CMR: short axis and 4 chambers showing severe biventricular hypertrophy. 3C, D and E: sagittal plane, 4 chambers and short axis late gadolinium enhancement showing extensive and diffuse uptake in areas of hypertrophy. First 24-hour Holter: sinus rhythm at 45-87 bpm. No significant pauses. Low density ventricular extrasystoles. Frequent atrial extrasystoles. Absence of ventricular arrhythmias or AF. No symptoms reported in the diary. First electrophysiological study (EPS): the posteroseptal/medioseptal accessory pathway was identified and radiofrequency ablation was attempted. The procedure was performed in two phases, but neither operator was able to achieve even transient block of the accessory pathway. Ergometry: Bruce protocol. The test was stopped after 6 minutes due to fatigue, having reached 53% of maximum heart rate (HR). Normal blood pressure response. No arrhythmias, repolarisation disturbances or chest pain. Last TTE: dilated left ventricle (LV), concentric hypertrophy more striking in the septum with apical and lateral hypertrabeculation, severe systolic dysfunction (Simpson biplane 10-15%). Mild-moderate mitral insufficiency (MI), biauricular dilatation, severely dilated RV with poor systolic function, moderate tricuspid insufficiency (TI), estimated pulmonary systolic pressure 51-56 mmHg.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION At the first assessment in our centre (2013), an ECG was performed which showed the previously described findings and a new echocardiogram, where in addition to severe hypertrophy, biauricular dilatation, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction with signs of increased filling pressures were observed. An exercise stress test was performed and stopped after 6 minutes due to pain in MID, having reached 53% of target HR, with normal blood pressure response, no chest pain and no repolarisation abnormalities. Due to the atypical presentation of the clinical picture, with severe concentric biventricular hypertrophy, diffuse late enhancement, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, onset of AF at an early age and presence of pre-excitation, the differential diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was made due to pathogenic variants in the sarcomeric genes with other possible aetiologies. A genetic study was performed in which a pathogenic variant in PRKAG2 was found. In 2015 he was admitted again for asthenia and general malaise, and severe sinus bradycardia with complete paroxysmal AVB was detected. Due to the need for pacing and the high risk of sudden death (severe biventricular hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction, dilated LA, non-ablatable accessory pathway with antegrade conduction at more than 200 bpm, a confirmed episode of pre-excited AF and cardiogenic syncope), it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). During the evolution, diastolic and systolic dysfunction progressed to become severe despite optimal medical treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), antialdosterone and beta-blockers, and the patient, aged 40 years, is currently in a pre-transplant cardiac situation.  DIAGNOSIS Severe biventricular hypertrophy. Pathogenic variant in PRKAG2. Extensive myocardial fibrosis in CMR. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by left posteromedial accessory pathway. Episode of pre-excited AF. Cardiogenic syncope of unfiliated aetiology: pre-excited AF vs VT. Progressive biventricular systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction. Embolism in right femoral artery possibly secondary to AF paroxysm. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY 41-year-old woman. No drug allergies. Medical history: migraines. Early menopause at the age of 37, no other known illnesses. Abortion at the age of 21. No family history of heart disease. Active smoking. When asked about other toxic habits, she did not mention them.  CURRENT ILLNESS On 10/02/2019 she was referred to the hospital emergency room from her health centre, accompanied by her brother, for presenting progressive dyspnoea of one month's evolution until becoming minimal effort accompanied by cough and orthopnoea on two pillows in the last 3 days. Cough without productive expectoration, on one occasion with haematic strands. There was no concomitant infectious semiology. In the last three days he also reported central thoracic discomfort on exertion and deep inspiration.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 140/95 mmHg. Conscious and oriented, slightly tachypnoeic at rest (24 breaths per minute). Jugular venous pulse elevated. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones at 105 bpm with audible third sound. Pulmonary auscultation: semiology of bilateral pleural effusion, more marked on the left. No oedema in the extremities or decubitus. The on-call cardiology department was contacted at that time. We performed portable echocardioscopy: we observed dilated left ventricle with systolic dysfunction at the expense of global hypocontractility, mitral valve with dilation of the mitral annulus and functional central insufficiency that appears to be of moderate degree and bilateral pleural effusion. It was decided to admit the patient to the cardiology ward as the first episode of heart failure in a patient with no personal cardiological history and, a priori, without a definite aetiology, in order to study the systolic dysfunction and decompensation. On arrival at the ward and once the patient was in the room, her brother approached us to tell us something important that the patient had been hiding from us: it turns out that our patient, although she had previously denied it, is a regular user of amphetamines.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm with negative T waves in V2-V6 and inferior face. Blood tests: Biochemistry: glucose 96 mg/dl, urea 0.37 g/l, creatinine 1.06 mg/dl, troponin Tus 41.73 ng/l, sodium 142 mEq/l, potassium 4.67 mEq/l, NT-proBNP 5993 pg/ml. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.43, pO2 104mmHg, pCO2 32mmHg, sPO 298.2%, CO3H 21.4mmol/l. Blood count: Hb 11.8 g/dl, Hct 34.6%, leukocytes 8l3 mil/mm3 with 55% neutrophils, platelets 172 mil/mm3. Coagulation: no alterations, fibrinogen 378 mg/dl. Urine toxicity: positive for amphetamines. Chest X-ray: signs of interstitial oedema together with cardiomegaly, left costophrenic sinus impingement. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) dilated and hypertrabeculated at apical level with moderate dysfunction (Simpson biplane 33%) at the expense of global hypocontractility. Increased filling pressures (mean E/e" 17 cm/sec). Left atrial dilatation (volume 94 ml) with atrial septal aneurysm without shunt. Mild functional mitral insufficiency. Right ventricle (RV) equally hypertrabeculated with normal size and contractility. Dilated IVC. Normal pericardium. Coronary angiography: left dominance. Non-significant stenosis in the first obtuse marginal. Rest of the coronary tree without angiographic lesions. Cardiac MRI: severely dilated LV (LVEDV 240 ml, LVESV 144 ml) hypertrabeculated at apical and lateral level, with discrete improvement of ventricular function (LVEF 40%) with global hypokinesia and akinesia at mid inferolateral, apical and mid inferior septal level. RV of normal size, hypertrabeculated at the free wall level and with RVEF 67%. There was also evidence of a small apical thrombus (6 x 9 mm). In the T1-weighted sequences, two foci of subendocardial enhancement are observed at the mid and apical inferolateral level and mid and apical septo-inferior septal level.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient had a very good response to depletive treatment with improvement of the congestive signs. Treatment was started for heart failure with systolic dysfunction using beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and antialdosterone. The study was completed with a regular echocardiogram and coronary angiography. The diuretic dose was titrated during admission and the patient was discharged a few days later with functional class I, maintaining treatment of the systolic dysfunction. Cardiac MRI was performed on an outpatient basis once the patient was discharged one month after the echocardiogram. After hospital discharge, the patient has ceased the consumption of toxic substances, remains in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I-II, and has not presented new episodes of decompensation.  DIAGNOSIS Acute congestive heart failure, first episode of decompensation. Dilated cardiomyopathy with moderate systolic dysfunction secondary to chronic amphetamine use. Ejection fraction slightly recovered at follow-up. Amphetamine abuse. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Peak myocardial damage markers: CK 316 U/l (CK MB40), TnUS 332 ng/dl. Hb1AC 6.8%. Total cholesterol 143 g/dl, HDL 41 mg/dl, Triglycerides 76 mg/dl. Coagulation: INR 1.06; prothrombin rate 91%. proBNP on admission: 17680 pg/ml. Transthoracic echocardiogram: dilated left ventricle (DTd 61 mm), with postero-basal and infero-basal akinesia. LVEF calculated by Simpson biplane of 35%. Right ventricular dysfunction (TAPSE 11 mm). Severe mitral insufficiency by Carpentier mechanism IIIb. Mild tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension at rest (50 mmHg). Transesophageal echocardiogram: mitral valve with calcification of the annulus, fibrosis of the leaflets with restriction of movement of the posterior leaflet leading to severe regurgitation. Posterior leaflet 10-11mm. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular dysfunction. Left atrial appendage free of thrombus. Haemodynamic study: three-vessel coronary artery disease. Right dominance. Coronary anomaly consisting of origin of all the coronary arteries in the right sinus of Valsalva, with independent ostium. Severe stenosis of the middle anterior descending artery (ADA), severe stenosis in the first obtuse marginal (OM1) and occlusion of chronic appearance in the distal right coronary artery (RCA), whose distal vessel is filled by heterocoronary circulation. Ventriculography: severely dilated left ventricle (LV), with severe depression of LVEF (31%) at the expense of inferior and posterolateral akinesia and hypokinesia of the remaining segments. Angioplasty: the OM1 lesion was predilated and a 2.75 x 15 mm drug-eluting stent was implanted to cover the lesion with good angiographic results. The middle LAD lesion is then predilated with a balloon and a 2.25 x 38 mm drug-eluting stent is implanted with a good final angiographic result.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was found to have acute pulmonary oedema and was admitted to the coronary unit, where ventilatory support was started with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and diuretic and vasodilator treatment with a good response, achieving stabilisation of the clinical picture within a few hours. An echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation due to restriction of posterior leaflet mobility (mechanism IIIb of Carpentier's classification). Subsequently, a haemodynamic study was performed which revealed a coronary anomaly consisting of the origin of the left coronary tree in the right sinus of Valsalva and severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. After discussing the case with the cardiac surgery department of our centre, percutaneous revascularisation of OM1 and ADA was decided, with subsequent re-evaluation of mitral insufficiency (MI).  After percutaneous revascularisation, the patient showed good clinical evolution, although the heart failure data persisted despite diuretic treatment, so after discussing the therapeutic alternatives with the heart team and in agreement with the patient, percutaneous treatment of her mitral valve pathology was decided using a MitraClip device; this procedure was successfully performed one month after hospital discharge, with a single clip implanted in the mitral position, guided by fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography, with a reduction in regurgitation from grade 4+ to 1+, with no post-implant residual mitral stenosis. After the procedure, the patient had a good clinical evolution and was discharged two days after the procedure.  DIAGNOSIS Dilated cardiomyopathy of ischaemic aetiology with moderate left ventricular dysfunction (35%). Old inferior myocardial infarction. Coronary anomaly (origin of all coronary arteries in the right sinus of Valsalva, with independent ostium). Severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. Partial percutaneous revascularisation (anterior descending [AD] and circumflex [Cx]). Severe mitral regurgitation by Carpentier mechanism IIIb. Percutaneous mitral repair by MitraClip device successful and without complications. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PERSONAL HISTORY Toxic habits: smoker of 1 cigarette/day. No cardiovascular risk factors. Anxiety-depressive syndrome. Usual treatment: fluoxetine 20 mg. CURRENT ILLNESS A 54-year-old man consulted for chest pain of 8 hours' duration, oppressive, radiating to the left upper limb and jaw. Although the pain started in the early hours of the morning, the patient did not consult his primary care centre until late in the morning. He reported similar symptoms in the previous days, with similar episodes of chest pain that were self-limiting within the first 10 minutes. She denies intercurrent infectious clinical manifestations. No other symptoms. On arrival at the primary care centre, an electrocardiogram was performed showing sinus rhythm at 85 bpm with ST-segment elevation in inferior leads. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 300 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg were administered and the Infarction Code was activated. On arrival at our centre, the patient was found to be sweaty, in fair general condition, with persistent chest pain and the electrocardiographic abnormalities described.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 140/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 85 bpm, Sat 95% baseline. General condition was fair. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur with no added noises. The rest of the examination was of no interest.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 90 bpm. PR 200 msg. Narrow QRS. Normal axis. ST segment elevation II, III, aVF, V5 and V6. Chest X-ray: CTI at the limit of normality. No pleural effusion. No radiological congestive data. Analysis on arrival: haemoglobin 12.4 g/dl. Leukocytes 10.82 Miles/mm3. Urea 49.0 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.85 mg/dl. Sodium 135 mEq/l. Potassium 3.8 mEq/l. Total bilirubin 0.64 mg/dl. GOT/AST 63 U/l. GPT/ALT 134 U/l. GGT 503 U/l. LDH 702 U/l. Alkaline phosphatase 214 U/l. CK 259 U/l. Troponin T (high sensitivity) 2790.00 ng/l. Coronary angiography: thrombotic occlusion of the circumflex artery (ACx), immediately distal to an aneurysmal segment. The thrombotic lesion was crossed with an angioplasty guidewire, partially recovering distal flow, visualising an intraluminal contrast defect compatible with a large amount of intracoronary thrombus. For this reason it was decided to perform thromboaspiration; abundant red thrombus was removed, thus recovering distal TIMI 3 flow. A marginal branch remained occluded despite repeated attempts at thromboaspiration and balloon angioplasty. Given the high thrombotic content, intracoronary abciximab was added to the double antiplatelet therapy already administered and it was decided to maintain anticoagulation with enoxaparin at therapeutic doses. Echocardiogram after catheterisation: left ventricle of normal size with inferior akinesia and inferolateral hypokinesia, leading to moderate ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 35%). Normal RVEF. Normal sized atria. Absence of significant valvular heart disease. Trivial tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating a systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery of 25 mmHg. Mild detachment of pericardial leaflets. Normal sized inferior vena cava with physiological inspiratory collapse. ECG at discharge: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm. Normal PR. Q wave in II, III and AVF. Persistence of minimal ST underleveling in these leads and in V5-V6.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient initially presented a good evolution in the coronary unit, with no new episodes of chest pain or signs of heart failure. Monitoring showed no ventricular arrhythmias. Two days later, he began to experience chest pain that worsened with inspiration and decubitus, with a clear pericardial profile, accompanied by elevated acute phase reactants in the blood tests (CRP 16, ESR 95). A new echocardiogram was performed and reported: "Study performed with HR 87 bpm and BP 102/73 mmHg. Left ventricle (LV) without being able to estimate real size, with normal wall thickness, except for the lower basal segment. Severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 33%). Lateral and inferior akinesia and severe hypokinesia of the rest of the segments. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size with mild systolic dysfunction. Normal sized atria, with right atrium with diastolic collapse. Mitral valve of normal appearance and function. Anatomically normal aortic valve with aortic flow recording with inspiratory descent of 20%. Severe circumferential pericardial effusion: maximum diameter 28 mm in subxiphoid plane, rest of the planes approximately 15-18 mm. Inferior vena cava (IVC) at the limit of dilatation with absence of inspiratory collapse and pattern in suprahepatic veins with inversion of the respiratory sinus Y, compatible with haemodynamic compromise. Contrast was administered to assess extravasation to the pericardial space without contrast passage. After the echocardiogram, pericardiocentesis was performed with extraction of abundant haematic fluid. Subsequently, the patient evolved satisfactorily without further incidents.   DIAGNOSIS Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) inferolateral Killip I. Severe vessel disease: circumflex artery with aneurysm and thrombotic occlusion. Effective thromboaspiration. Severe ventricular dysfunction. Epistenocardial pericarditis. Severe pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. Evacuative pericardiocentesis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Manages her medication. Does not meet frailty criteria (robust). KATZ A.  CURRENT ILLNESS He presented with worsening functional class, with dyspnoea on minimal effort, increased oedema in the lower limbs and orthopnoea which led him to sleep in a sitting position the night before admission. Recent admission (discharged 7 days ago) from another centre following mitral and aortic valve replacement surgery. The patient reported congestive symptoms a few days after discharge. He acknowledges salt intake in his usual diet at home, and has also started taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as a result of pain secondary to musculoskeletal pathology exacerbated after the recent admission.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 140/80 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 120 bpm, Sat 93% with nose glasses. Head and neck: no jugular venous engorgement Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: crackles in both bases.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: haemoglobin 10.3 mg/dl. Urea 62 mg/dl. Creatinine 1.8 mg/dl (GFR 39 mg/ml/1.73 m2), NT-proBNP 4550 pg/ml. Iron profile: total Fe 136, ferritin 150 g/l; IST 18%. TSH 2.1. HbA1C 7.9%. Albumin 2.6 mg/dl. Prealbumin 13 mg/dl. ECG: atrial fibrillation at 140 bpm. QRS 110 msg. Normal axis. No repolarisation alterations. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. Vascular redistribution. Bilateral pleural effusion. Previous sternotomy sutures. Echocardiogram: left ventricle with normal size, with concentric hypertrophy of moderate degree, without significant alterations of segmental contractility and with preserved global systolic function. Right ventricle with preserved size and function. Both atria severely dilated. Mitral biological prosthesis with no signs of dysfunction. Aortic biological prosthesis with no signs of dysfunction. Trivial IT allowing estimation of systolic pulmonary pressure of 35 mmHg. Aortic root and proximal ascending aorta of normal size. Inferior vena cava severely dilated and no respiratory changes. Absence of pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Poor evolution during the first days with persistence of congestive data despite high doses of loop diuretic (furosemide 180 mg per day, in intravenous boluses), control of water intake (less than 1.5 litres per day) and controlled salt intake at meals (dose of 2 g sodium chloride per day). The patient presented progressive deterioration of renal function in consecutive analyses, with creatinine levels of up to 2.6 mg/dl (GFR 24 ml/min/1.73 m2). In view of this worsening renal function, with glomerular filtration rates below 30 ml/h, it was decided to discontinue treatment with spironolactone. As a strategy, given that positive water balances persisted daily with worsening congestive data (third tone, increased crackles, worsening peripheral oedema), a combination diuretic strategy was decided upon. Bolus doses of loop diuretics were discontinued and replaced by intravenous infusion of furosemide, and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor diuretics (acetazolamide) were added to the treatment. Due to the history of recent prolonged hospitalisation and data of protein malnutrition, the nutrition service was contacted and protein-rich nutritional supplements were started. Twelve hours after initiating this new treatment strategy, the patient persisted with neutral balances. The patient presented clinical deterioration compatible with acute pulmonary oedema, which required admission to the coronary unit and ventilatory support with non-invasive mechanical ventilation. At this point, different therapeutic options were considered. Various pharmacological treatment options were considered, including increasing the dose of thiazide diuretics, prescribing hypertonic saline perfusion together with loop diuretic perfusion and even a more invasive strategy was considered, contacting the nephrology department to schedule haemodiafiltration sessions if necessary. The patient was reluctant to this last option, so it was decided to wait for a diuretic response in the following hours, adding hypertonic saline perfusion to the treatment (perfusion of 100 ml of 0.9% physiological saline with the addition of 1 ampoule of 20% ClNa). Finally, the patient started with a good diuretic rhythm, achieving negative water balances. A few days later, the improvement of congestion data was evident, with improvement of pulmonary auscultation and reduction of peripheral oedema, cardiac auscultation free of third tone. All this was accompanied by an analytical improvement in renal function, until creatinine levels before admission returned to normal. All this good evolution finally allowed the patient to be discharged from hospital.  DIAGNOSIS Decompensation of heart failure. Probable dietary transgression/NSAID intake. Preserved LVEF. Biological normofunctioning mitral and aortic prosthesis. Atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol. Impaired renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Probable cardio-renal syndrome. Normocytic normochromic anaemia. Diuretic resistance syndrome. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

No pericardial abnormalities. Late enhancement sequences show areas of faint diffuse intramyocardial uptake with no distribution corresponding to any coronary territory. This corresponds to the presence of signal hyperintensity on the STIR sequence. These data suggest the presence of oedema and inflammatory changes. Extracardiac findings: consolidation in the left lower lobe and atelectasis/subsegmental infiltrates in the right lower lobe. Conclusion: LV and RV with normal global and segmental systolic function. Signs of oedema and inflammatory changes in the LV with diffuse distribution compatible with the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis. Pathological anatomy of endomyocardial biopsy: histological sections of the submitted sample correspond to fragments of endomyocardial tissue that do not show endocardial lesions and show myocardium without architectural loss, with no granulomas or giant cells or neutrophilic or lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates. There are no signs of vasculitis. No malignancy is noted.  CLINICAL COURSE Initially, given the hypotension observed in the emergency department, intensive serum therapy was started with little response. Given the patient's symptoms and blood tests, the emergency department requested cardiology assessment, who performed an urgent transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction with global hypokinesia, as well as a thin layer of pericardial effusion that did not produce echocardiographic involvement of the cavities. Given the clinical and analytical data of haemodynamic instability (hypotension that did not respond to serum therapy, progressive distal hypoperfusion, hyperlactacidemia), it was decided to admit him to the coronary unit for monitoring and initiation of vasoactive drugs. Also, given the previous clinical manifestations of upper respiratory tract infection, a nasopharyngeal swab was requested for respiratory viruses (positive for influenza A virus) and empirical antimicrobial therapy was started with oseltamivir, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, the latter to cover possible bacterial superinfection. In the coronary unit, vasopressor support was started with noradrenaline at increasing doses and inotropic support with dobutamine, despite which the patient persisted with mean BP around 65 mmHg. Invasive haemodynamic monitoring by Swan-Ganz catheter showed the following initial parameters: cardiac index around 2 l/min/m2, PAPm 17 mmHg, PCP 15 mmHg, mixed venous saturation 50%. A new transthoracic echocardiogram was also performed, confirming the findings of the previous one, with a biplane Simpson LVEF of 28%, and also showing at least moderate right ventricular dysfunction with global hypokinesia and mild mitral insufficiency. During the following 24 hours, the patient showed a poor clinical and analytical response (NT-proBNP of 18,528 pg/ml at this time) to the treatment given, with progressive worsening of haemodynamic parameters (lactic acid 6.5 mmol/l, cardiac index in decline, oliguria) despite support with dobutamine at 13 mcg/kg/min and noradrenaline at 0.35 mcg/kg/min, so it was decided to implant an intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation device. During the balloon implantation, he presented an episode of severe hypotension with a drop in cardiac index to 1.5, requiring a significant increase in vasopressor support, with noradrenaline infusion of up to 2 mcg/kg/min, despite which lactic acid levels rose to 9.5. In this context, it was decided to contact cardiac surgery for urgent implantation of veno-arterial ECMO (Cardiohelp system), which was performed at the bedside without the need for orotracheal intubation (awake ECMO implantation), and the patient was transferred to the cardiac ICU for continuity of care. During her stay in the cardiac ICU, there was a progressive improvement in haemodynamic parameters that allowed early withdrawal of noradrenaline. A few hours later, he began to show symptoms compatible with acute ischaemia of the right lower limb, and the femoral artery was cannulated for distal perfusion, which had not been possible at first due to the urgency of the cannulation. An endomyocardial biopsy was also performed, with no peri- or post-procedural complications and no pathological findings. After 3 days of ECMO support, the echocardiogram showed recovery of ventricular function, so weaning was attempted under echocardiographic control. In this context, the patient presented congestive symptoms with desaturation and worsening respiratory mechanics, without simultaneous ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, but with a possible component of diastolic dysfunction, so it was decided not to withdraw assistance. Chest X-ray and lung ultrasound showed a large left pleural effusion, which was drained by thoracentesis, obtaining about 1,000 ml of serous fluid. A levosimendan infusion was also started, which was well tolerated from the haemodynamic point of view, and after 10 days of support, ECMO was withdrawn. In this context, he presented with significant bleeding with secondary instability, requiring polytransfusion and reinitiation of vasoactive support, but with a good evolution that also allowed the removal of the counterpulsation balloon. Once respiratory and haemodynamic stability was achieved, she was discharged to the conventional cardiology hospital ward, where she remained asymptomatic at all times, with no arrhythmic or other events during her stay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing data compatible with myocarditis, as well as preserved biventricular function, and cardiac and functional rehabilitation was started with good learning and clear improvement. The only sequelae of the patient was a slight limitation to dorsiflexion of the right foot. After 21 days of total hospitalisation and being practically in her baseline condition, she was discharged home with subsequent review in cardiology consultations.  DIAGNOSIS Cardiogenic shock with need for ECMO V-A implantation secondary to fulminant myocarditis due to influenza A. Transient severe LV systolic dysfunction in the context of the above. Viral upper respiratory tract infection due to influenza A. Partial acute respiratory failure secondary to all of the above. Acute right lower limb ischaemia after ECMO V-A cannulation, resolved. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 42-year-old male, with no known cardiovascular risk factors. History of heart murmur in childhood, operated on for pectus excavatum and diaphragmatic hernia. Under treatment with ibandronic acid and calcium carbonate. He was initially assessed at his reference hospital for a murmur, and the echocardiogram showed a slightly dilated left ventricle (LV) with slightly depressed systolic function (LVEF) (45% according to Simpson), a myxomatous mitral valve with prolapse of both leaflets leading to mild insufficiency, a right ventricle (RV) of normal size, but with an aneurysmal and akinetic apex and depressed systolic function, and aortic root at the upper limit of normality. In view of these findings, he was referred for specific consultation of familial heart disease for suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). At the first visit, the patient was asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view. Physical examination revealed a marfanoid appearance, with rhythmic heart tones and a systolic murmur II/VI in the mitral focus radiating to the axilla, with preserved vesicular murmur, no additional sounds on pulmonary auscultation and no oedema in the lower extremities. During outpatient follow-up, he began to experience dyspnoea on moderate exertion. To complete the study, Holter-ECG, cardiac magnetic resonance, transesophageal echocardiogram and genetic study were performed.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) in consultation: sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block and a deflection from S to pseudoR > 55 ms. The 24-hour Holter showed ventricular extrasystoles originating from the RV outflow tract with a density of 3% (6,935 beats) and a burst of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with RV outflow tract morphology of 11 beats, totally asymptomatic. Cardiac MRI showed a non-dilated RV with apical hypertrabeculation with dyskinetic movement of the free and apical anterior wall, with doubtful linear fibrofatty infiltration at that level and moderately depressed right systolic function (RVEF 36%). The left ventricle was slightly dilated, with apical hypertrabeculation associated with lateral mid-apical hypocontractility and mildly depressed systolic function (LVEF 48%). Transesophageal echocardiogram showed a myxomatous mitral valve with prolapse of both leaflets with mild insufficiency, aortic root at the high limit of normality and mild LV systolic dysfunction. The genetic study identified him as a heterozygous carrier of a mutation in the fibrillin 1 gene associated with Marfan syndrome (NC_000015.9 mutation: g. 48737574delC), with no mutations in the genes related to arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia. In view of these findings and given the patient's phenotype and clinical manifestations, we diagnosed Marfan syndrome and extended the genetic study to his children, who were found to be carriers, one of whom was also affected with mild aortic dilatation.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In view of the findings of the complementary tests and despite the fact that the genetic test for arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia was negative, we considered that the patient had this diagnosis, since he had one major criterion (anterior and apical RV dyskinesia with dysfunction < 40%) and 3 minor ones (> 500 VSD on Holter, NSVT with RV outflow tract morphology and deflection from S to pseudoR > 55 ms on the electrocardiogram). Given the results of the complementary tests and the history of asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, it was decided to implant an automatic defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention, in addition to medical treatment with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors). Since ICD implantation, the patient has had no shocks and remains in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II during follow-up visits.  DIAGNOSIS Biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with mild left and moderate right dysfunction, with mild left ventricular dilatation, anterior and apical RV dyskinesia and negative genetic study for RV arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Marfan syndrome; heterozygous carrier of mutation in the fibrillin 1 gene. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 51-year-old man, healthy until 1 month ago, came to the hospital and reported dyspnoea on exertion and oedema in the lower limbs. He came from an urban environment, had no toxic habits, had not travelled abroad and had no contact with animals. Physical examination revealed a fever of 37.5oC and blood pressure of 175/76. Auscultation revealed a 3/6 diastolic-systolic murmur in the aortic focus and crackles in the left base. There was hepatomegaly at 5 cm from the costal margin and oedema in the lower limbs with fovea. Laboratory tests showed intense leukocytosis with left deviation. An echocardiogram showed a heart rate of 95 bpm, severe aortic insufficiency with a large vegetation on the aortic valve and a smaller one on the mitral valve, a slightly dilated and hypertrophic left ventricle with a normal LVEF. In view of the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, 3 blood cultures were taken, a serum sample was extracted for serological studies and treatment was started with diuretics, captopril, vancomycin and gentamicin. Blood cultures remained negative after 5 days of incubation, at which point ceftriaxone was added to the previous antibiotic treatment. Five days after admission, the patient required valve replacement surgery; the aortic valve was replaced with a mechanical prosthesis and the mitral valve was repaired. The culture of the valve was negative and its study with a technique recently incorporated into the microbiology laboratory provided the aetiological diagnosis the day after surgery. Several days later, the anatomo-pathological study of the valve confirms the results. After 20 days of incubation, the blood cultures were still negative.  The patient presented with infective endocarditis with negative blood cultures. Between 2.5% and 30% of cases of infective endocarditis have negative conventional blood cultures. In about half of these cases the cause is antibiotic treatment prior to blood culture and in the remainder it is caused by microorganisms that are difficult to culture. Depending on the clinical-epidemiological context, the most likely etiological agents are Coxiella burnetii, Brucella species, Bartonella species, HACEK group bacteria and to a lesser extent Tropheryma whipplei, Chlamydia species, Legionella pneumophila and others. In this case the patient had not taken antibiotics and we should suspect microorganisms that cannot be cultured under normal conditions. The serologies performed for Coxiella burnetii, Brucella, Bartonella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and L. pneumophila were negative, making it difficult to establish an aetiological diagnosis. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and special tests were therefore necessary to reach a diagnosis.  Currently, the main method for the aetiological diagnosis of infective endocarditis is still blood culture. Three blood cultures (two bottles per blood culture, aerobic and anaerobic) should be taken before antibiotic treatment is instituted. When blood cultures are negative, serology is the most effective diagnostic method if the endocarditis is caused by C. burnetii, Bartonella and Brucella as in these cases it has a chronic course and high antibody titres are produced and a single serum is necessary. In the case of other microorganisms such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and L. pneumophila, cross-reactions must be ruled out and their diagnostic value is lower.  In our case, a positive result was obtained on the same day of surgery for a universal 16S rRNA PCR performed with DNA extracted from aortic valve tissue. The amplification product was sequenced the following day and the sequence obtained was aligned in Genebank using BLAST software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast), presenting 100% identity with the T. whipplei sequence.  To confirm the diagnosis, specific PCR of the hsp65 region of T. whipplei was performed and was also positive, confirming the identity of the product obtained by sequencing. Therefore, in case of endocarditis with negative blood cultures, a serum should be obtained for serology for the mentioned microorganisms and, if possible, the heart valve should be sent to a reference laboratory for universal PCR of the 16S rRNA gene. A fragment of the valve or vegetation should be sent to the anatomical pathology laboratory to confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis and to perform special stains: Gram, Wartin-Starry (Bartonella), PAS (T.whipplei), etc., which have high sensitivity and specificity. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cardiological history: Paroxysmal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) anticoagulated with aldocumar with good INR control. She had been assessed 1-2 years previously in outpatient cardiology consultations and bisoprolol was withdrawn due to first-degree atrioventricular block. An exercise test was performed to assess chest pain, which was clinically and electrically negative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (November 2016): non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with mild concentric hypertrophy, unaltered contractility with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), pseudonormal diastolic pattern with data suggestive of elevated pressures. No significant aortic valvular heart disease. Right ventricle (RV) not dilated with normal systolic function. Moderate left atrial (LA) dilatation. Mild mitral insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency. Estimated normal pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP).   Other history: Studied by pulmonology for dyspnoea without specific diagnosis. Normal respiratory function tests; chronically on a bronchodilator. Arthrosis. Depressive syndrome. She denies surgical interventions of interest. Previous medication: aldocumar 1 mg (1 tablet every day except Thursday and Sunday when he takes 1 and a half), furosemide 40 mg (half a tablet every 48 hours), paroxetine 20 mg (1 tablet at breakfast and half at lunch), omeprazole 20 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), quetiapine 25 mg (1 tablet at dinner), umeclidinium/vilanterol (55/22 mcg) inh every 24 hours, paracetamol 1 g (if required), hydroferol 0.266 mg (every 15 days).  CURRENT ILLNESS An 81-year-old woman, with the history described above, attended the emergency department due to worsening of dyspnoea in previous days until she became resting with associated tachypnoea and significant respiratory distress. The patient and family were told of progressive dyspnoea that had started as moderate exertion in previous weeks with wheezing. On the day of admission, her daughter went home and found her with dyspnoea and respiratory work complaining of epigastralgia that the patient could not define. She also reported cough and rhinorrhoea in recent weeks without fever. She denies chest pain (only occasionally with coughing) or palpitations. No orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, although the family reports that she has been sleeping badly for the last few days. She did not report decreased diuresis or oedema in the lower limbs. In the initial emergency department assessment, the patient was diagnosed with acute pulmonary oedema and treatment was started with parenteral bolus amiodarone, given that he was in rapid atrial fibrillation, which was poorly tolerated clinically.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Arrival: afebrile (36.7 ̊C), heart rate (HR) 120-145 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 114/96 mmHg, RF 31 rpm, baseline SatO2 90%.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION 81-year-old patient, with the history described above, admitted to the coronary cardiology unit for acute pulmonary oedema secondary to AF with rapid ventricular response. Initially, pharmacological cardioversion was performed with bolus administration and perfusion of amiodarone, which was ineffective, and, together with taking antidepressants at home, induced the appearance of a long QT. Secondary to QT prolongation, symptomatic polymorphic ventricular tachycardias were recorded, although without loss of pulse. After pharmacological lavage with fluid therapy and withdrawal of antidepressants, the QT interval was corrected and the ventricular arrhythmias disappeared. In this context, transthoracic echocardiography was carried out, with the following findings LVEF severely affected. In the admission analysis, elevated liver function tests were observed, and a referral was made to the gastroenterologist, who, in the light of the clinical evolution and abdominal ultrasound, diagnosed ischaemic hepatitis. Subsequently, he was transferred to the hospital ward, with progressive improvement of symptoms of acute heart failure. Due to associated respiratory symptoms, viral serologies were extracted and were positive for respiratory syncytial virus. These symptoms progressively disappeared with bronchodilator treatment. Regular transthoracic echocardiography was performed, confirming severe ventricular dysfunction, a finding that was also visualised in nuclear magnetic resonance. Due to persistent AF, electrical cardioversion was performed with reversion to sinus rhythm, remaining in sinus rhythm at the time of discharge, under treatment with amiodarone. Days after cardioversion, transthoracic echocardiography was performed, showing improvement in left ventricular dysfunction, confirming the diagnosis of tachycardiomyopathy. During his hospital stay, he presented several episodes of oligosymptomatic coronary vasospasm, with ST elevation in the inferior face and sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (maximum of 12 seconds). Diagnostic coronary angiography was performed, showing normal coronary arteries, and after starting treatment with nitrates and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, the episodes disappeared. Magnetic resonance imaging performed during admission (previously mentioned) showed late subendocardial enhancement in the inferolateral segment with an ischaemic profile, probably in the context of these vasospastic episodes. Due to the withdrawal of antidepressant medication, the patient began to show signs of major depression (anhedonia, abulia...) and so a consultation with psychiatry was requested, and after reintroduction of paroxetine, the condition was stabilised. The patient being asymptomatic and stable from the cardiovascular point of view, she was discharged home.  DIAGNOSIS Acute congestive heart failure with acute pulmonary oedema. Persistent AF with rapid ventricular response cardioverted chemically and electrically. Tachycardiomyopathy with moderate postcardioversion ventricular dysfunction. Sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes). Long QT (pharmacological). Coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina) with ventricular arrhythmias. Acute bronchitis without signs of respiratory infection. Ischaemic hepatitis. Cholelithiasis. Major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms. Intolerance to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors). Contraindication to beta-blockers due to vasospasm. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O

Mild-moderate pericardial effusion without haemodynamic involvement, with leaflet separation (2 mm over the anterior sac and over the roof of the right atrium (RA), 7 mm in the posterior, 10 mm in the lateral LV and 7 mm over the lateral RV). Fibrin tracts with partially organised effusion on the lateral aspect of the RV and the apex of the right ventricle (RV) are observed (without increased movement on the lateral aspect of the RA and RV and normocolapse of the cava). Thoracoabdominal CT: no axillary lymph nodes. Subcentimetric right paratracheal, bilateral prevascular and subcarinal mediastinal nodes, as well as right bronchopulmonary nodes, all of them with a reactive appearance. Bilateral laminar atelectasis. Discrete left pleural effusion with passive atelectasis of the underlying lung parenchyma, showing an aerial image that could correspond to a bulla in the collapsed parenchyma vs. bubble at the level of the pleural fluid (assess history of manipulation). Pericardial effusion with a maximum thickness of 27 mm in the lateral region of the left ventricle. Homogeneous liver, normal size and morphology, with a millimetric hypodense lesion in the dome, unspecific due to its small size. Cholelithiasis. Bile duct of normal calibre. Pancreas and spleen without alterations. Slight bilateral adrenal thickening with hyperplastic appearance. Kidneys of normal size and morphology, with good bilateral and symmetrical function. Bilateral simple cortical cysts, the largest of 53 mm in the upper pole of the left kidney and 52 mm in the upper third of the right kidney. No excretory tract ectasia. The bladder is scarcely replete, with no obvious parietal alterations. Prostate with a transverse axis of 44 mm. Sigmoid diverticulosis with no signs of complication. No significant intra-abdominal adenopathy or intraperitoneal free fluid. Bone degenerative signs. Electroneurogram: study compatible with sensory-motor polyneuropathy (PNP) in the lower limbs, of severe degree.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION On questioning the patient again, he reported asthenia, anorexia and weight loss (about 10 kg) in the last 3 months, which he attributed to the start of a hypocaloric diet from primary care. He also reported left cervical adenopathy that disappeared after taking ibuprofen together with erythematopapular lesions, which improved with topical corticosteroids, two months before his current admission; migratory arthralgias (in the elbows and right shoulder), persistent afternoon fever of 3 months' duration, haematuria and proteinuria in urine with normal renal function (confirmed in a general analysis at his primary care centre several weeks earlier). Episode of rhinitis and epistaxis two months earlier, resolved with intranasal corticosteroids. An echocardiogram was performed which showed no significant valvular heart disease, slight pleural effusion and moderate pericardial effusion without repercussions. In view of the significant general and systemic involvement, acute phase reactants and autoimmunity tests were requested, with significant elevation of CRP, ESR and positive P-ANCA and C-ANCA autoantibodies. Given the high suspicion of vasculitis with renal involvement, a discussion was held with the nephrology department, who did not consider a renal biopsy to be indicated at the present time, and with the internal medicine department (autoimmune diseases). The study was completed with an electroneurogram which showed data compatible with severe polyneuropathy of the lower limbs. Given the diagnosis of C-ANCA-positive vasculitis, treatment with corticoids was started, in agreement with the autoimmune unit, with significant improvement in general condition and reduction of pericardial effusion, which at discharge was only slight-moderate in the posterior sac. From the cardiovascular point of view, he remains in atrial fibrillation with adequate heart rate control with beta-blockers. Initially, given that he has not completed 4 weeks of anticoagulation and that the main problem is his autoimmune pathology, a strategy of rate control is advocated, considering elective cardioversion on an outpatient basis according to clinical evolution. Clinically and haemodynamically stable, he was discharged from hospital with the following treatment: methotrexate 20 mg (one injection weekly), folic acid 5 mg (1 tablet weekly after methotrexate injection), prednisone 30 mg (2 tablets at breakfast), bisoprolol 5 mg (at breakfast) and 2.5 mg (at dinner), apixaban 5 mg (at breakfast and dinner), simvastatin 40 mg (at dinner), omeprazole 20 mg (fasting) and furosemide 40 mg (at breakfast).  DIAGNOSIS Vasculitis C-ANCA positive. Pleuropericardial effusion of autoimmune aetiology. Atrial fibrillation of uncertain onset with controlled ventricular response at discharge, CHADSVASc 2, HASBLED 1. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  The patient is a 57-year-old male, a former smoker, dyslipidaemic and with a history of chronic ischaemic heart disease. One year ago, after suffering unstable angina with positive ergometry, coronary angiography was performed which revealed coronary artery disease of the anterior descending artery, which was revascularised by implanting a drug-eluting stent. He also had gastro-oesophageal reflux and had undergone surgery for an inguinal hernia. He was currently being treated with aspirin, torasemide and pantoprazole. He attended the emergency department of our centre for progressive dyspnoea of 4 months' evolution associated with intense asthenia, generalised weakness, weight loss of 25 kg in this period and frequent episodes of diarrhoea. There had been a clear clinical worsening of the dyspnoea in the last two weeks to the point of minimal effort, together with the appearance of oedema in the lower limbs. He denied episodes of central chest pain, orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He also reported no cough, expectoration, fever or night sweats or bleeding. On arrival at the ED, blood pressure (BP) was 110/60, heart rate (HR) was 90 bpm and baseline O2 SatO2 was 96%. Physical examination revealed increased jugular venous pressure, a flail chest and the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon in both hands. Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed rhythmic heart sounds with a systolic murmur in the mitral focus and crackles in the left base. He also had oedema with fovea up to the knee.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Baseline electrocardiogram: RS at 75 bpm, PR 200 ms, right bundle branch block (RBBB) with signs of right ventricular (RV) overload. Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index (CTI) at the upper limit of normality, possible paratracheal lymphadenopathy. Minimal vascular redistribution. Laboratory tests: Biochemistry: glucose 89, creatinine 0.75, urea 36, uric acid 8.5, Na 140, K 4, NTproBNP 1800, CRP 50. Interferon B negative, B2-microglobulin 3.27, ANA 1/640 with rest of autoimmunity study normal, complement normal, tumour markers negative. Serology negative. Haemogram: Hb 9.4, leukocytes 6,400 (normal formula), platelets 66,000. Coagulation: INR 1.4, PT 67%. Echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal size and preserved function with mild hypertrophy (interventricular septum 12 mm). Diastolic dysfunction with pseudonormal mitral filling pattern (E/e' lateral side of 15). Right ventricle of normal size and function. No evidence of pulmonary hypertension at rest. Mild mitral insufficiency without other associated valvulopathies. Mild pericardial effusion without echocardiographic data of haemodynamic compromise. Cardiac MRI: moderate bilateral pleural effusion with passive atelectasis of the left lower lobe. Circumferential pericardial effusion with a maximum thickness of 2 cm on the right lateral aspect. Myocardial thickness preserved. Perfusion study without alterations. No pathological gadolinium deposits were observed. Biventricular function preserved. Angio-CT of pulmonary arteries: no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism. CT scan: small moderate right pleural effusion and left pleural effusion sheet. Both lung bases show a cobblestone pattern with bronchiectasis, parenchymal distortion and honeycomb cysts. Bilateral hilar adenopathy. Cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion. In conclusion: study compatible with non-specific interstitial pulmonary fibrosis that may correspond to collagen disease (systemic sclerosis).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was initially admitted to our department for heart failure with associated pericardial effusion, and diuretic treatment was started with marked clinical improvement. Once stable and having ruled out clinical and echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade and the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism by means of an angio-CT scan of the pulmonary arteries, a referral was made to the gastrointestinal department to study a diarrhoeal process secondary to possible inflammatory bowel disease and to internal medicine for a study of the general syndrome. As part of the battery of tests performed during admission, a colonoscopy was requested in order to rule out digestive tumour pathology causing this general syndrome. After administering the preparation for this test, the patient suffered an episode of sudden dizziness and the electrocardiogram showed the presence of complete atrioventricular block with wide QRS leakage at 40 bpm, at which time he was being treated with low-dose atenolol. The patient was transferred to the coronary unit where a temporary electrode was implanted via the right jugular vein. After a negative chronotropic medication washout period and verification of the absence of adequate atrioventricular conduction, a DDDR bicameral permanent pacemaker was implanted without incident. He had a good postoperative course and was discharged. Given the suspicion of an infiltrative cardiomyopathy secondary to a systemic disease with involvement of several organs, the patient was assessed by the rheumatology department and the internal medicine department. The study was completed with a CAT scan that showed a pattern in both bases suggestive of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, a spirometry that showed moderate restriction and a slight decrease in diffusion and an electromyogram in which data compatible with myopathy were observed. In addition, a skin biopsy was performed which revealed histological findings compatible with scleroderma. With these data, and with the persistence of episodes of self-limited diarrhoea due to a probable malabsorptive component, the diagnosis of diffuse systemic sclerosis with cutaneous, cardiac (atrioventricular block, pericardial effusion), pulmonary (interstitial pulmonary fibrosis) and digestive (malabsorption) involvement was confirmed. Treatment with cyclophosphamide was started, with poor tolerance due to renal and bone marrow toxicity. Subsequently, he presented poor clinical evolution with progressive worsening of his functional class and suffered several admissions for heart failure with a predominance of congestion data refractory to diuretic treatment, and the patient died one year after diagnosis.  DIAGNOSIS Diffuse systemic sclerosis with cutaneous, pulmonary, cardiac and digestive involvement. Congestive heart failure with preserved EF. Mild-moderate pleuro-pericardial effusion. Complete atrioventricular block. Implantation of DDDR bicameral definitive pacemaker. Thrombopenia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 55-year-old male patient with the following personal history: No known adverse drug reactions. Cardiovascular risk factors: smoker. No family history of interest.  Cardiological history: chronic ischaemic heart disease: 2004: ACS. Conservative management. October 2018: assessed in cardiology outpatient clinic for angina. The patient had no signs of heart failure and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no alterations of interest. The following complementary tests were requested: Transthoracic echocardiography: non-dilated left ventricle, with a slight increase in septal wall thickness. Slight hypokinesia at the septal level in the basal and middle segments with adequate contractility of the remaining segments, with overall preserved LV systolic function. No aortic and left atrial root dilatation. Right chambers not dilated with preserved right ventricular systolic function. No significant organic valvular pathology. Vena cava not dilated with adequate respiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. Diagnostic coronary angiography: Coronary trunk with non-significant angiographic lesions. Anterior descending artery with severe stenosis from its origin to the middle segment and in the distal third with thin distal bed and TIMI 2 flow. Recanalisation of septal branches by heterocoronary circulation. Circumflex artery (Cx) with non-significant angiographic lesions. Dominant right coronary artery, diffusely diseased, with non-significant focal lesion. In view of these findings, it was decided to assess myocardial viability in order to decide on the approach to revascularisation. Stress echocardiography was requested: a stress test was performed with dobutamine, until reaching 15 mcg/kg/min and doubling the baseline heart rate (HR), showing an improvement until almost normalisation of the motility of the septal segments described with hyperdynamic systolic function. Absence of complications. Clinically asymptomatic and without electrical changes. Preserved LVEF, viable myocardium. November 2018: patient placed on waiting list for surgical revascularisation Usual treatment: ramipril 5 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), nitroglycerin patch 10 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), omeprazole 20 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), fluvastatin 80 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours) and bisoprolol 2.5 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours). On 6 December, while the patient was out for a walk, he began to feel generally unwell and then suffered syncope. Witnesses tried unsuccessfully to wake him up and called the emergency services. The emergency team took approximately 10 minutes to arrive, finding cardiorespiratory arrest, with bradycardia at 45 bpm and no pulse (electromechanical dissociation). In this context, advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) manoeuvres were started, a total of 3 ampoules of adrenaline were administered and the patient was intubated orotracheally. After 20 minutes of performing these manoeuvres, a ventricular fibrillation rhythm was observed, from which the patient was defibrillated with a shock at 360 Joules. An ECG was then performed showing: irregular tachycardia at 130 bpm, QRS at 120 ms, ST-segment elevation in inferior leads and V1. QS pattern in V2 and V3 with ST elevation of 2-3 mm in V2-V4 and aVR. On-call cardiology was contacted, the haemodynamics service was activated and the patient was transferred to our centre. On arrival at the emergency department, an urgent echocardiogram was performed, documenting severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with severe hypokinesia in the territory of the anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient was haemodynamically unstable and noradrenaline and dobutamine perfusion was started. Primary angioplasty is then performed.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS First ECG after recovery of spontaneous circulation: irregular tachycardia at about 130 bpm, QRS at 120 ms, ST-segment elevation in inferior leads and V1. QS pattern in V2 and V3 with ST elevation of 2-3 mm in V2-V4 and aVR. Transthoracic echocardiography in the emergency department: limited study due to poor echocardiographic window but showing severe left ventricular dysfunction, with severe hypokinesia in the territory of the anterior descending artery. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention: diseased left main trunk with significant ostial involvement. Diffusely diseased LAD with severe proximal plaque and no visualisation of the distal bed. Cx with significant proximal plaque; rest of vessel without lesions. Right coronary artery with diffuse lesions not amenable to revascularisation. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the left main coronary artery (LMCA), CX and ADA: given the situation observed, it was decided to pass the guidewire to the ADA and the CX, implant a drug-eluting stent (Resolute Onyx 3.5 x 8 mm) ostial and a "V" stent towards the Cx (Resolute Onyx 3 x 22 mm) and towards the ADA (Resolute Onyx 3 x 26 mm). Balloon angioplasty (2.25 and 2.5 mm) was then performed to the LAD and a stent was implanted overlapping the previous one (Resolute Onyx 2.75 x 18 mm), with a good final angiographic result. Laboratory tests on admission to the coronary unit: Hb 13.7 g/dl, haematocrit 44%. Normal white blood count but with lymphocytosis of 7,140. Platelets 232,000. Blood glucose 261 mg/dl. Cr 1.40 mg/dl, urea 34 mg/dl. Na 133, K 3.8. NT-proBNP 4623 pg/ml. CPK 180 - 3824 - 1266 - 464 - 1181 - 2959 - 1373 - 408; and TnT 20 - 4518 - 5207 - 3664 - 4535 - 3483 - 3809 - 1472. GSV pH 6.8; Lactic 12.9; pCO2 74 mm Hg. Total cholesterol 95 mg/dl; HDL cholesterol 30 mg/dl; LDL cholesterol 22 mg/dl; triglycerides 241. Neuro-specific enolase 28.1. Transthoracic echocardiography at discharge: left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophic with hypokinesia of mid and apical antero-septal segments, without other segmental contractility disorders. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 51% by Simpson biplane. Left atrium not dilated. Right chambers of normal size and function with preserved right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF). Mild degenerative mitro-aortic signs without significant associated valvulopathies. No pericardial effusion. Inferior vena cava not dilated with adequate inspiratory collapse.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After the intervention, the patient was transferred to the coronary unit and on arrival a neurological window was performed, showing a motor Glasgow of 5 points, so it was decided to perform therapeutic hypothermia, with a target temperature of 33 ̊C, using the Artic-Sun device. He was sedated with propofol, relaxed with rocuronium and analgesia with fentanyl for 24 hours. During this period, haemodynamic improvement was observed, which allowed for the progressive withdrawal of amine support. After 24 hours, rewarming is started. Once the protocol is completed, sedoanalgesia and relaxation medication is withdrawn. The patient awoke slowly and, during this process, an electroencephalographic study was carried out, which described: "Abnormal electroencephalographic tracing due to the absence of normal rhythms and generalised slowing of baseline activity, with no clear EEG response to stimuli, reflecting mild-moderate diffuse brain damage. No epileptiform activity or significant asymmetries were recorded". The evolution was slow and he presented several complications: aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, moderate neurogenic oropharyngeal dysphagia. Finally, after a total of 17 days in the coronary unit, he was transferred to the cardiology ward. His evolution on the ward was very good; he started to ambulate progressively and was finally discharged home.

A 59-year-old man came to the Emergency Department with a history of malaise in the last month and confusion in the last 3 days. He reported no fever or localised complaints. The patient had a history of poorly controlled diabetes, dyslipidaemia and schizoaffective disorder. He was agitated, his temperature was 38.3oC, cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal and he had mild ankle oedema. The most significant laboratory data were 18,700 leukocytes/mm3, 10.4 g/dL haemoglobin, plasma glucose 750 mg/dL and C-reactive protein 12.6 mg/dL. A blood culture was drawn, he was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome secondary to acute infection, and was treated with intravenous fluids, insulin and cefuroxime. Improvement was noted. On the third day, the clinical microbiology laboratory detected growth of small gram-negative bacilli in both blood culture bottles. One day later, rough, raised, non-hemolytic, non-hemolytic colonies of various sizes grew on the blood agar and chocolate agar plates, but not on the MacConkey agar plate. The colonies were positive for oxidase and negative for lacatalase, indole and urease. The isolate was identified, using the API 20E (bioMérieux) and RapIDNF Plus (Remel) systems, as Pasteurella haemolytica and reported as sensitive to cefuroxime. The patient was re-interviewed and reported that he had a cat at home that had bitten him several times in the last month. During the remainder of his hospitalisation the patient was afebrile but had several episodes of pulmonary congestion. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed moderate left ventricular dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation. When stabilised, he was transferred to a rehabilitation unit where he completed a 10-day course of cefuroxime. One week later he was readmitted for increased dyspnoea and peripheral oedema. He was treated with diuretics with minimal improvement. He underwent a repeat TTE which this time showed significant aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation. Due to persistent pulmonary congestion the patient was referred to surgery for replacement of his aortic and mitral valves. Small vegetations on the aortic valve were observed at the operation. Blood culture criteria require the isolation of a microorganism of the Streptococcus viridans group, Streptococcus bovis, one of the HACEK group (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenellacorrodens and Kingella species) or Staphylococcus aureus in at least 2 blood cultures taken 12 or more hours apart. Therefore, the collection of more than one blood culture before starting antibiotic treatment and the correct identification of blood isolates are of paramount value in the diagnosis of IE. Valvular vegetation was cultured, but no growth was obtained; there was also no growth in the additional blood cultures taken on the second admission. Culture-negative endocarditis can result from the use of inadequate microbiological techniques, infection by very demanding pathogens (such as Bartonella, Brucella or Chlamydia species), or antimicrobial administration prior to blood culture collection. In the present case, the 16S rRNA amplicon sequence of the valve tissue had >99% concordance with that of Haemophilus aphrophilus. Subsequently, the blood isolate previously identified as Pasteurella haemolytica was identified as H. aphrophilus. In the present case, the "chain of errors" started with insufficient inoculum to the tubes with oxidation/fermentation medium resulting in the erroneous characterisation of the isolate as "non-fermenting" which led to the selection of identification systems used for non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria, irrelevant in this case. Another possible cause of confusion for clinical microbiologists is that H. aphrophilus is one of only two Haemophilus species (the other being Haemophilus ducreyi) that does not require NAD (factor V) for growth and therefore can grow on blood agar. The genera Haemophilus and Pasteurella both belong to the same family (Pasteurelleae) and misidentification of H. aphrophilus as Pasteurella using commercial identification kits is well known.  In the present case, it is possible that correct identification and reporting of the isolate would have alerted the clinician to the possibility of IE and would have led to appropriate treatment at the first hospital admission. Therefore, it could have prevented the progression of valve destruction and the need for valve replacement. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY This is a 75-year-old male patient with a history of smoking, hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity. His cardiological history includes ischaemic heart disease in dilated phase with surgical revascularisation and mitral valve replacement with mechanical prosthesis due to severe mitral insufficiency in 2005. Single-chamber pacemaker implantation with atrioventricular node ablation was performed due to multiple admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) type 2 in the context of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. In 2000 he underwent amputation of the right foot and right femoral-popliteal bypass and in 2008 exclusion of the left iliac and femoral aneurysm. The last echocardiogram in May 2018 showed severe left ventricular dysfunction, mitral prosthesis with mean gradient of 4 mmHg without periprosthetic insufficiency and moderate aortic insufficiency. Standard treatment: sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg (1 tablet at breakfast and 1 tablet at dinner), metoprolol 100 mg (1 tablet at breakfast and 1 tablet at dinner), furosemide 40 mg ( 1 tablet at breakfast and 1 tablet at lunch), acenocoumarol according to haematology guidelines, insulin lantus 20 IU at breakfast, eplerenone 25 mg (1/2 tablet at lunch), atorvastatin 20 mg (1 tablet at dinner), salmeterol/fluticasone 25/50 mcg 1 inhalation every 12 hours, chronic home oxygen.   CURRENT ILLNESS Admitted in February 2019 for critical right lower limb ischaemia due to right femoro-popliteal bypass thrombosis, right anterior femoro-tibial bypass was performed. During this admission, acenocoumarol was withdrawn and anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) was prescribed, with poor compliance by the patient. In usual functional class III/IV, he was admitted to internal medicine with progressive worsening of the same until presenting dyspnoea at rest, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, orthopnoea, oliguria and oedema in the lower limbs. No chest pain or other symptoms of interest. Treatment was intensified with diuretics and vasodilators without improvement. He presented with an episode of acute pulmonary oedema and was transferred to the coronary unit.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure 147/66 mmHg. Heart rate 80 bpm. Oxygen saturation 91% with nasal goggles at 4 litres, jugular venous pressure elevated. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds with prosthetic click. Pulmonary auscultation: crackles up to midfield. Abdomen: globular, depressible, with non-painful hepatomegaly 3 cm below the costal margin. Lower extremities: oedema up to the knees with amputation of the right foot.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation. Ventricular stimulation at 70 bpm, without sensing or capture failures. X-ray: increased cardiothoracic index (CTI), with vascular cephalisation, Kerley's B lines. Blood tests: Biochemistry: urea 91 mg/dl, creatinine 1.45mg/dl, glomerular filtration 47 ml/min, NT-proBNP 6,587 pg/ml, procalcitonin 0.096 ng/ml, C-reactive protein 96.5 mg/l. Basal venous blood gases: pH 7.38, PCO2 44.5 mmHg, PO2 37.6 mmHg, bicarbonate 24.6 mmol/l, oxygen saturation 65.4%. Haemogram: leukocytes 8,300/mm3, leukocyte formula normal, haemoglobin 12.7 g/dl, platelets 161,000/mm3. Coagulation: INR 1.76, prothrombin time 47%, activated partial thromboplastin time 36.2 seconds. Transesophageal echocardiogram: bidisc mitral mechanical prosthesis with immobility of the anterolateral disc in semi-closed position and incomplete mobility of the other disc, with two symmetrical small jets of intraprosthetic regurgitation, with image of thrombus in hinge and prosthetic ring without relevant mobile images. Mean transmitral gradient of 19 mmHg. Coronary CT angiography: mechanical prosthesis in mitral position, showing a soft tissue density of low attenuation (hypodense), located between the two valve discs and extending along the atrial and ventricular side of the posterior disc, which remains immobile throughout the cardiac cycle. This lesion has a low attenuation (Hounsfield units between 60-80), which is compatible with valvular thrombus and, given its attenuation values, probably responds well to fibrinolytic treatment. Radioscopy: immobility of the anterolateral disc and incomplete mobility of the other disc of the mechanical mitral prosthesis. Transthoracic echocardiogram after two fibrinolysis: decrease in transmitral gradient of 7.8 mmHg after two consecutive fibrinolysis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In the coronary unit, antithrombotic treatment was intensified with sodium heparin, acenocoumarol and clopidogrel. After failing to resolve the thrombus and in view of the worsening clinical condition, it was decided to present the case at a medical-surgical session, and the patient was rejected for valve replacement surgery due to multiple comorbidities and a high risk of mortality (around 90%). Fibrinolytic treatment was decided, in our case with alteplase, taking the coronary angio-CT result as a predictor of a favourable outcome after fibrinolysis. Twenty-four hours after treatment with alteplase, the patient showed substantial improvement in congestive signs and symptoms, with adequate diuresis with intravenous furosemide, stable haemodynamic parameters and a decrease in the mean mitral transprosthetic gradient from 20 to 10 mmHg. Despite the decrease in the gradient, it was still high, so a second fibrinolysis was decided 96 hours after the first dose, presenting a transmitral gradient of 7 mmHg 48 hours after this second therapy. As a haemorrhagic event, he only presented self-limited haematuria with no significant decrease in haemoglobin levels.  DIAGNOSIS Severe mitral stenosis due to very late mitral valve prosthetic thrombosis related to non-compliance with anticoagulation therapy. Decompensated chronic heart failure, NYHA functional class IV/IV, stage C AHA/ACC. Good response after two consecutive fibrinolysis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Usual treatment: enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg/day, lorazepam 1 mg/day.  CURRENT ILLNESS A 79-year-old female patient attended the emergency department of our centre presenting with progressive dyspnoea of one month's duration until becoming minimal effort in the last 48-72 hours, together with accompanying asthenia and weakness. He denied clinical signs of chest pain. No cough, no expectoration, no fever, no dysthermic sensation.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION General condition was normal, normohydrated, normal colour. Eupneic at rest with no use of accessory muscles. Conscious, oriented and cooperative, with no apparent neurological focality. Blood pressure (BP) 95/55 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 130 bpm, oxygen saturation (SatO2) 98% (ambient air). Cardiac auscultation: regular sounds, tachycardic, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: generalised hypoventilation, no rales. No oedema in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS During his stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) the following complementary tests were performed: Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: sinus rhythm at 96 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS with axis at 0o, ST underlevel of up to 2 mm in V3-V6 with 1 mm sublevel in aVR. Isolated ventricular extrasystole. Chest X-ray: hyperventilated lungs with normal parenchymal density, no nodular condensation. No alveolar space condensation. Normal mediastinal silhouette and pulmonary hilarity, with no space-occupying lesions. Laboratory tests on admission: creatinine 1.65 mg/dl, C-reactive protein (CRP) 111.6 mg/l, leukocytes 11.71x10^9/l, neutrophils 4.58 x10^9/l, lymphocytes 0.96 x10^9/l, monocytes 0.28 x10^9/l, eosinophils 5.88 x10^9/l, basophils 0.01 x10^9/l, haemoglobin 10 g/dl, ultrasensitive troponin T 1.911 pg/ml. Coronary angiography: normal epicardial coronary arteries. Ventriculography normal.  During his hospitalisation in cardiology the following complementary tests were performed: Transthoracic echocardiography: normal sized left ventricle with moderate concentric hypertrophy without apparent alterations in segmental contractility and with preserved systolic function. Diastolic filling pattern of impaired relaxation. Mild aortic insufficiency on degenerative valve with normal transvalvular gradients. Non-dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI) allowing estimation of a systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs) of 32 mmHg. No significant pericardial effusion is observed. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): left ventricle with concentric hypertrophy (14 mm), preserved mass (IMVI: 71 g/m2), concentric remodelling pattern, reduced volumes (IVTDVI 38 ml/m2; IVTSVI 14 ml/m2) and segmental and global systolic function within normal (LVEF 64%). Widespread patchy subendocardial and intramyocardial oedema, more marked on the lateral aspect, basal anterior and apex. Right ventricular volume (IVTDVD 26 ml/m2; IVTSVD 11 ml/m2) and systolic function preserved (RVEF 58%). Atria and great vessels of preserved dimensions. First-pass perfusion at rest (IV dimeglumine gadobenate 0.0075 mmol/kg) with patchy subendocardial defects. Absence of myocardial necrosis. Presence of small foci of subendocardial uptake at the level of the basal anterior and medial lateral aspect, also affecting papillary muscles. Slight pericardial effusion. In summary, acute myocarditis pattern with pseudohypertrophy due to multifocal myocardial oedema, preserved systolic function and small foci of late uptake in the left ventricle. Peripheral blood smear: discrete erythrocyte anisopoikilocytosis with the presence of some isolated spherocytes and elliptocytes. Normocytic anaemia with a tendency to hypochromia is confirmed. No other morphological findings of interest. Manual leukocyte formula: 26% segmented, 6% lymphocytes, 68% mature-looking eosinophils. Specific proteins: complement C3 110 mg/dl, complement C4 47 mg/dl, total IgE (immunoglobulin E) 306.3 IU/ml. Parasite studies: negative. Serology: only positive for Toxoplasma gondii IgG. Bone marrow aspirate: abundant lump that is conspicuously absent of cellularity. Only some plasma cells and peripheral blood cells are seen. Conclusion: bone marrow with abundant lump empty of cellularity. Bone marrow biopsy: bone marrow aplasia, without correlation with peripheral blood.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION When an ECG was performed in the emergency department, ST segment alterations were observed (ST-segment depression of up to 2 mm in V3-V6 with a 1 mm depression in aVR), and a blood test for ultrasensitive troponin T was requested, the result of which was 1,911 pg/ml. In view of these findings, the patient was admitted to the ICU with initial suspicion of high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). During her stay in the ICU, coronary angiography was performed which ruled out coronary artery disease and ventriculography showed no alterations, and she was discharged to the cardiology ward with a diagnosis of MINOCA (acute myocardial infarction without obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease) to complete studies and appropriate treatment. After admission to cardiology, the patient remained asthenic with stable haemoglobin levels of around 10 g/dL and eosinophilia that progressively increased to a maximum of 8.35x10^9/l absolute eosinophils. Treatment with beta-blockers was started and he remained at absolute rest with progressive control of heart rate and without tachy or bradyarrhythmias, nor presenting symptoms suggestive of these. At no time did she present symptoms compatible with heart failure. In view of the CMR findings and the hypereosinophilia in peripheral blood, the patient was diagnosed with eosinophilic myocarditis and treatment was started with prednisone 50 mg per day with overall symptomatic improvement, with a gradual decrease in peripheral eosinophilia, as well as a decrease in ultrasensitive troponin T. Therefore, the dose of prednisone was gradually reduced. Therefore, the dose of beta-blocker was progressively reduced and she started to ambulate with good tolerance. During her admission, she was studied by the internal medicine and haematology departments and various complementary tests were performed, such as bone marrow biopsy, among others, labelling the symptoms as hypereosinophilia of uncertain origin, without finding an underlying aetiology (negative autoimmunity, negative OM biopsy, negative parasites), and so she was left to continue follow-up after discharge from outpatient clinics. After 10 days of hospitalisation, with the patient stable and asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view, tolerating ambulation without symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmic complications, with markers of myocardial damage in decline and electrocardiographic normalisation, it was decided to discharge her from hospital with close outpatient monitoring and treatment with prednisone in a descending pattern until a maintenance dose of 10 mg was achieved for at least 6 months depending on her evolution.  DIAGNOSIS Acute eosinophilic myocarditis. Hypereosinophilia of uncertain origin. Arterial hypertension. Chronic anaemia. Disease-free uterine carcinosarcoma. Disease-free adenocarcinoma of the colon. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Transthoracic echocardiogram: hypertrophic left ventricle (LV) with IVS of 15 mm, mottling inside and segmental abnormalities of apical contractility. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40%. Longitudinal Strain of -8%. Right ventricle (RV) of normal size and function (TAPSE 19 mm). Mild left atrial dilatation. Tricuspid aortic valve with fibrous leaflets and severe insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI), with no evidence of PHT at rest. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): LV of normal size (45 mm) with myocardial thickening, the greatest thicknesses being as follows: mid anterior septum 16 mm, mid inferior septum 11 mm, apical septum 12 mm, apical postero-inferior wall: 10 mm. LVEF 37%. VTD-VI 134 ml (85 ml/m2), VTS-VI 84 ml (50 ml/m2), VL-VI 50 ml (32 ml/m2). RV of normal size (33 mm) with mild dysfunction due to altered longitudinal and radial contractility (the latter to a lesser extent). No perfusion defects are observed. The myocardial signal is not cancelled, identifying a late intramyocardial enhancement, patchy and diffuse throughout the myocardium of the left ventricle, also in the right ventricle with enhancement of the wall of both atria. Normal right atrium (RA) (17 cm2). Dilated left atrium (LA) (27 cm2). Trivalve aortic valve with sclerosed leaflets and slightly reduced opening. Flow turbulence in relation to aortic insufficiency (AIo). Conclusion: the findings described are compatible with clinical suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis. Myocardial scintigraphy: images of the chest were obtained in anterior and posterior projections. Radiopharmaceutical uptake was observed in the cardiac muscle, a finding compatible with amyloidosis due to transthyretin deposits. Electromyogram: the neurophysiological study showed data compatible with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome of moderate intensity and predominantly on the right.   CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his stay on the hospital ward, the patient responded favourably to depletive treatment with diuretics, mainly loop diuretics. He also receives treatment with mineralcorticoid receptor inhibitors, which must be adjusted due to the impairment of renal function, which is detrimentally affected by the contrast used in the various diagnostic tests. As an incidence during hospitalisation, the patient presents multiple bouts of non-sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (NSMVT) on telemetry, requiring treatment with beta-blockers at low doses despite being in heart failure, due to the problems caused by the use of other antiarrhythmic drugs in amyloidosis. Although the patient presents segmental contractility alterations in the transthoracic echocardiogram and multiple cardiovascular risk factors, due to renal impairment and low clinical suspicion, diagnostic catheterisation to rule out ischaemic involvement is discouraged. Due to the patient's neurological symptoms, it was decided to perform an electromyogram which confirmed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and a referral was made to neurology, who recommended further study on an outpatient basis due to possible polyneuropathy. With regard to the progression of aortic insufficiency, surgical treatment was ruled out as the symptoms of dyspnoea were mainly due to the deposition disease (predominantly right), the LVEF was normal and there was no left ventricular dilatation, so there was no indication for valve replacement and outpatient follow-up was considered appropriate. On discharge, the patient was referred to a family heart disease consultation and to a neurology consultation following electromyography of the lower limbs.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure (first episode). Amyloidosis due to transthyretin (pending completion of filiation). Severe aortic insufficiency. Moderately depressed LVEF. Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Chronic renal failure, stage 3A. Possible peripheral polyneuropathy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY No known drug allergies. Social background: gypsy ethnicity. Lives with his family. Sporadic work as a street vendor. No family history of heart disease or sudden death. Cardiovascular risk factors: no known metabolic diseases. Toxic habits: active smoker of 1 packet of cigarettes per day (cumulative consumption of 20 packs per year). Sporadic use of cannabis. Denies alcohol or other substance intake. Previous cardiological history: Biventricular arrhythmogenic dysplasia with recently diagnosed LMNA gene mutation. Debuts in October 2018 with an episode of congestive heart failure (CHF), showing severe biventricular dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 23%. A genetic study confirmed arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy due to mutation in exon 3 of the LMNA gene. From October 2018 to March 2019, the patient required three hospital admissions for decompensation of CHF. Outpatient follow-up is performed by the advanced heart failure unit, but the patient does not keep medical appointments and has poor compliance with treatment. Patient with a Medtronic visia SR MRI model single-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention, after several bouts of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) on admission in November 2018 Right atrial appendage thrombus evidenced in CMR performed in November 2018, starting anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) since then. Complementary tests performed to date: TTE: left ventricle (LV) slightly dilated with normal wall thickness. Severe LV hypokinesia of all segments, diffusely. Severely depressed LVEF (23% by biplane Simpson's Simpson biplane). Normal transmitral filling flow. Dilated right ventricle (RV) with severely depressed function. Slightly displaced LV septum as a sign of right chamber overload. Severe tricuspid insufficiency, with central regurgitation jet due to leaflet coaptation deficit, possibly of functional origin. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PSAP) 25-30 mmHg. No other valvulopathies. Inferior vena cava (IVC) dilated, not collapsing on inspiration. No pericardial effusion. DCM: dilated cardiomyopathy with severe dysfunction of both ventricles and dilatation of both atria. Aneurysmal dilatation and akinesia of the RV outflow tract. Areas of late enhancement in RV free wall and intramyocardial enhancement in lateral and inferior aspects of the LV. Thrombi in the right atrial appendage. Computed tomography (CT) of coronary arteries: no anomalies in the origin of the coronary arteries or significant lesions in them. Right dominance. Ascending aorta and aortic root of normal size. Genetic study: carrier of the variant p.Arg190Trp (chr1:156104248, c.568C>T) in exon 3 of the LMNA gene. Variant classified as probably pathogenic according to the criteria of the American College of Genetic Medicine (ACGM). Other history: haematology follow-up for FV and FVII deficiency, probably related to vitamin K deficiency. Home medication: bisoprolol 5 mg (1 tablet at breakfast and dinner), enalapril 5 mg (half a tablet at dinner), eplerenone 50 mg (1 tablet at lunch), furosemide 40 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), enoxaparin 60 mg (1 subcutaneous injection every 12 hours)  CURRENT ILLNESS Patient attended the hospital emergency department in the early hours of the morning accompanying her mother, who presented with febrile syndrome probably related to respiratory infection. While in the waiting room, she suddenly lost consciousness with loss of postural tone. On first medical contact (very early due to the patient's location), a pulse and spontaneous breathing were observed, but with a low level of consciousness; the patient was monitored and sustained ventricular tachycardia was observed, with several appropriate ICD shocks without achieving reversion to sinus rhythm, and degeneration of SMVT to ventricular fibrillation with effective shock, with subsequent reversion to sinus rhythm and recovery of the pulse. Following loss of pulse in sinus rhythm with electromechanical dissociation, advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were initiated for 18 minutes, including 3 ampoules of adrenaline, orotracheal intubation and initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation. Pulse recovery was achieved, but the patient remained in cardiogenic shock and required very high doses of vasoactive drugs.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure (BP) 60/38 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 75 bpm. Afebrile. Orotracheal intubation. Sedoanalgesia. Poorly perfused, with generalised lividity. Weak peripheral pulses, with slow capillary refill. Jugular venous pressure elevated. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: crackles up to bilateral midfields. Abdomen: soft, depressible, no masses or megaliths palpable. Hydro-aerial sounds present. Lower extremities: oedema with fovea in both pretibial regions. Pedial pulses not palpable.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: CBC: haemoglobin 15.2 g/dl, red cells 5.17 x10E6/μl, MCV 88.6 fl, MCH 29.4 pg, MCHC 33.2 g/dl, leucocytes 10.39 x10E3/μl, neutrophils (blood-%) 75.3%, neutrophils 7.83 x10E3/μl, lymphocytes (%) 20.9%, lymphocytes 2.17 x10E3/μl, monocytes (blood-%) 2.0%, monocytes 0.21 x10E3/μl, eosinophils (blood-%) 1.3%, basophils (blood-%) 0.5%, immature granulocytes % 5.20%, immature granulocytes # 0.54 x10E3/μl, platelets UPLAQ 191 x10E3/μl, VPM 10.9 fl. SR RDW coefficient of variation 15.2%, haematocrit 45.8%. Biochemistry: glucose 117 mg/dl, urea 37 mg/dl, creatinine 1.80 mg/d, sodium ion 138 mmol/l, plasma potassium ion 3.1 mmol/l, creatinine kinase 720 U/l, troponin T US 23 ng/dl, C-reactive protein 1.5 mg/dl. Coagulation: prothrombin time 17.10 seconds, prothrombin time (ratio) 1.53, prothrombin time (%) 54%. Partial thromboplastin time 30.60 seconds, derived fibrinogen 308, INR 1.53. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.30, pCO2 40 mmHg, pO2 95 mmHg, lactic acid 14.7 mmmol/l, EB -6.9 mmol/l, bicarbonate 19.4 mmol/l. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with left bundle branch block morphology, inferior axis and transition in V3-V4. ECG after initial stabilisation: sinus rhythm at 72 bpm. Normal PR interval. Right bundle branch block with secondary repolarisation abnormalities. QTc interval 450 ms by Bazett formula. Chest X-ray: portable, anterior-posterior (AP) projection. Increased cardiothoracic index. Bilateral vascular redistribution. Normopositioned single-chamber ICD. No obliteration of costophrenic sinuses.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in refractory cardiogenic shock after arrhythmic storm, with haemodynamic instability despite infusion of vasoactive drugs at very high doses, and electrical instability, with repeated episodes of SMVT and VF, which were controlled after perfusion of procainamide and sedoanalgesia with propofol. Subsequent evolution is poor. Neurologically with poor prognostic data: mydriatic pupils, isochoric arreactive. Absence of trunk reflexes. No response to stimulus. Haemodynamically in VVI pacemaker rhythm accelerated to 85 bpm, with procainamide in continuous perfusion, in maintained shock situation with NA at 1.6 mcg/kg/min. Cold. Poor general perfusion with hyperlactacidemia and metabolic acidosis maintained, evolving towards a situation of multi-organ dysfunction with oligoanuric renal failure and liver failure with hypoglycaemia and marked coagulopathy with PT of 28%. In our patient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered as a bridge to ablation or transplantation. However, the patient had a contraindication to heart transplantation at the time of admission, given his lack of adherence to treatment and previous check-ups. In addition, in a situation of refractory shock, multi-organ failure and a bleak neurological prognosis, it was decided, in agreement with the different units responsible, not to escalate treatment. Finally, he presented marked haemodynamic deterioration and died 24 hours after admission.   DIAGNOSIS Arrhythmic storm in a patient with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with LMNA gene mutation and severe biventricular dysfunction. Refractory cardiogenic shock secondary to arrhythmic storm. Postanoxic diffuse encephalopathy. Multi-organ failure. Death. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY Father died of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at the age of 54. Sporadic smoker for 5 years. Very occasional alcohol consumption. No hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia. No history of chest trauma or traffic accidents. No previously known cardiopathies. She consulted the emergency department 4 years ago due to sudden chest pain radiating to the jaw. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme serum tests were normal. Non-specific low back pain. No usual medical treatment.  CURRENT ILLNESS A 32-year-old man consulted the cardiology department due to episodes of central thoracic pain radiating to the left upper limb and cervical region, of years of evolution. At the beginning, the pain occurred with heavy exertion, but in recent weeks it increased in frequency and the exercise threshold for its onset was reduced. The pain does not change with postural changes and does not subside after taking paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She denies associated dyspnoea, no syncope or presyncope. His primary care doctor detected a panfocal murmur on auscultation and referred him to our clinic for further investigation.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Normoconstituted. Blood pressure 130/70. Heart rate 90 bpm. O2 saturation 99% breathing room air. Mild jugular engorgement. Jumping heart tones, aortic murmur systolic III/VI and diastolic III/IV. Good bilateral vesicular murmur. Peripheral pulses preserved and symmetrical. No congestive data.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Chest X-ray 4 years earlier: normal cardiothoracic index. No abnormalities in the cardiac silhouette. Chest X-ray in the emergency department: postero-anterior projection, with marked mediastinal widening. Electrocardiogram (ECG) in consultation: sinus rhythm 80 bpm, left axis, signs of LV enlargement with sharp T waves in precordial leads. Q wave in V5-V6. Transthoracic echocardiogram in consultation: LV globular, hypertrabeculated and dilated with LVEDDVI 67 mm, mild LV hypertrophy of 13-14 mm, slightly depressed systolic function (LVEF 45%). LA normal. Normal right chambers. Large aortic aneurysm, with a maximum diameter of 10 cm in the ascending section, rest of the vessel not visible. Trivalve aortic valve with severe functional aortic insufficiency due to loss of morphology of the sinotubular junction. Rest of valves normal. Pericardium without effusion. Urgent laboratory tests: no pathological values. Serial troponin T hs negative (< 0.014 μg/l). D-dimer 0.5 μg/ml. Thoracic-abdominal CT angiography (urgent) (images 5-10): ascending aortic aneurysm and AoAD type A with an entry portal in the anterior wall of the aortic root, extending into the abdominal aorta. The aneurysm has a maximum diameter of 11 cm. In the ascending aorta, the existence of an intimal flap in the anterior margin of the aortic root is observed above the valvular ring, in relation to type A aortic dissection. The origin of the right coronary artery arises from the lumen of smaller calibre, which is the true lumen. As for the coronary tree, a normal origin is seen with the right coronary artery (RCA) arising just at the limit of the beginning of the dilatation of the aorta. As for the supra-aortic trunks, involvement of the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery. In the study of the abdominal aorta, the left main renal artery and the inferior mesenteric artery arise from the small lumen, the true lumen. The dissection ends before the aortic bifurcation. Angio-CT chest at 3 weeks: dilated cardiomyopathy with significant increase in the cross-sectional diameter of the left ventricular cavity. No notable alterations were observed in the valved tube; there were no gross alterations in the coronary arteries or signs of periprosthetic leakage. Likewise, no significant alterations were identified in the stent placed in the true lumen of the proximal segment of the descending aorta. No collapse or thrombosis was observed. Images of dissection persist below the stent and in the segment adjacent to the stent the false lumen is only partially filled with contrast, either due to partial thrombosis or because it has not had time to fill with contrast during image acquisition. There is no evidence of dissection in the supra-aortic trunks, although there are some linear images, especially in the left common carotid artery, which in principle seem to be artefacts of the high concentration of contrast in the innominate vein. There is a significant bilateral pleural effusion that does not average high density to think it is a haemothorax. Conclusions: Postoperative changes as described in the commentary. Significant bilateral pleural effusion. Post-surgical echocardiogram (3 months after surgery): very globular, hypertrabeculated and dilated LV with LVEDD 77 mm, (even more than before surgery) severely depressed LVEF estimated at 20% with overall hypocontractility. Valved aortic tube with criteria of prosthetic normofunctioning and low gradients (max 16, mean 10 mmHg). Signs of low LVOT output (IVT < 10 cm). Mild-moderate functional mitral regurgitation. Rest of valves normal. Pericardium without effusion. Angio-CT of thoracoabdominal aorta post-surgery (10 months): ascending valved tube and trifurcated in patent arch, without images of periprosthetic leaks or other notable alterations. Aortic valve prosthesis. The endovascular prosthesis in the descending aorta is adequately distended, patent, and does not present images suggestive of kinking, migration, endoleaks or other complications. Chronic AoD in the descending thoracic aorta distal to the prosthesis and in the abdominal aorta, with both lumens patent. Maximum diameter (including both lumens) of 50 mm. Rest unchanged. Known dilated cardiomyopathy. No pleural or pericardial effusion identified. Pacemaker in left anterosuperior chest wall with catheter ends in right cavities. Conclusion: AoD treated surgically and endovascularly, with no signs of complications or changes with respect to the previous study. Follow-up echocardiogram (16 months after surgery): LV not dilated, with DTD of 42 mm, with moderate concentric hypertrophy of its walls of 15 mm overall thickness. Preserved LVEF, calculated at 66% by biplane Simpson with no alterations in segmental contractility. Mitral filling with altered relaxation pattern without diastolic dysfunction criteria. Left atrium (LA) of 39 mm transverse diameter. Right chambers of normal dimensions. Right ventricular (RV) systolic function preserved. Ascending aorta tube 24 mm. 40 mm abdominal aorta. Mechanical aortic prosthesis in aortic position with normal appearance, slightly elevated antegrade gradients with Vmax of 3.2 m/s and mean gradient of 22 mmHg, but with a V1/V2 of 0.35 (IVT in LVOT of 25 cm). A very mild periprosthetic insufficiency jet is seen at 1 hour in parasternal short axis. Structural appearance and normal function of the mitral valve. No tricuspid insufficiency, low probability of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic test: no pathogenic mutations found.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The ultrasound findings in consultation were more suggestive of a chronic course of an aneurysm than of AoD as the initial problem. However, the clinical manifestations of chest pain made it necessary to rule out this pathology. He was referred to the emergency department to be assessed by angio-CT to rule out dissection and, if there was no dissection, to schedule cardiac surgery as a priority, given that with such dimensions the risk of aortic rupture was high. On arrival at the emergency department, a chest X-ray was performed showing mediastinal widening not present in the previous X-ray performed in 2010. An angio-CT scan confirmed the dilatation of the ascending aorta and showed the presence of Stanford type A A AoD with an entry point in the anterior wall of the aortic root. The patient was referred to the cardiovascular surgery referral centre for urgent surgery and the aortic root was replaced with a valved tube using the Bono-Bentall technique with coronary artery reimplantation and stenting of the descending aorta. Postoperatively, left recurrential paralysis with secondary aphonia was observed. Three days after discharge, the patient was admitted to the emergency department for mechanical chest pain and self-limited loss of consciousness. A thoraco-abdominal CT angiography was performed and, apart from the surgical changes considered to be within the expected range, a significant bilateral pleural effusion was described which was considered to be secondary to the operation and which resolved with the passing of days. A cranial CAT scan was also performed, which was normal. Post-surgical echocardiogram showed a dilated and globular LV with severe systolic dysfunction. After 3 months, with optimal medical treatment, severe dysfunction with New York Heart Association (NHYA) functional class II-III was maintained, so it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention. During subsequent follow-up while maintaining optimal medical treatment, at 16 months he presented a reduction in LV volumes and LVEF recovery to normal ranges. The patient is able to perform moderate exertion and only suffers from back discomfort that forces him to stand intermittently. A striking fact was that in the subsequent follow-up his sister presented with a very extensive type B aortic dissection, complicated and requiring urgent surgical intervention. A genetic study was requested and no pathogenic mutations associated with aortic pathology or connective tissue disease were detected. Simultaneous follow-up by cardiovascular surgery, periodic monitoring of the descending thoracic aorta by angio-CT was requested (stable size of the descending thoracic aorta of 5 cm with a patent false lumen). Current treatment: aldocumar, omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours, ramipril 5 mg at breakfast and 2.5 mg at dinner, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 hours, spironolactone 25 mg/24 hours, lorazepam 1 mg/24 hours.  DIAGNOSIS 11 cm dissecting aortic aneurysm with Stanford type A dissection. Emergent surgical intervention by aortic replacement and valve replacement. Severe postoperative LV dilatation and dysfunction, which reversed after optimal medical treatment. ICD carrier in primary prevention. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 68-year-old woman, with no medical or surgical history of interest, was referred to the emergency department of our hospital for oppressive central thoracic pain. The patient denies known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors include obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus on metformin. She has no family history of early ischaemic heart disease or sudden cardiovascular death. Previously asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view, on the day of admission, during an intense discussion in the neighbourhood, she reported the onset of oppressive central thoracic pain, radiating to the back and left upper limb, lasting approximately 45 minutes, for which she alerted the emergency services, who transferred her to the emergency department of our hospital. At our assessment, she persisted with central thoracic pain of similar intensity, with no significant improvement after nitrates. The patient denied other accompanying symptoms (no associated vegetative cortex, dizziness or dyspnoea). On physical examination, the patient was in relatively good general condition, eupneic at rest (baseline sats O2 100%), well perfused, with blood pressure around 180/83 mmHg, heart rate 45 bpm. Cardiac auscultation is rhythmic, with no audible murmurs. No evidence of congestion (normal jugular venous pressure, preserved vesicular murmur without added noise, lower extremities without oedema), and with preserved pulses at all levels.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on admission: complete atrioventricular block (AVB) with wide QRS leak with morphology of left bundle branch block (LBBB) at 50 bpm. Repolarisation consistent with LBBB. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, with no evidence of pulmonary congestion or other pathological findings. Laboratory tests on admission: haemogram: leucocytes 6,600/μl, haemoglobin 12.2 g/dl, platelets 227,000/μl. Coagulation: INR 1, PT 100%. Biochemistry: glucose 164 mg/dl, urea 31 mg/dl, creatinine 0.89 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate 67 ml/min/1.73 m2, sodium 143 mEq/dl, potassium 3.5 mEq/dl, proBNP 3,664 pg/ml (at discharge 314 pg/ml). Peak myocardial damage markers: CK 193 (10-195 IU/l), troponin US 194.8 (0-13 ng/l). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) (videos 1-5): left ventricle not hypertrophic and size at the high limit of normal (LVEDD 52 mm, IVS 11 mm, PP 9 mm). Mid-apical septal akinesia, mid-apical lateral, mid-apical anterior and the rest of the apical segments, with hypercontractility of the bases and moderately depressed global systolic function (EF 35%). Right ventricle of normal size and function (TAPSE 21 mm, S wave 0.14 m/s). Mitral valve with sclerosed leaflets and mild insufficiency. Conclusion: segmental alterations compatible with transient apical dyskinesia syndrome, with moderately depressed systolic dysfunction. Emergent haemodynamic study: 1-vessel coronary artery disease due to severe stenosis of small diagonal 1a, with the rest of the vessels without significant lesions (moderate stenosis in the middle third of the anterior descending artery). Ventriculography was performed, showing a dilated ventricular chamber, with akinesia of the apical segments and hypercontractility of the basal segments, suggestive of tako-tsubo syndrome. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): normal sized left ventricle (53 mm) with akinesia of the apical anterior wall, apical inferior wall and apical septum. Hypokinesia of the basal and medial inferior wall. Oedema of the mid septum, mid anterior, apical segments except lateral wall and LV apex. No areas of hypoperfusion or late enhancement are identified. LVEF 52%. LV-DVT: 91mL. LV-STV: 44mL. LV-LV: 47mL. Right ventricle of normal size with no abnormalities in contractility and preserved morphology. Atria of normal size. Conclusion: study compatible with clinical suspicion of tako-tsubo syndrome.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In view of the clinical manifestations and the alterations in the electrocardiogram, the patient was admitted to the coronary unit of our department to complete studies and initiate therapeutic measures. An echocardiogram was performed which showed segmental alterations compatible with transient apical dyskinesia syndrome, with moderately depressed systolic dysfunction (LVEF 35%), and it was decided to perform an emergent haemodynamic study which described 1-vessel coronary artery disease due to severe stenosis of small diagonal 1a, with the rest of the vessels without significant lesions (moderate stenosis in the middle third of the anterior descending coronary artery). Ventriculography was performed, in which a dilated ventricular chamber was observed, with akinesia of the apical segments and hypercontractility of the basal segments, suggestive of tako-tsubo syndrome. In the following days, the studies were completed with a cardiac MRI consistent with the diagnosis of transient apical dyskinesia, in which an improvement in LV ejection fraction was observed. However, the patient persisted with complete AVB 1 week after her debut, so it was decided to implant a DDDR permanent pacemaker.  DIAGNOSIS Transient apical dyskinesia syndrome. LVEF 52% at discharge. Complete BAV with wide QRS escape rhythm. DDDR pacemaker implantation. 1-vessel coronary artery disease: significant stenosis of D1 (small calibre vessel). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  PERSONAL HISTORY 52-year-old male, ex-smoker of 10 cigarettes a day for the last 5 years, with no personal or family history of interest. He does not take any treatment.  CURRENT ILLNESS He presented at home with oppressive chest pain, continuous, with associated vegetative crusade. After about 10 hours with these symptoms, he suffered syncope, for which he finally consulted an external centre. An electrocardiogram showed complete atrioventricular block (AVB) with ST-segment elevation predominantly in DII-DIII and aVF. The infarction code was activated and immediate fibrinolysis was performed, starting antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel, according to local protocol. Subsequently, he was transferred urgently to our hospital, where persistent chest pain and ST-segment elevation were observed 90 minutes after fibrinolysis. Rescue angioplasty was performed, revealing generalised vasoconstriction of the left tree, with atheromatosis but without significant stenosis and a subtotal lesion in the middle third of the right coronary artery (RCA). After passing the guidewire through the culprit lesion, an image compatible with coronary dissection was observed, which was resolved by implanting three drug-eluting stents in the origin, middle and distal third of the right coronary artery (RCA), with acceptable angiographic results and good clinical response. After 72 hours in the intensive care unit (ICU), he was transferred to the hospital ward.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION General appearance was fair. Skin pallor. Dyspnoea on speech. SpO2 97% with oxygen therapy in nasal goggles at 2 l/min. Jugular ingurgitation present at 45o. Blood pressure 105/79 mmHg. Good capillary refill. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones at 95 bpm, no audible murmurs. Hypoventilation at both bases, no added sounds. Lower limbs without oedema or impaction. Peripheral pulses present.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Admission CBC: leukocytes 19630/mm3 with 79% neutrophils. Hb 14 g/dl. Platelets 293000. No alterations in the coagulation study. Glucose 183 mg/dl. Creatinine 1.1 mg/dl. Urea 44 mg/dl. Na+ 139 mEq/l. K 4.1 mEq/l. GGT 122 U/I. AST 339 U/I. Bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl. CK 3472 UI. cTnT-hs 3779 ng/l (normal values 0-14). Total cholesterol 155 mg/dl. Triglycerides 145 mg/dl. Urgent echocardiography on the ward: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with akinesia of the entire inferior wall and compensatory hyperkinesia of the anterior and lateral wall. Overall, there is mild LV dysfunction, with an estimated ejection fraction of 48%. Significant dilatation of the right chambers with very severe right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction (TAPSE 2 mm and S ́ tricuspid annulus 2.5 cm/s) and suggestive of increased central venous pressure. Acute tricuspid insufficiency with triangular morphology of its Doppler spectrum as a sign of severity and mild mitral insufficiency. Absence of pericardial effusion. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on the ward: sinus rhythm at 92 bpm, PR 134 ms. QRS 112 ms, lower QS with persistent ST elevated 1 mm in these leads and in V3-V4 with high voltage R in V2. QTc 442 ms. Coronary angiography (second procedure): Left coronary artery: after intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin, atheromatous arteries are observed, although without angiographically significant lesions. Right coronary artery: ostial occlusion. Some heterocoronary collaterals are observed retrogradely filling the more distal branches. Repermeabilisation was attempted with poor results, only a slight anterograde flow with a distal image of thrombus and residual dissection.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During his stay on the hospital ward, the patient presented unfavourable clinical data, with the development of symptoms and signs of acute right heart failure (HF). We performed an urgent echocardiography, which revealed very severe dilatation and dysfunction of the RV. Taking into account this evolution and knowing that the epicardial coronary flow, which was achieved in the first coronary angiography was TIMI II, it was decided to perform a new coronary angiography (96 hours after the first one), which showed a total occlusion of the RCA compatible with subacute thrombosis of the stent previously implanted at the ostial level, and repermeabilisation was attempted with poor results due to the presence of thrombus and residual dissection. After the procedure, he was admitted to the ICU, where an infusion of levosimendan was started. A few hours later, the patient presented with a marked drop in blood pressure, accompanied by a loud and intense holosystolic murmur on cardiac auscultation. A new bedside echocardiography was performed, showing a continuity solution in the interventricular septum at the lower basal level and a left-right shunt with a maximum gradient of 40 mmHg, compatible with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) as an acute mechanical complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In view of this situation, he was transferred to the transplant centre of reference to assess the implantation of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO). 12 hours after transfer, peripheral veno-arterial (V-A) femoral-femoral ECMO was implanted as a bridge to decision, maintaining continuous perfusion of dobutamine at 10 mcg/kg/min and noradrenaline at 0.5 mcg/kg/min. The patient required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. At a multidisciplinary meeting, given the impossibility of surgically treating the defect and the poor haemodynamic evolution, it was decided to include the patient in emergency 0 for cardiac transplantation. After 7 days of circulatory support with ECMO, an orthotopic heart transplant from a brain-dead donor was performed. Extracorporeal circulation was discontinued with peripheral V-A femoro-axillary ECMO due to haemodynamic lability and preoperative hypoxaemia. ECMO was withdrawn on the fourth day after transplantation, with good evolution. The patient was discharged after 67 days of hospitalisation.  DIAGNOSIS Inferior and right ventricular AMI. Ineffective fibrinolysis. Thrombotic occlusion of the RCA. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) complicated by coronary dissection. Implantation of three drug-eluting stents in RCA.

Ex-smoker until 2007, cumulative dose of 30 packs/year. Prostate carcinoma clinical stage T1c Nx Mx, treated with brachytherapy in 2014. Normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) test in last controls. Chronic ischaemic heart disease: In 2007 acute anterior myocardial infarction, treated with fibrinolysis without reperfusion and rescue angioplasty with conventional stent implantation over anterior descending (DA). 1-vessel coronary artery disease, with complete revascularisation. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% at discharge. In 2014, asymptomatic, he came for a check-up. Echocardiogram (ECG) with moderate LV systolic dysfunction at the expense of extensive segmental alteration in the LAD territory. Moderate dilatation of the left atrium. No significant valvulopathies. In 2016, she consulted for exertional dyspnoea class II of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) of 1 month's duration. His primary care physician detected unknown atrial fibrillation with left bundle branch block, which appeared to be frequency-dependent. He was referred to the emergency department, where he was started on oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban and the dose of beta-blocker was increased to optimise heart rate control. Home medication: omeprazole 20 mg/24 h, pravastatin 40 mg/24 h, bisoprolol 10 mg/24 h, ramipril 2.5 mg/12 h, rivaroxaban 15 mg/24 h (GFR 46 ml/min when prescribed, isosorbide mononitrate retard 50 mg/24 h, nitroglycerin s.l. which he did not require.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Subjectively well, no dyspnoea or chest pain with the activities he performs. She does not remember when the last episode of angina occurred, probably in 2007. No palpitations. No oedema. No orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. His wife states that he has greatly reduced his physical activity. He has stopped going out for walks. He acknowledges that he avoids stairs and slopes.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Weight 77 kg, height 1.70 m. Muscle mass index (BMI) 26.6 kg/m2. Blood pressure (BP) 130/70 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 60 bpm. O2 saturation (SatO2) 97% on room air. Eupneic at rest. Jugular venous pressure slightly elevated. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur.

Under bisoprolol 10 mg daily. Reaches 67% of maximum theoretical heart rate with a workload of 6.6 METs. Dyspnoea from the first stage, which increases and forces to suspend the test. Functional class II-III. Atrial fibrillation as baseline rhythm. No angina or significant ST alterations.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION An ECG was performed to check LV systolic function, which was currently severely depressed, and ergometry for an objective assessment of functional class, revealing dyspnoea that the patient minimised. Laboratory tests showed moderate renal insufficiency, poor control of diabetes mellitus and an altered iron profile. With all this, the treatment was adjusted and the patient was referred to a specific heart failure consultation. After a year of follow-up, with optimisation of medical treatment, improvement of LVEF to 32% was achieved; he persisted with limitation of his physical activity, in functional class II. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation was performed for primary prevention.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Old anterior infarction, single-vessel disease with complete revascularisation. Severe LV systolic dysfunction. No current angina. Chronic heart failure in NYHA functional class II-III. Permanent atrial fibrillation. Oral anticoagulation and heart rate (HR) control strategy. Chronic kidney disease, stage IIIb. Diabetes mellitus.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Male, 74 years old. No known drug allergies. Ex-smoker of one pack a day until 12 years ago. Diagnosed with arterial hypertension, currently being treated with olmesartan 20 mg, with good control of blood pressure. The patient consulted his primary care doctor for dyspnoea on moderate exertion. In addition, he has recently noticed frequent episodes of dizziness and blurred vision when walking, of very short duration, which disappear immediately when he stops walking. She has had no loss of consciousness or other cardiovascular symptoms. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed which showed atrioventricular conduction disorder with second-degree Wenckebach type block, and she was referred to our clinic. It was decided to extend the study with a 24-hour Holter, which showed bouts of 2:1 atrioventricular block (AVB) and nodal escape rhythm. In addition, transthoracic echocardiography was performed, which was found to be compatible with normality. During the test, complete AVB was observed, and he was admitted to cardiology with monitoring. Blood pressure: 150/53 mmHg. Heart rate: 32 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation with ambient air: 98%. Good general condition, conscious, oriented, cooperative, eupneic and afebrile. Jugular venous pressure not elevated. Rhythmic cardiac auscultation with systolic murmur in mitral and aortic focus II/VI. Pulmonary auscultation with normal vesicular murmur, without added noises. Abdomen soft, depressible, non-painful to deep palpation, without masses or visceromegaly. Positive and symmetrical peripheral pulses in all four extremities. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on admission: sinus activity at 60 beats per minute. Complete AVB with ventricular escape rhythm at 40 beats per minute, narrow QRS, without repolarisation alterations. ECG with pain: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. PR 220 ms. QRS stimulated by pacemaker. Concave ST elevation from V2 to V6 and in inferior leads, with a maximum of 4 mm in V4. ECG at discharge: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. Normal PR. QRS stimulated by pacemaker. ANALYSIS: haemoglobin 13.6 g/dl, haematocrit 40.1%, platelets 136,000/mm3, leukocytes 5,970/mm3 (normal formula). Coagulation: prothrombin rate 91%, INR 1.06, aPTT ratio 0.90. Biochemistry: glucose 91 mg/dl, urea 65 mg/dl, creatinine 1.16 mg/dl, sodium 138 mEq/l, potassium 5.1 mEq/l. Troponin I 3.37 ng/l, maximum peak 6.37 ng/ml (normal up to 0.06). THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: normal. At discharge, generator in left infraclavicular region. Electrodes in right atrium and ventricle. Transthoracic echocardiogram on admission: LV normal size with mild concentric hypertrophy (IVS 13 mm, DTD 53 mm, PP 11 mm). Normal global systolic function, without alterations of segmental contractility. Normal filling pattern for age with E/E" ratio of 9. RV of normal size and systolic function. Dilatation of both atria, severe left atrial dilatation (LA volume 67 ml/m2). No significant valvular heart disease. Inferior vena cava of normal size with adequate inspiratory collapse. Great vessels of normal calibre. Normal pericardium. Transthoracic echocardiogram during admission: akinesia of all middle and apical segments, with preserved contractility in basal segments, which conditions a moderately depressed systolic function (biplane LVEF 35%). Control transthoracic echocardiogram: normal systolic function (biplane LVEF 66%), with no alterations in segmental contractility. CARDIAC CATHETERISM: coronary arteries without significant lesions. Left ventricle with medioapical akinesia and moderate systolic dysfunction.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient attended an outpatient echocardiogram, referred from the outpatient clinic. Given the finding of paroxysms of complete AVB, which explained the dizziness and dyspnoea on exertion for which he consulted, he was informed and urgently admitted to the hospital ward with electrocardiographic monitoring. He was very nervous and worried. During his stay on the ward, he was found to be asymptomatic at rest, with complete AVB and heart rate below 30 bpm, so treatment was started with isoproterenol. The following morning, a permanent bicameral pacemaker was implanted without complications. That same afternoon, after implantation, the cardiologist on duty was notified due to severe oppressive central thoracic pain with associated vegetative cramping. An ECG was performed showing an anterolateral subepicardial lesion wave and an echocardiogram showing alterations in contractility in mid-apical segments with moderately depressed systolic function. Emergent coronary angiography was performed, showing coronary arteries without significant lesions and ventriculography compatible with tako-tsubo syndrome. After pain control, the patient showed good clinical evolution, with improvement of the alterations in segmental contractility and was discharged in a stable condition. Three months after discharge he remained asymptomatic, with a good appearance of the surgical wound and complete normalisation of the segmental alterations and ventricular function.  DIAGNOSIS Complete paroxysmal atrioventricular block. DDDR definitive pacemaker implantation. Post-procedural tako-tsubo syndrome. Psychological stress due to unplanned hospital admission and administration of isoproterenol as possible inducers. Transient moderate LV systolic dysfunction, at the expense of mid and apical segment akinesia. Coronary arteries without significant lesions. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is a 46-year-old male patient, unknown illness, with no history of drug addiction, with a 3-month subacute history of constitutional symptoms associated with hyporexia, asthenia and adynamia with involuntary weight loss of 8 kg. In addition, with evidence of quantified fever predominantly at night and progressive dyspnoea at rest associated with podalic oedema.  A transthoracic echocardiogram showed aortic endocarditis with a highly mobile aortic vegetation of 12 mm, severe aortic insufficiency, severe mitral insufficiency and congestive heart failure. A positive blood culture for penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus gallolyticus was documented, and antibiotic coverage was initiated. Among the laboratory studies, a computed axial tomography of the lumbar spine was performed, which showed hypodense areas in the spleen suggestive of infarction. In addition, a coronary catheterisation was performed, documenting an aneurysm in the right coronary artery of 8.3mm permeable, without lesions. The patient presented criteria for emergency surgery; however, due to the germ associated with this case, surgery was postponed in search of gastrointestinal neoplasia. On the eighth day of antibiotic treatment, the patient presented sudden deterioration of consciousness, the CT scan of the central nervous system showed right intraparenchymal haemorrhage, so he was taken to the operating room and a ruptured aneurysm of the right middle cerebral artery suggestive of mycotic aneurysm was documented, the haematoma was drained and clipped. The patient died two days after surgery. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: Patient aged 73 years. Allergy to penicillin. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): hypertension (HT), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Dyslipidaemia. Obesity. Neoplasia of the right breast in 2004, with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Cardiological history: under study due to clinical manifestations of exertional chest pain with angina-like features. In 2015, a stress echocardiogram was performed, which was inconclusive due to the low functional capacity obtained without reaching the theoretical submaximal frequency. The patient refused to undergo cardiac catheterisation. Treatment was started with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and nitroglycerin 5 mg patch.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Admitted to cardiology for presenting again with symptoms suggestive of progressive exertional angina. Usual New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II. No syncope or palpitations. No oedematization of the extremities. Good adherence to treatment. Due to the previous inconclusive stress echocardiography, it was decided to perform rest and stress SPECT, which was compatible with mild inducible ischaemia in the lower territory. It was decided to request cardiac catheterisation, which the patient finally accepted.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Eupneic at rest. Blood pressure (BP) 135/85 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 70 bpm. Oxygen saturation 98% basal. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normoventilation. Lower extremities: no oedema, distal pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, first degree atrioventricular block (AVB), incomplete left bundle branch block (LBBB). No changes in serial ECG. ANALYTICS: TnI 0.03, myoglobin 31.6. Glucose 106 mg/dl, urea 61 mg/dl, creatinine 1.03 mg/dl, uric acid 8.1 mg/dl, triglycerides 221 mg/dl, total cholesterol 143 mg/dl, HDL 33 mg/dl, LDL 66 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium 3.6 mEq/l, AST 35 U/L, ALT 31 U/L, GGT 47 U/L, FA 117 U/L, CK 40 U/L. Bi 0.48 mg/dl. Thyroid function: TSH 0.91 mIU/l, T4 1.02 ng/dl. Haemoglobin 13.4 g/dl, haematocrit 41%, MCV 90 fl, leucocytes 8900/mm3 (46% N), platelets 124000/mm3. HBa1C 7.9%. Chest X-ray: calcified atheromatosis of the aorta. Cardiomegaly. Hilar thickening of vascular appearance. No acute pleuroparenchymal alterations are observed. Dorsal spondylosis. Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle (LV) of normal size. Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with septal predominance. Normal global systolic function, without segmental asymmetries of contractility. Acceleration of flow in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) without significant dynamic gradient (maximum 10 mmHg) either at baseline or after Valsalva manoeuvres. Mild diastolic dysfunction with no current data of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Slightly dilated left atrium. Normal right chambers; right ventricle (RV) normocontractile (TAPSE 19 mm S-wave ́13). Mitral valve (MV): calcium in medial posterior annulus, thin leaflets, not limited in its opening, competent. Aortic valve (VAo): trivalve, mild sclerosis of leaflets, not limited in its opening, competent. Aortic root and visualised portion of proximal ascending aorta normal. Minimal end-systolic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) allowing estimation of normal systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPS). Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with normal inspiratory collapse. Normal estimated PAPS. Absence of pericardial effusion and intracavitary masses through this access route. Stress myocardial perfusion SPECT and synchronised resting myocardial perfusion SPECT: radiopharmaceutical: 99mTc-tetrofosmin. Dose: stress: 7.2mCi. Rest: 21.3mCi. Ergometry in Bruce protocol of 3.30 minutes duration ended due to inability to maintain the rhythm of the treadmill, reaching 86% of the heart rate predicted for age and BP max=130/80140/70. No chest pain. Decreased functional capacity (maximum load reached 5 METs). Absence of arrhythmias. In the low-dose SPECT/CT study, mild hypoperfusion of mild intensity was observed in the effort phase in the basal lower segment, which partially normalised in the rest phase and was compatible with mild inducible ischaemia. CORONARYGRAPHY: puncture of right radial artery 6F. Right dominance. Epicardial coronary arteries without significant angiographic stenosis. Multiple coronary fistulas to LV from all major coronary territories.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After the result of the cardiac catheterisation, treatment was started with low-dose bisoprolol, which was tolerated, and nitroglycerin and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) were maintained.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION In the cardiology ward he evolved favourably after starting treatment for heart failure (furosemide, ramipril, bisoprolol), remaining haemodynamically stable. A TTE study was completed, showing trivalve aortic valve with aneurysmal dilatation of the sinuses of Valsalva, severe aortic insufficiency, severely dilated LV with moderate systolic dysfunction (estimated LVEF 42%); CT angiography of the aorta showed dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, with aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta of normal calibre. For the aetiological study, autoimmunity was requested, which was negative, ruling out the possibility of vasculitis of large vessels (Takayasu). Likewise, in the presence of tall stature, long upper limbs, joint laxity, etc., with the suspicion of connective tissue.with the suspicion of connective tissue disease, tests were requested in search of this diagnosis, especially Marfan syndrome: acetabular X-ray without protrusion, sacral MRI which showed dural ectasia at lumbar and sacral level, ophthalmology consultation which ruled out ectopia lentis, presenting myopia; and even genetic study which remained pending on discharge (being subsequently confirmed with pathogenic mutation in the gene fibrillin 1 -FBN1- c.3656A>G [p.Tyr1219Cys]). In relation to the management of aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta with secondary aortic insufficiency, the case was discussed with cardiac surgery and the patient underwent surgery on 28/11/16. The aneurysm of the root and ascending aorta was resected and a Hemashield Platinum tubular prosthesis No 28 and No 34 with valve preservation according to David's technique (Miller's modification), as well as aortic valve plasty. Subsequent good evolution in the intensive care unit where she remained for two days, being discharged on the eleventh postoperative day with echocardiography at discharge showing well expanded tubular prostheses in the ascending aorta without alterations, severely dilated LV, severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction (LVEF 29%), aortic valve with postoperative changes and mild insufficiency, mild mitral insufficiency and mild pericardial effusion. During outpatient follow-up, she remained cardiovascular asymptomatic, functional class I, with upward titration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) and beta-blocker doses and improvement in LV function to LVEF 44% (see echocardiogram March 2017).  DIAGNOSIS MFS: carrier of pathogenic mutation in FBN1 (p.tyr1219cys). Aneurysm of ascending aorta and secondary severe aortic insufficiency. David's plasty and aortic tube. Secondary left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction, severe at discharge, currently moderate (LVEF 44%) with NYHA functional class I. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Admission to cardiology in July and November 2017 for HF related to dietary transgressions. In January 2018, a new decompensation. Severe right ventricular dysfunction was observed, forcing discontinuation of beta-blockers. Since then, frequency control with low doses of digoxin. Permanent AF anticoagulated with apixaban. Other personal history: chronic kidney disease of diabetic aetiology (glomerular filtration rate estimated at 40 ml/min), hyperuricaemia, depression and gonarthrosis. Situation and life at baseline: no cognitive impairment. Good baseline quality of life and adequate family support. Usual treatment: spironolactone 25 mg (1-0-0), furosemide 40 mg (2-0-0), sitagliptin 50 mg (1-0-0), lisinopril 20 mg (1-0-0), pantoprazole 40 mg (1-0-0), atorvastatin 20 mg (1-0-0), sertraline 50 mg (1-0-0), apixaban 5 mg (1-0-1), digoxin 0.25 mg (0.5-0-0), Monday to Friday.  CURRENT ILLNESS: She attends for progressive deterioration of functional class to minimal effort dyspnoea, with increasing orthopnoea of up to three pillows and episodes compatible with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND). Increased oedema in the lower limbs. She denies dietary and medication transgressions.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 139/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, oxygen saturation (SatO2) 96% with GN at 3l. Haemodynamically stable and eupneic at rest, with intolerance to decubitus. Jugular venous ingurgitation up to the angle of the jaw. Auscultation: arrhythmic without murmurs or extratonos. Hypoventilation and humid bibasal crackles. Abdomen: hepatomegaly of 2 traverses. Extremities: bilateral oedema with fovea up to two thirds of the legs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYSIS: haemoglobin 14.0 g/dl, platelets 207,000/μl, leucocytes 6,500/μl, INR 1.61. pH 7.45, pCO2 41 mmHg, bicarbonate 28 mmol/l, glucose 119 mg/dl, uric acid 8.3 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate eFG 40 ml/min/1.73 m2, sodium 142 mmol/l, potassium 4.6 mmol/l, NT-proBNP 8,505 ng/l. THORAX X-RAY: increased cardiothoracic index. Bilateral pinching of costophrenic sinuses. Enlarged hilae. Vascular redistribution.

Tricuspid valve with mild-to-moderate regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 50 mmHg. Dilated inferior vena cava without inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. Aortic root and ascending aorta not dilated.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was readmitted for new decompensation of HF after recent discharge. Intensive intravenous depletive treatment was started with a good initial response, rapidly achieving euvolemia, which was maintained after switching to oral diuretics. As this was a patient with chronic HF with depressed LVEF and frequent readmissions due to decompensation despite optimal medical treatment (in the last 6 months with adequate medical compliance), lisinopril was replaced during admission by sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg every 12 hours pending titration to optimal doses on an outpatient basis. The patient was last seen in the cardiology day hospital on 20 April 2018. In the 3 months she has been on sacubitril/valsartan, she has had no readmissions, remains in functional class II-III and on the initial dose of 24/26 mg every 12 hours due to a tendency towards low blood pressure. Renal function has remained stable (creatinine in the last control 1.5 mg/dl and potassium 4.6 mmol/l).  DIAGNOSIS Decompensated HF with American Heart Association (AHA) stage C reduced LVEF. New York Heart Association (NYHA) ambulatory functional class III. Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Percutaneous revascularisation of the LAD on two occasions. Probable pulmonary hypertension of Dana point groups 2 and 4. Severely depressed LVEF. Severe right ventricular dysfunction. Permanent non-valvular AF anticoagulated with apixaban.

ECG in the ED: AF with adequate ventricular response with ST elevation less than 1 mm in inferior and high lateral leads with high R in precordial leads. ECG in coronary ICU: sinus rhythm, lower Q waves with negative T waves (evolving pattern). Chest X-RAY PA: increased cardiothoracic index. Bilateral congestion with vascular redistribution to apexes. COMPUTER CAT SCAN (CT) chest-abdomen: image suggestive of posterobasal myocardial infarction in LV. Laminar pleural effusion predominantly on the right, reaching a maximum thickness of 15 mm. Hypodense cortical lesions in both kidneys, predominantly on the left, suggestive of renal infarction. Dorsolumbar spondylosis with stenosis of the L3-L4 and L4-L5 canal, to be correlated with clinical findings. Arterial DOPPLER ECOGRAPHY of MMII (performed on previous admission to the neurology department): severe stenosis in the right iliac artery and mild stenosis in the left iliac artery. Bilateral femoro-popliteal atheromatosis. ECHO-CARDIOGRAPHY: moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), inferior akinesia and lateral hypokinesia with preserved global contractility.

Calcified aortic valve disease: unquantified aortic stenosis with mean gradient of 22.5 mmHg.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION A 75-year-old male patient with the personal history described above was admitted for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with lower Q wave Killip I and acute ischaemia of the left lower limb. During admission, previously undiagnosed AF was detected. Treatment was started with double antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation. An angiographic study was performed showing a significant obstructive lesion due to distal thrombus in the first OM that was not revascularised. Given that the patient evolves favourably from the point of view of ischaemia of the left lower limb (mobilises fingers with good perfusion and presence of distal pulse) and without data of recurrence of myocardial ischaemia, discharge and follow-up by cardiology and vascular surgery consultations is decided.  DIAGNOSIS Acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation (STEACS) lower Killip I. Peripheral arterial disease: acute ischaemia of the left lower limb. Bilateral renal infarction.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: No known allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVR): ex-smoker for 17 years. Well-controlled arterial hypertension (AHT). Dyslipidaemia without medical treatment. Hyperuricaemia. Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) under treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Haematological history: polyglobulia with periodic bleeding. In September 2017: diagnosed with lymphocytic lymphoma with p53 gene deletion. Degenerative shoulder arthropathy and acromioclavicular osteophytosis assessed by traumatology and rehabilitation. Surgical interventions: inguinal hernia. Usual treatment: enalapril/HCTZ 20/12.5 (1-0-0), allopurinol 300 mg 0-1-0, omeprazole 20 mg 1-0-0. Preserved higher functions (SFB): independent for basic activities of daily living (BADL). Lives with his wife.  CURRENT ILLNESS: During the first visit, the patient reports feeling tired, with more asthenia than usual. However, he denies dyspnoea, both on exertion and at rest, orthopnoea, oliguria or oedema in the lower limbs. There was no history of chest pain or palpitations. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and a blood test and echocardiogram were requested to complete the study. Given the poor prognosis criteria associated with lymphocytic leukaemia, the haematology department decided to start treatment with ibrutinib (Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Approximately one month after starting treatment, the patient came to the emergency department with palpitations and a feeling of central thoracic oppression. On arrival, an ECG showed a common atrial flutter with ventricular response at 150 bpm. There were no signs of heart failure on physical examination or chest X-ray. Treatment with beta-blockers was administered and spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm after a few hours, and the patient was discharged and referred to outpatient cardio-oncohaematology consultations.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm, complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) with secondary repolarisation abnormalities. No acute repolarisation alterations. ANALYSIS: glucose 92 mg/dl, urea 117 mg/dl, creatinine 1.19 mg/dl, albumin 3.66 mg/dl, sodium 138 mmol/l, potassium 4.72 mmol/l, haemoglobin 12.4 g/dl, leukocytes 11,600 μL (N 68%), platelets 77000 μL. ECOCARDIOGRAM: left ventricle (LV) not dilated or hypertrophic, with preserved global and segmental systolic function. Sclerocalcified aortic valve without functional alterations. Sclerosed mitral valve with mild regurgitation. Left atrium (LA) slightly dilated. Right ventricle (RV) not dilated with good function. Tricuspid insufficiency (TI) was not detected. The pulmonary acceleration curve does not suggest significant pulmonary hypertension. IVC not dilated. No pericardial effusion. Emergency ECG: common atrial flutter with ventricular response at 150 bpm. Chest X-ray: enlarged cardiac silhouette. No costophrenic sinus impingement or other signs of heart failure.  CLINICAL COURSE After a first episode of atrial flutter, the patient met the criteria for anticoagulant treatment (CHA2DS2VASc: 3 due to age > 75 and hypertension), so treatment was started with rivaroxaban 15 mg, 1 tablet per day, and low-dose beta-blockers (bisoprolol 1.25 mg, 1 tablet per day). One month later, he presented a new episode of palpitations together with dyspnoea on exertion and went to the emergency department. This time the ECG showed atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response. It was decided to apply a rate control strategy by administering digoxin and a higher dose of beta-blocker (bisoprolol 5 mg). Once the heart rate had been controlled and there were no congestive symptoms, the patient was discharged with an earlier cardio-oncohaematology appointment. The patient was assessed one week later in the consultation room, where an ECG was performed showing sinus rhythm, so flecainide was started at low doses (50 mg at breakfast and 50 mg at dinner) and beta-blocker treatment was maintained (reducing the bisoprolol dose to 2.5 mg). Despite this treatment, the patient returned to the clinic 20 days later with palpitations of one week's duration, dyspnoea on medium exertion and oedema in the lower limbs. The ECG showed HF atrial flutter with ventricular response at 170 bpm, and the patient was admitted to the cardiology ward. During admission, treatment with flecainide was suspended and a heart rate control strategy was initiated with high-dose beta-blockers (bisoprolol 10 mg per day) and digoxin, spontaneously reverting to sinus rhythm. Diuretic treatment was also started, with a good response and disappearance of the congestive signs, and the patient was discharged a week later.  DIAGNOSIS AF - paroxysmal atrial flutter in the context of ibrutinib. Episode of HF atrial flutter after taking flecainide. Preserved biventricular function. Lymphocytic lymphoma in treatment with ibrutinib. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: Arterial hypertension. Dyslipidaemia. No known diabetes mellitus. Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI) evolved in December 2016. Due to refractory angina, scheduled percutaneous angioplasty was performed with implantation of a stent covered by a thrombotic occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery. Chronic under-occlusion of untreated first obtuse marginal (fine calibre vessel). Echocardiography at discharge showed a slightly dilated left ventricle (LV) with mild concentric hypertrophy and a large area of akinesia/dyskinesia in inferior and inferolateral segments with an image of a large pseudoaneurysm and abundant thrombotic material lining the walls of the pseudoaneurysm. Normal contractility of the rest and moderately depressed residual left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (40%). Discharged with triple therapy with acenocoumarol, without resolution of the intracavitary thrombus on echocardiography 6 months after discharge. Other pathologies: stage 3B chronic kidney disease. Fontaine grade IIb peripheral arterial disease. Alzheimer's type dementia. Current treatment: acenocoumarol, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/24 hours, bisoprolol 5 mg/24 hours, ramipril 2.5 mg/24 hours, furosemide 40 mg/24 hours, atorvastatin 80 mg/24 hours, omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours. Functional status: New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II. Moderate cognitive impairment. Bed-chair life. Family history: brother with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at 51 years of age.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Patient attended for a check-up of his ischaemic heart disease. No recurrence of angina, although her physical activity is very limited, she only reports dyspnoea with postural changes. No relevant bleeding under triple therapy, she discontinued clopidogrel one year after starting it.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Weight 78.0 kg. Height 165 cm. Blood pressure (BP) 98/56 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 67 bpm. Oxygen saturation (SatO2) 96%. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur (VCM) without pathological additions. Abdomen was nondescript. Lower extremities without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Normal pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Recent ANALYTICS: glucose 108 mg/dl, urea 32 mg/dl, creatinine 1.45 mg/dl, bilirubin 0.7. GOT 21.0. GPT 28.0 g/dl. Total cholesterol 155 mg/dl, triglycerides 123 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 43 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 98 mg/dl. Sodium 141 mEq/l, potassium 4.6 mEq/l. Haemoglobin 15.4 g/dl, haematocrit 44.5%, MCV 84.3 fl, platelets 237.0 10e3/ul, leucocytes 6.73 10e3/ul, HbA1c 5.6%. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) performed in consultations: sinus rhythm at 66 bpm, PR < 200 ms, QRS 110 ms, QRS 110 ms, Q wave in inferior derivations with ST supradelevation of up to 1.5 mm and negative inferolateral T wave. Recent echocardiography: inferior basal and posterior basal dyskinesia, akinesia of mid posterior septum. Hypokinesia of the medial lateral face. The described dyskinetic areas present an image of a large pseudoaneurysm with an image of thrombotic material inside. Normal contractility of the rest and moderately depressed residual LVEF that is not quantified by the presence of aneurysm, visually estimated at 35-40%. Slight valvular degenerative signs, with preserved opening. Left atrial dilatation. Slight pericardial effusion in the area adjacent to the posterior face, with no evidence of haemodynamic compromise. Inferior vena cava and suprahepatic vein not dilated, with adequate inspiratory collapse, which excludes the presence of significant systemic venous hypertension. CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE: a saccular image of approximately 4.8 x 4.4 cm communicating directly with the left ventricular cavity, showing an abrupt change in the contour of the LV wall, inferior and inferolateral basal location compatible with LV pseudoaneurysm. It shows a wide neck of 3.6 cm. In the gradient echo sequence with long TI (550 ms) after administration of IV contrast, a hypointense image with crescent morphology is seen in its interior, approximately 13 mm in maximum thickness, compatible with thrombus. Late enhancement sequences do not show hyperintense areas suggestive of necrotic myocardial wall-forming tissue. Moderate-severe LV dysfunction (LVEF 35%). Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the morphological findings described in the complementary tests, the possibility of surgical intervention of the pseudoaneurysm was considered. This option was finally rejected in consensus with the patient, given the high comorbidity and clinical stability since discharge (no episodes of decompensation due to heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias or recurrence of angina). Instead, a strategy of clinical follow-up and periodic imaging techniques was proposed to assess signs of progression or alarm. In this regard, during follow-up, the absence of resolution of the intraventricular thrombus was confirmed under adequate anticoagulant therapy (time in INR 2-3 range > 60%). Therefore, considering the low risk of embolisation given its morphological characteristics and the patient's high risk of bleeding, anticoagulant treatment was definitively withdrawn. Finally, ezetimibe 10 mg/24 hours was added to the treatment to try to achieve target LDL cholesterol concentrations (< 70 mg/dl).  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Advanced inferior STEACS. Revascularisation with drug-eluting stent to proximal right coronary artery. Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm with intracavitary thrombus image.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION BACKGROUND: Patient aged 44 years, with no drug allergies or medical history of interest. No consumption of toxic substances. No history of early ischaemic heart disease or sudden death in first-degree relatives.  CURRENT ILLNESS: The patient presented to the emergency department with retrosternal pain associated with vomiting of food, followed by presyncopal symptoms. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior face, so after administration of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 300 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg as a loading dose of double antiplatelet therapy, the infarction code was activated for urgent coronary angiography. This could not be performed due to the impossibility of channelling a peripheral arterial access (chronic occlusion of both radial arteries and both iliac arteries) so, given the impossibility of percutaneous intervention, fibrinolysis was performed with tenecteplase 6000 U iv. The patient showed no electrocardiographic evidence of reperfusion after fibrinolysis, although she remained asymptomatic. Her blood pressure remained low on non-invasive and peripheral monitoring during her admission. Echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 27%) with akinesia of all apical segments and severe hypokinesia of basal and mid anterior and basal and mid anteroseptal segments. After performing angio-CT and locating the level of vascular occlusions, vascular access to the right brachycephalic trunk was finally achieved by means of interventional radiology. Coronary angiography showed severe stenosis at the proximal-medial level of the anterior descending artery, where a drug-eluting stent was implanted. Given the case of a young patient with no cardiovascular risk factors and multiple occlusions of arterial trunks, a large vessel vasculitis (possibly Takayasu's disease) was suspected and treatment was started with methylprednisone 60 mg/24 hours and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/24 hours.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (right arm) 75/45 mmHg; blood pressure (left arm) 92/57 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 80 bpm. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic with systolic murmur II/VI in mitral focus. A murmur was also heard at the level of the right subclavian artery. Lower extremities: no oedema. No palpation of the pedial or tibial pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS SELF-IMMUNITY STUDY: ESR 88 mm; C-reactive protein 14.1 mg/dl. ANAs, ENAs, antiDNA, rheumatoid factor, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant, ANCAs: negative. The main serologies were also negative. MARKERS OF MYOCARDIAL DAMAGE peak: troponin T HS peak: > 10,000 ng/l. CK 8294 U/l; CKMB 1261 U/l. ECG on admission: RS at 90. ST elevation 6-7 mm in V2-V6, I and aVL. ST-segment depression in inferior face ECG at discharge: RS at 70 bpm. Q wave in V1-V3, I and aVL. Negative T wave in V2-V6, I and aVL. Echocardiogram at discharge: moderate depression of ejection fraction (LVEF 41%) due to anterior and mid-septal aneurysm and all apical segments with restrictive filling pattern and high diastolic pressures. Mild mitral insufficiency. ANGIO-CT of the aorta and supra-aortic trunks: 70% stenosis of the right brachiocephalic trunk. Stenosis of the right subclavian artery in its proximal section in 90%. Anatomical variant with a left common trunk that is 100% obstructed in the initial 2.5 mm long section. Atheromatosis in the aortic arch and descending thoracic artery. Complete obstruction of the vascular lumen in the infrarenal abdominal aorta proximal to the renal arteries and recanalisation in the primitive iliac arteries. CORONARYGRAPHY: severe stenosis in the middle anterior descending artery in bifurcation with diagonal branch. There is also diffuse atheromatosis at mid and distal level with moderate plaque at that level. Right coronary artery and circumflex without lesions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION She was discharged in good functional class with moderately depressed systolic dysfunction (LVEF 41%) at the expense of apical segments.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Q anterior. Takayasu's disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 26-year-old female patient, with no relevant past history, was admitted to the hospital from another institution with a fever of 39°C, arterial hypotension refractory to volume resuscitation, cutaneous hyperaesthesia. The condition had been interpreted as toxic shock, and she was blood cultured and antibiotic treatment was started prior to referral. On admission to the intensive care unit of our hospital, the patient was confused, tachycardic (120/min), hypotensive (70/40 mmHg) and afebrile. She had painful purpuric lesions on the palms, soles, subungual and periungual region, and on the palpebral conjunctiva, compatible with peripheral embolisms. No heart murmurs were heard. There were no other alterations on physical examination.  Laboratory tests on admission showed plateletopenia (39,000/mm3), 4500 leukocytes/mm3, low prothrombin time (58%) and parameters of Acute Renal Failure (elevated creatininemia). Urine sediment showed albuminuria, microscopic haematuria and granular casts. The rest of the analyses were within normal parameters (haematocrit, hepatogram, HIV negative, b-subunit negative). The fundus examination was normal. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and bilateral interstitial-alveolar infiltrate. The picture was interpreted as septic shock, blood cultures were performed (under antibiotics because he had received 1 dose of cefotaxime/ clindamycin/ amikacin) and treatment was started with cefotaxime/ clindamycin/ gentamicin, after consultation with Infectious Diseases.  On the second day of hospitalisation, the patient persisted with signs of heart failure on chest X-ray, adding bilateral infiltrates of the pulmonary oedema type and compatible semiology, for which a referral to the cardiology department was requested to perform a transthoracic echocardiogram where vegetation was observed in the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate left ventricular dysfunction. A diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made 24 hours after the patient's admission. Treatment with clindamycin was discontinued.  During her evolution, the patient's haemodynamics worsened, requiring inotropic drugs and her respiratory mechanics required non-invasive ventilation. After several days of antibiotic treatment she continued with febrile registers. A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed an image compatible with mitral annulus abscess. Due to the patient's haemodynamic instability, the cardiovascular surgery department decided not to perform surgery at that time. Four days after admission, the first blood cultures obtained were positive for Staphylococcus aureus, aminoglycosides were discontinued and Vancomycin was indicated.  The patient's haemodynamic and laboratory parameters improved, her renal insufficiency was reversed, the skin lesions disappeared, and after 16 days she was allowed to be transferred to Buenos Aires to continue antibiotic treatment and plan the surgical strategy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 38 year old male presented to the Emergency Department for dyspnoea.  HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION No family history of interest, no known allergies. Smoker of 10 cigarettes/day, occasional weekend drinker and sporadic ex-consumer of cocaine and marijuana. Does not take regular treatment. Patient with an active life, asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view until two months prior to admission, who began with progressive deterioration of functional class with dyspnoea on moderate exertion until becoming resting. For this reason, he came to the hospital one week prior to admission, with a predominantly nocturnal cough and intermittent mild pain in the anterior chest region, and was diagnosed with a possible respiratory tract infection. Antibiotic and corticoid treatment was prescribed. Since then, clinical worsening with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, orthopnoea of up to two pillows associated with oedema up to 2/3 in the lower limbs and weight gain in the last week. On arrival at the emergency department, BP 110/60. HR: 120 bpm. Basal SatO2: 97 %. Weight: 74 kg. Good general condition: well hydrated, well nourished and perfused, normal colour. Neck: no palpable lymph nodes or evidence of jugular engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: gallop rhythm by R3. Pulmonary auscultation: bibasal crackles in the lower third of both lung fields. Abdomen: RHA +, soft, depressible, not painful on deep or superficial palpation. Lower limbs: oedema up to the lower third of both lower limbs without fovea, peripheral pulses (+). No signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Complementary tests on admission ECG: sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm. Narrow QRS with unspecific repolarisation alterations (negative T waves in I, aVL and from V4 to V6). Haemogram: leucocytes 8,000. Hb 14.7 g/dl. Platelets 217,000/ul. Haemostasis: APTT: 31.3. PT: 12.8. INR: 1.11. Biochemistry: glucose 121 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.9 mg/dl. Albumin 3.6 g/dl. Calcium 8.6 mg/dl. GOT 29 U/l. GPT 50 U/l. CK 111. Troponin 0.09 ng/ml. Bilirubin 0,4 mg/dl. Amylase 44. Lipase 37. Na 144. K 4,2 mmol/l. Chlorine 109 mmol/l. GOT: 20 U/I GPT: 32 U/I GGT: 117U/I 4. BNP: 405 pg/ml. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.49, pCO2 27 mmHg, pO2 89 mmHg, HCO3 20 mmol/l. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. No parenchymal infiltrates. Vascular redistribution with evidence of CHF. Portable echocardiogram (Vscan): dilated LV with severe global systolic dysfunction with generalised hypokinesia and RV systolic dysfunction. Moderate MI. Severe TR. No pericardial effusion. In view of the findings, it was decided to admit him to the ward for treatment and to complete the study.  Complementary tests on the ward ECG: dilatation and severe LV dysfunction with LVEF around 15%. Restrictive filling with mild MI. Dilatation and dysfunction of the RV with PSAP around 55 mmHg. Biochemistry: TSH: 2.28. CRP: 3.4. Ferritin: 59 ng/ml. Vitamin B12: 464 ng /dl A. Folic: 5. HDL: 32 mg/dl. LDL: 99.4 mg/dl. Serology: anti HIV 1-2 (-). IgM anti CMV(-). EBV IgG(-). Toxoplasma IgG(-). IgG antiHBc(-). HCV(-). Catheterisation: coronary arteries without significant lesions. Chest X-ray (at discharge): cardiomegaly with no evidence of pulmonary congestion. Walking test (prior to discharge): 6-minute test was performed, covering 426 metres, finishing at 100-110 bpm and with a baseline saturation of 95%. Cardiac MRI (prior to discharge): dilated cardiomyopathy with severe LV and mild RV dysfunction. Mild MI and TR. No evidence of myocardial fibrosis.  EVOLUTION Treatment with beta-blockers, antialdosterone and ACE inhibitors was started on the hospital ward, and the latter had to be discontinued due to symptomatic arterial hypotension of up to 85/40 mmHg. During the first days of admission he required inotropic support with levosimendan and intravenous depletive treatment with diuretics, losing approximately 8 kg of weight since admission. He was monitored with telemetry during admission and only isolated ventricular extrasystoles were observed. A regular echocardiogram confirmed the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy with severe LV dysfunction, with no significant valvulopathy to justify it. In order to rule out coronary artery disease, coronary angiography was performed, ruling out coronary artery disease. Due to a tendency to sinus tachycardia with BP figures of 90-100/50-60 that prevented an increase in the dose of beta-blockers, it was decided to associate ivabradine, achieving a resting heart rate of around 70-80 bpm. With the aim of prognostic stratification and with a view to assessing myocardial fibrosis, MRI was performed, ruling it out, showing a slight improvement in LV (LVEF 25%) and RV function with respect to the initial echocardiographic study. Also for prognostic purposes, a walking test was performed prior to discharge, reaching more than 300 metres in 6 minutes and without desaturation. Given the stability and good clinical evolution, he was discharged pending the optimisation of pharmacological treatment on an outpatient basis in consultations, as well as early re-evaluation with the aim of considering an ICD if ventricular function did not improve.  DIAGNOSIS Congestive heart failure. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Severe LV dysfunction. Mild RV dysfunction. Coronary arteries without significant lesions. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 56-year-old male ex-smoker, with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertensive, dyslipidaemic, hyperuricaemic and obese, with peripheral arterial disease (bilateral femoropopliteal stenosis not requiring revascularisation after evaluation by vascular surgery) whose cardiological history was ischaemic heart disease in the dilated phase. In 2003 she had an anteroseptal fibrinolysis AMI and coronary angiography was not performed. A new posteroinferior AMI in 2005 with coronary angiography showed chronic occlusion of the middle anterior descending artery, 90% lesion in the posterolateral artery, 40% lesion in the proximal right coronary artery and 80% lesion in the obtuse marginal artery. Echocardiogram showed LVEF of 26%. Surgical revascularisation was performed with bypass of the internal mammary artery to the anterior descending artery, saphenous artery to the obtuse marginal artery and saphenous artery to the posterior descending artery. In 2013, a single-chamber defibrillator implant was indicated for primary prevention. Currently being monitored by Cardiology in NYHA functional class II. Usual treatment: carvedilol 12.5 mg every 12 hours, ivabradine 5 mg every 12 hours, enalapril 2.5 mg every 12 hours, furosemide 80 mg per day, omeprazole 20 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, ASA 100 mg, eplerenone 25 mg, allopurinol 300 mg, insulin lantus 40 units per day and insulin novorrapid. The patient came to the emergency department for progressive dyspnoea in recent weeks until he became resting, with three-pillow orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He also reported oedema in both legs and decreased diuresis. He did not report palpitations or chest pain. Physical examination showed blood pressure 145/70 mmHg, HR 80 beats/minute, BMI 41.2 kg/m2, baseline oxygen saturation 90 %, tachypnoea, and he was afebrile. He showed jugular ingurgitation up to the mandibular angle, moist crepitant rales up to midfields, rhythmic hypophonic tones with systolic murmur in mitral focus II/VI, a globular abdomen with no palpable megaliths, no signs of ascites and tibio-malleolar oedema with fovea up to the proximal third. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, blood tests showed: absence of anaemia, slightly impaired renal function, normal ions and mild elevation of cardiac biomarkers in plateau, and tristatic echocardiogram showed severe dilatation of the left ventricle, severely depressed LVEF and severe functional mitral regurgitation.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly at the expense of the left cavities, fluid in the medial cisure, vascular redistribution and perihilar alveolar-interstitial infiltrate.  Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 75 beats/minute, intraventricular conduction disorder with QRS of 170 ms, Q wave in aVL and secondary repolarisation disorders. CBC: leukocytes 8,600/mm3, haemoglobin 11.5 g/dl, MCV 86 mm3, MCH 28/cell, platelets 220.000/mm3, normal coagulation, creatinine 1.34 mg/dl, urea 50 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate 50 ml/min/1.73 m2, Na 137 mEq/L, K 4.5 mEq/L, CPK 130 IU/L, troponin I 0.8 ng/ml, NT pro BNP 9350 pg/mL, glycosylated haemoglobin 10 %. Echocardiogram: regular acoustic window. Severely dilated left ventricle. Very severely depressed LVEF (15 % by Simpson biplane) with impaired global contractility. Pseudonormal diastolic pattern with average E/e" of 15.6. Mitral valve with mild leaflet thickening and mild annular calcification. Severe central mitral regurgitation of functional origin predominantly with central tenthering. Contracted vein of 8 mm and ORE by PISA of 0.31 cm2. Normofunctioning aortic valve. Severely dilated left atrium. Moderately dilated right chambers with moderately depressed right ventricular systolic function with fractional shortening of 25%. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with PSAP of 60 mmHg. Pericardium without effusion. Inferior vena cava 22 mm with reduced inspiratory collapse. Coronary angiography: left common trunk without significant lesions. Anterior descending artery with moderate proximal diffuse atheromatosis and chronic occlusion of the middle portion, after origin of 1st diagonal being visible the distal vessel with severe diffuse atheromatosis by bypass of internal mammary to anterior descending artery. Circumflex with severe proximal lesion anterior to 1st obtuse marginal. Distal vessel of obtuse marginalis without significant lesions visible through patent saphenous bypass. Right coronary artery with chronic occlusion in middle portion. Chronically occluded right saphenous to coronary artery immediately after its origin. Adenosine SPECT: severe dilatation of the left ventricle with severe and extensive anterior hypoperfusion as well as moderate hypoperfusion in mid-basal segments of the inferolateral wall, all without significant changes in the study at rest.  EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to Cardiology and perfusion of furosemide and nitroglycerine was started, achieving negative water balance and clinical improvement, despite which dyspnoea persisted on minimal effort. Hygrotona was added and the dose of antialdosterone was increased to achieve resolution of the congestion. In addition, the remaining treatment for heart failure was titrated. Given the clinical deterioration of the patient, coronary angiography was performed, which showed patent bypasses from mammary to anterior descending and from saphenous to obtuse marginal 1a and very proximal occlusion of the saphenous bypass to the right coronary artery. This artery showed chronic occlusion in its middle segment, and was not considered to be susceptible to percutaneous treatment as a viability test was performed with SPECT, which showed no viability in this territory. He was discharged with 120 mg of furosemide per day, spironolactone 100 mg per day, hygrotona 50 mg every 48 hours, carvedilol 25 mg every 12 hours, ivabradine 7.5 mg every 12 hours, enalapril 2.5 mg every 12 hours, ASA, omeprazole, atorvastatin, allopurinol and insulin therapy. Based on the electrocardiographic findings, the clinical situation and the patient's LVEF, an upgrade to resynchronisation therapy was indicated. In this procedure, venography was performed, showing occlusion at various levels of the coronary sinus without identifying any practicable subsidiary vein. Only a middle cardiac vein independent of the coronary sinus was observed, which could not be cannulated despite the use of several subselectors and angioplasty guides, so cardiac resynchronisation therapy by percutaneous approach could not be performed. A few months later, he was readmitted due to decompensation of his heart failure related to a respiratory infection and was discharged with an increased dose of diuretic. Given the patient's age and NYHA functional class II-III, the patient was referred to a reference centre for evaluation for inclusion on the heart transplant waiting list. Right heart catheterisation was performed and showed a PCP of 30 mmHg, mean PAP of 34 mmHg, PVR 2.6 uW and cardiac output of 2.6 L/min, and ergospirometry showed a peak oxygen consumption of 14 ml/kg/min. Due to comorbidities, poorly controlled diabetes, obesity and peripheral arterial disease, he was not considered a candidate for heart transplantation. On outpatient follow-up, the patient maintained NYHA functional class II-III with NT-proBNP of 4350 pg/mL. It was decided to switch from enalapril to sacubritil/valsartan 49/51 mm every 12 hours after the 36-hour washout period. After one week of treatment and without worsening renal and ion function, the dose was titrated to 97/103 mg every 12 hours. The patient reported significant clinical improvement after this medication change and diuretic dose reduction was possible. As resynchronisation therapy was not possible due to the unfavourable anatomy of the cardiac veins, the possibility of electrode implantation in the epicardium of the left ventricle by cardiac surgery was offered. With the clinical improvement after the introduction of sacubritil/valsartan, the patient decided to postpone this intervention. On the other hand, the patient had severe functional mitral regurgitation and occlusion of the right saphenous-coronary bypass. At the medical-surgical session, he was not considered a candidate for mitral repair and a new coronary artery bypass given the lack of viability of the lower territory, obesity and surgical risk. However, the possibility of Mitraclip implantation for treatment of mitral insufficiency was offered. Given the patient's symptomatic improvement with the change from ACE inhibitors to sacubitril/valsartan, this therapeutic option has not been implemented for the time being.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure with reduced EF. Ischaemic heart disease in dilated phase with severely depressed systolic function. Severe functional mitral regurgitation. Severe three-vessel coronary artery disease with occlusion of saphenous to right coronary artery bypass and permeable mammary to anterior descending and saphenous to first obtuse marginal bypass.  Secondary diagnoses: Insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus. Arterial hypertension. Dyslipidaemia. Grade 2 obesity. Chronic lower limb ischaemia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Normal right chambers with preserved right ventricular systolic function.   EVOLUTION Patient diagnosed with breast carcinoma of non-special histological subtype. Segmentectomy and lymph node removal was performed in December 2016. After assessment by Oncology, the first cycle of chemotherapy with FEC (5-fluorouracil + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide) was started at the beginning of February 2017. One week later, she presented with an episode of prolonged chest pain with mobilisation markers of myocardial damage, electrocardiographic changes and severe left ventricular dysfunction not present in the previous echocardiogram. Coronary angiography was performed without evidence of coronary artery disease. Suspicion of acute toxic myocarditis was suspected and cardiac MRI was performed, which was finally ruled out. The patient had a good clinical evolution, with no new episodes of chest pain or signs of heart failure, and was discharged from hospital with the following treatment: bisoprolol 5 mg c/12 h, ramipril 2.5 mg c/24 h, eplerrenone 25 mg c/24 h, atorvastatin 40 mg c/24 h, esomeprazole 20 mg c/24 h. After discharge from hospital, she was reviewed in Oncology and the next scheduled cycles of chemotherapy with FEC were suspended due to the existence of acute cardiotoxicity after the first cycle. Four weeks later she was assessed in the outpatient cardiology department and the echocardiogram was repeated with an improvement in LVEF.  DIAGNOSIS Cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction induced by acute cardiotoxicity after starting chemotherapy treatment (5-FU + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide). NYHA functional class I/IV. Infiltrating breast carcinoma of non-special histological subtype. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 58-year-old male, ex-smoker, ex-drinker and overweight, with a history of ischaemic stroke of unidentified aetiology in 2015 in the middle cerebral artery with motor aphasia as the main sequelae. The echocardiogram performed on admission showed slight dilatation of the right ventricle with hypertrabeculation and left ventricular ejection fraction at the lower limit of normality as the only relevant findings. The patient was awaiting outpatient cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to complete the study.  Usual treatment: ASA 100 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg and ranitidine 300 mg every 24 hours. The patient presented at home with sudden dyspnoea and general malaise, so he called the Emergency Services who performed an electrocardiogram that showed regular wide QRS tachycardia at 205 beats per minute with an image of left bundle branch block and right superior axis. Given that the patient presented acceptable clinical tolerance, iv amiodarone was started and subsequently, given the lack of response, electrical cardioversion was performed and the patient was transferred to our centre in sinus rhythm, maintaining haemodynamic stability and with symptomatic improvement. At our centre, he was admitted to the Coronary Unit, where amiodarone perfusion and low-dose bisoprolol treatment were started, despite which he presented another episode of tachycardia similar to the one described, which required electrical cardioversion. He did not report chest pain or syncope or any other symptoms in the anamnesis. Physical examination showed blood pressure 95/60 mmHg, 80 beats/minute, BMI 28 kg/m2, baseline oxygen saturation 93 %, and he was afebrile. There was no evidence of jugular ingurgitation. Cardiopulmonary auscultation showed no heart murmurs and preserved vesicular murmur with no added sounds. Abdomen without masses or megaliths and lower limbs without oedema. Chest X-ray, blood tests showed no anaemia, normal renal function and ions, and mild elevation of cardiac biomarkers. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild left ventricular and severe right ventricular dilatation, severely depressed LVEF and severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram 1: regular wide QRS tachycardia at 205 bpm with atrioventricular dissociation, left bundle branch block image morphology and right superior axis. Electrocardiogram 2: sinus bradycardia at 55 bpm, PR 220 ms (first degree BAV), small voltage r wave up to V6 and positive deflection at the end of QRS in V1 compatible with epsilon wave, negative T waves from V1 to V5 and flattened in V6 and frontal leads. Portable chest X-ray: cardiomegaly and vascular redistribution, without pleural effusion. CBC: leukocytes 7500 / mm3, haemoglobin 14.5 g/dl, MCV 85 mm3 , MCH 33 / cell, platelets 225,000 / mm3, normal coagulation, creatinine 1.05 mg/dl, urea 30 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate 74 ml/min/1.73 m2, Na 138 mEq/L, K 4.6 mEq/L, CPK 210 IU/L, troponin I 0.7 ng/ml (peak). Transthoracic echocardiogram: poor acoustic window in apical window. Left ventricle slightly dilated (DDVI 59 mm). Severely depressed LVEF (25% by Teicholz) with decreased global contractility. Prolonged diastolic relaxation pattern and mean E/e" of 11. Normofunctioning mitral valve and aortic valve. Slightly dilated left atrium. Severely dilated right chambers. Parasternal long axis RVOT diameter 52 mm, parasternal short axis 52 mm. RV free wall hypertrabeculation and depressed systolic function with TAPSE of 12.9 mm. No adequate recording of tricuspid registry for PSAP estimation. Absence of pericardial effusion, inferior vena cava 21 mm with inspiratory collapse less than 50%. Coronary angiography: angiographically normal coronary arteries. Cardio MRI: RA 67 x 55 mm (36 cm2), RV 100 x 70 x 60 mm, LA: 66 x 38 mm, LV: 58 x 58 x 66 mm, IVS thickness 11 mm, RVOT 55 mm. Left ventricular function study: LVEF 44 %, Beat volume 36.5 ml/m2, cardiac output 4.8 l/m, TVD 83.8 ml/ m2, STV 47.3 ml/m2. Right ventricular function study: LVEF 15 %, stroke volume 24.6 ml/m2, cardiac output 3.3 l/min, VTD 165.5 ml/m2, VTS 141.9 ml/m2. Great dilatation of the right ventricle with areas of anteroinferior hypokinesia of 2 cm close to the valvular plane. At the level of the left ventricle there is a thinned, irregular lateral face, with probable fatty infiltration, presenting a small aneurysmal dilatation of 15 mm in the middle inferolateral segment. Middle inferolateral akinesia and apicolateral dyskinesia. Lateral fat replacement. After contrast iv enhancement is seen throughout the subepicardial lateral wall of the thinned LV and inferolateral segment in addition to anterior, inferior basal and right ventricular outflow tract areas.  EVOLUTION The patient presented two more episodes of ventricular tachycardia under treatment with amiodarone requiring electrical cardioversion. He was switched to treatment with sotalol, achieving electrical and clinical stability. Based on clinical, electrocardiographic and cardiac imaging findings, a diagnosis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right and left ventricle was established. A bicameral bibovine ICD was implanted as secondary prevention with an electrode terminal placed in the middle septum without complications. Subsequent evolution was favourable, with no new episodes or defibrillator shocks. Treatment was started with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor together with low-dose bisoprolol and sotalol and, given the previous cerebrovascular event, it was decided, in conjunction with neurology, to start treatment with apixaban due to the likelihood of cardioembolic aetiology. There were no known cases of this condition in the family, so genetic testing was requested (results pending).  DIAGNOSIS Sustained ventricular tachycardia in a patient with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right and left ventricle. Severe right and moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction. First degree AVB, arterial hypertension. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 57-year-old patient with CVRF and a history of anterior and apical AMI in 1997 with surgical revascularisation with VSF-DA and VSF-CD bypass. The patient was being monitored by the Cardiology department with CF NYHA I-II. After observing NSVT on Holter monitoring, it was decided to perform EPS with induction of polymorphic VT. A programmed single-chamber ICD was implanted in 2003 with a therapy zone starting at 200 bpm. In the last control echocardiogram: severely dilated LV, with severely depressed systolic function (25%) and anteroseptal and apical akinesia. Given the presence of LVEF < 35 %, CF NYHA II, QRS 160 ms (BRD+HBAS) with adequate medical treatment, it was decided to upgrade to ICD with cardiac resynchronisation therapy (ICD-CRT) on an outpatient basis. The patient was admitted to our department for the procedure. The procedure was carried out with implantation of a tetrapolar electrode in the left lateral vein (very difficult access due to the ostimum valve in the coronary sinus) and an electrode in the right atrial appendage. Programming optimisation was performed and DDDR 45 was finally programmed, Biv +30 ms with 3-shell ring pacing, resulting in a stimulated QRS of 128 ms. A few hours after implantation, the patient presented sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at 160 bpm with inferior axis and QS morphology in precordial leads with good haemodynamic tolerance. Treatment was started with amioradone and intravenous beta-blocker, reprogramming the device to therapy from 140 bpm (previously programmed from 200 bpm). An attempt was made at ATP and after sedation with midazolam and etomidate, two attempts were made at internal CV with ICD and two more attempts with external defibrillator which were not effective. Finally, it was during anaesthetic induction with propofol that the patient reverted to sinus rhythm.  Physical examination: BP 110/57 mmHg, HR 160 bpm, T 36.4 oC, baseline SatO2 95%. Patient conscious and oriented, normohydrated and normal colour. Mild tachypnoea. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normoventilation.

No oedema in the lower extremities or signs of DVT.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV severely dilated (LVEDD 74 mm). Severely depressed LVEF (estimated by Simpson 25%). Akinesia with septal and apical hyperenhancement with an impression of eschar. Atria of normal size. MV: mild calcification of the posterior mitral annulus with mild MR. VAo: trivalva with mild sclerosis of the sigmoid valve without restricting its opening. RV of normal size and function. Mild TR with RV-AD gradient of 25 mmHg.

EVOLUTION After the patient went into sinus rhythm, he was admitted to the Coronary Unit for monitoring and treatment. The case was discussed with the Arrhythmia Unit of our hospital and VT ablation was decided. Using the CARTO 3 navigation system, an anatomical reconstruction and LV voltage mapping was performed, identifying a dense anteroseptal and apical scar with late potentials (LP) at its edges. The pacemapping was very similar to the clinical VT. It is noteworthy after different radiological projections that this area was close to the location of ring 3 of the LV pacing electrode, which was programmed with ring 3-shell pacing. The LPs were abolished by radiofrequency (RF) application. Subsequently, pacing manoeuvres were performed from RV and LV, without tachycardia induction. Finally, LV bipolar pacing was reprogrammed from ring 1-2 (area furthest from the scar). Based on these data, it was concluded that we were dealing with a possible case of proarrhythmia after cardiac resynchronisation. The patient was discharged from hospital, stable and asymptomatic with no new arrhythmic events. He is being monitored by the Arrhythmia Unit and the Heart Failure Unit of our Department.  DIAGNOSIS Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia possibly induced after cardiac resynchronisation therapy in a patient with ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severely depressed systolic function. Radiofrequency ablation of ischaemic VT substrate. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 65-year-old man with no medical history of interest except for dyslipidaemia controlled by means of hygienic-dietary measures. Non-smoker and moderate drinker. He leads an active life, independent in terms of ADLs. He reports a clinical history of approximately one month of moderate exertion dyspnoea together with episodes of palpitations and chest pain in the last two weeks. The previous night she had presented incessant palpitations and consulted her primary care physician. On arrival at the outpatient clinic, an ECG was performed showing a regular tachycardia with wide QRS at 180lpm. The patient was haemodynamically stable with a slight feeling of dizziness. The patient was transferred to hospital and an amiodarone infusion was started, but was not effective in reverting to sinus rhythm. The patient began to become hypotensive and a CVE at 100J was performed, leaving in SR after shock. On arrival at the Emergency Department, the patient was stable, somewhat hypotensive, with an unremarkable physical examination, with no signs of HF on examination, and reported to be asymptomatic at that time.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Outpatient ECG: regular tachycardia with wide QRS at 180lpm, BRDHH image with concordance in precordial and inferior axis ECG on arrival at the ED: sinus rhythm at about 65lpm, axis at -30o, BAV 1st degree (PR 280 msg), narrow QRS, abundant VE of different morphologies, some of the same morphology as VT but others of different ventricular focus. CBC on admission: arterial ABE: PO2 140.0 mmHg [75-95], PCO2 33.0 mmHg [35-45], pH 7.350 [7.350-7.450], bicarbonate (HCO3) 18.2 mmol/l [21-26], lactate 18.0 mg/dl [4.5-19.8 ]. Biochemistry: glucose 181 mg/dl [70-110], urea 59 mg/dl [10-50], creatinine 1.53 mg/dl [.40-1.20], albumin 4.38 g/dl [3.50-5.50], total bilirubin 1.47 mg/dl [0-1.2], GPT 154 U/L [5-41], CK 214 U/L [0-195], troponin T 142 ng/l [0-14], total calcium 9.78 mg/dl [8.40-10.40], sodium 141.0 mmol/l [135-145], potassium 3.94 mmol/l [3.50-5.10], C-reactive protein 0.33 mg/dl [0-.50], HbA1c 5.9%. HRF: haemoglobin 16.6 g/dl [14.1-18], platelets 260 10^3/μL [135-450 ], leucocytes * 13.0 10^3/μL [4.5-11 ] (neutrophils 73.8 %, lymphocytes 18.5 %). Coagulation: prothrombin index 95 % [65-120], INR 1.03, APTT 33.6 sg [25-40], functional fibrinogen 324 mg/dL [200-450]. Enzyme curve: CK 182 U/L, troponin T 157 ng/L. Other analytical determinations: lipidogram: total cholesterol 206 mg/dL, HDL 61 mg/dL, triglycerides 203 mg/dL. Iron metabolism: iron 93 μg/dl [59-158], ferritin 223 ng/ml [30-400]. Immunological study: ANAs, PR3-ANCA, MPO-ANCA antibodies negative. Normal thyroid hormones: TSH 1.29 μU/ml [0.27-4.20], free T4 14.8 pmol/l [10.3-26.0]. Enzymes: ACE 31 U/L [10-50]. Negative serologies for CMV, enterovirus, parvovirus, HCV, HIV, Trypanosoma cruzi. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle not dilated, slightly hypertrophic and with good overall systolic function but at the limit of normality (LVEF 54%). Doubtful hypokinesia in the lower basal segment. No valvulopathies. Right chambers not dilated and with good function. Mild PHT. Coronary angio-CT: coronary network without significant lesions CMR: LV slightly dilated with mildly depressed global function. Hypokinesia of the basal medial inferior aspect. EF: 50%. In the Stir potentiated sequences an area of oedema was visualised in basal septal segments. In the early enhancement sequences, enhancement was visualised in the segments in which late enhancement was identified. In the late enhancement sequences: intramyocardial enhancement with transmural areas in basal septal segments, subepicardial enhancement in medial lower basal segments and extending with subendocardial enhancement to the inferolateral basal segment. Electrophysiological study: sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Substrate ablation with RDF. ICD implantation is indicated. The patient arrived at the study in sinus rhythm at 55 bpm with first-degree AVB and narrow QRS. The procedure was performed under sedation with propofol and ultiva and with the Navex-precision system. The left ventricle was mapped with the ablation catheter obtaining an anatomy and voltage map showing a single area of low voltage in the lateral area of the mitral annulus, where pacemapping reproduced the morphology of the tachycardia. Induction of clinical VT is attempted but not achieved at baseline. After iv. isoproterenol, clinical VT is induced and RDF is applied to the lateral aspect of the mitral annulus where early potential and good prior pacemapping is obtained. During application, VT changes morphology and accelerates to a ventricular flutter that requires an electric shock for its termination. It is decided to continue with substrate ablation by administering a corona of lesions around the previous area in the mitral annulus.  EVOLUTION In the case of the patient in question, given that he had remained stable at all times, showed no signs of heart failure and remained asymptomatic, it was decided to admit him to the ward with telemetry and treatment was started with beta-blockers (bisoprolol 2.5 mg, 1-0-1). Given that most VTs occur in the context of ischaemic heart disease, it seems reasonable that this was the first possibility to rule out, despite the fact that neither the clinical, analytical nor echocardiographic data corresponded to ischaemic heart disease. As this was a patient with few CVRFs, it was decided to perform a coronary angio-CT scan. This showed a coronary network with no significant lesions. Therefore, this cause was ruled out as a possible diagnosis. To complete the study, a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was scheduled. The findings could be related to myocarditis as a first possibility due to its frequency, but these enhancements are described in other less probable entities, such as sarcoidosis or Chagas disease. The possibility of sarcoidosis was considered, since the patient had a long RP and AVBs are quite frequent in this entity. This possibility was also ruled out since, although there are few cases of cardiac sarcoidosis without systemic involvement, there were no mediastinal adenopathies, restrictive signs or myocardial thickening to further support this diagnosis. Acute myocarditis was therefore the first possibility. During admission, the patient remained in sinus rhythm at all times with HR around 60-75 bpm, with increasingly infrequent VT, but even after a week in hospital, there were still bouts of non-sustained monomorphic VT, self-limited almost daily, with a maximum duration of about 20 seconds, with haemodynamic repercussions in some cases, for which reason amiodarone was associated without reducing the number of daily events. In view of this situation, it was decided to ablate the VT substrate. In the electrophysiological study, during radiofrequency application, the VT changes morphology and accelerates to a ventricular flutter that requires an electric shock for its termination. It is decided to continue with substrate ablation by administering a lesion corona around the previous area in the mitral annulus. The reproducibility of post-ablation VT was not tested for fear of replaying the ventricular flutter and implantation of a bicameral ICD was indicated. A couple of days later the ICD was implanted without complications and the patient was discharged. The patient is currently asymptomatic and is being treated with beta-blockers (bisoprolol 5 mg, 1-0-1). Periodic follow-up is carried out in electrophysiology consultations and control of the device by remote monitoring. So far, 5 months after the episode presented, no arrhythmia requiring ICD discharge has been recorded, with only a few asymptomatic and self-limited episodes of NSTEVM.  DIAGNOSIS Sustained ventricular tachycardia in the context of probable acute myocarditis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The case in question focuses on a 72-year-old male admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for arrhythmic storm in November 2016. The personal history of this patient is: Independent for basic activities of daily living (ABVD). Smoker. Arterial hypertension (AHT), dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus on treatment with oral antidiabetics (OAD). Stage 3A chronic kidney disease (CKD). Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Bladder neoplasia in 2011 treated with surgery (cystoprostatectomy + Bricker ureteroileostomy) and later QT. Cardiological history: chronic ischaemic heart disease (acute myocardial infarction [AMI] in 1999) stable, with follow-up by his primary care physician. As previously mentioned, the patient was admitted in an arrhythmic storm. To stop the arrhythmic problem in the acute phase, the patient required five cardioversions and continuous venous perfusion of procainamide. Due to persistent non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) of similar morphology to that described above, the patient was overstimulated by femoral electrocatheter, and the arrhythmogenic activity was resolved. During his admission, coronary angiography was performed which showed diffuse ischaemic heart disease, with 3-vessel disease, without acute lesions and cardiac surgery was ruled out, given the patient's high surgical risk. The patient was referred for electrophysiological study (EPS) and ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) which, as a complication, presented complete atrioventricular (AV) block that persisted after 1 week of EPS, it was therefore finally decided to implant a bicameral implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) (because he had ischaemic heart disease without acute lesions that could explain the arrhythmic storm, with severe ventricular dysfunction - EF4C Simpson 30% - and a prognosis of more than 12 months) and he was discharged with the following treatment: adiro 100 mg (1 tablet daily), bisoprolol 5 mg (1 tablet in the morning), atorvastatin 40 mg (1 tablet in the evening), amiodarone 200 mg (every 24 hours at lunch), inhaled indacaterol/glycopyrronium (every 24 hours), budesonide 200 mcg (every 12 hours), hydroferol ampoule (drinkable every 10 days). The patient remained asymptomatic for angina and ventricular arrhythmias for 8 months, until July 2017 when he was admitted to internal medicine for febrile syndrome under study.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS on admission (23 July 2017): creatinine 1.95 mg/dl (33.9 ml/mi/1.73 m2), urea 52 mg/dl, sodium 137 mEq/l, potassium 4.3 mEq/l, CRP 37.2 mg/dl, INR 1.02, Hb 10.7 g/dl, Hto 31.2%, leukocytes 21900 (PMN 92%), platelets 207000. HEMOCULTURES: 23/07: positive for Staphylococcus aureus oxacillin sensitive. 06/08: negative. 09/08: negative. 11/08: Staphylococcus epidermidis grows in a bottle (considered contamination). 14/08: negative. 16/08: negative. 21/08: negative. 24/08: negative. 28/08: negative.  THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: slightly rotated plaque with cardiothoracic index (CTI) at the limit of normality, slight signs of vascular redistribution. Right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) electrodes in normal position, with no signs of fracture. PET-CT scan: Focal uptake in the path of the LAD lead at the level of the left subclavian artery suspected to correspond to the infectious process causing the bacteraemia and fever, with another smaller and milder uptake observed in the posterosuperior face of the LAD at the exit of the lead, probably related to the same aetiology. Discrete bilateral pleural effusion. Post radical cystoprostatectomy changes with Bricker shunt. No other hypermetabolic locations in the rest of the study. TEE: non-dilated left ventricle (LV), with severe depression of myocardial function and akinesia of all anterior and lateral segments. RV with LAD lead, in which at the level of the tricuspid valve there is a sessile, beating image, compatible with vegetation dependent on the device lead, measuring 3 x 5 mm.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient remained asymptomatic for 8 months until July 2017, when he was admitted to internal medicine for febrile syndrome under study. Blood cultures (2 x 2 serial cultures) showed Staphylococcus aureus. A transesophageal echocardiogram was requested, which showed vegetation on the device. A PET-CT scan was requested, which showed infection of the ICD lead. Initially, daptomycin had been prescribed, which was changed to cloxacillin with the antibiogram results. After confirming infection of the ICD catheter, daptomycin adjusted to glomerular filtration rate and rifampicin were reintroduced. Gentamicin was not added due to deterioration of renal function. He was transferred to cardiac surgery at the reference centre for explant of the device, and extraction with energy sources was performed. Subsequently, she was readmitted to the OCU, remaining with an escape rate of 36-38 bpm with good tolerance. Antibiotic therapy with cloxacillin was maintained during admission. The patient had episodes of NSVT and, despite the bradycardia, amiodarone was reintroduced. The patient tolerated sitting and ambulation with no signs of low cardiac output. After negative culture serology and a control echocardiogram with no evidence of vegetation, it was decided to implant a new device. The possibility of an epicardial approach was discussed, but finally, transvenous ICD-DDD implantation was performed. After discharge, the patient was monitored by the infectious disease service of our centre and has remained clinically stable to date.  DIAGNOSIS Endocarditis due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus on native tricuspid valve associated with device. Complete AV block post-ablation. History of arrhythmic storm that led to ICD implantation. Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Mild ventricular dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Severe COPD. Stage 3A chronic kidney disease. Functional monorenal. Cystoprostatectomy and Bricker ureteroileostomy for bladder neoplasia in 2011 and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Arterial hypertension. Diabetes mellitus.

HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 38-year-old man with no CVRF, family history or previous cardiological history. Under digestive follow-up for Crohn's disease with enterovesical fistula and recent admission for severe infectious disease of abdominal origin. Clinical judgement at discharge was septic shock secondary to perforation of toxic megacolon with faecaloid peritonitis, requiring urgent surgical intervention (subtotal colectomy + ileostomy). Three days after discharge from the general surgery department, he consulted for chest pain. This discomfort was atypical and partially improved with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). He also reported progressive dyspnoea that started at the same time and became minimal effort (New York Heart Association functional class III [NYHA III]. There were no other cardiological symptoms in the anamnesis. On examination, the patient's general condition was acceptable. He is eupneic at rest and tolerates decubitus. Blood pressure (BP) 90/70 mmHg. Tachycardic at 110 bpm. Afebrile. No jugular ingurgitation. Tracheostomy (previous prolonged stay in the intensive care unit [ICU]) without complication data. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was unremarkable. Abdomen soft and depressible, with normofunctioning ileostomy. There was a soft tissue lesion in the left fossa with mucopurulent secretion. Lower limbs without oedema. The electrocardiogram performed in the consultation room showed sinus tachycardia with generalised flattening of the T wave. The chest X-ray was unremarkable. Blood tests showed haemoglobin (Hb) of 8.6 g/dl and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) without leukocytosis. D-dimer negative. Serial ultrasensitive troponin T (TnTus) maintained at around 30 (25-30-29 ng/l), normal CPK. Urgent echocardiography was performed, showing severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 30%) with global hypokinesia, and the patient was admitted to cardiology.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS: renal function preserved. No leukocytosis or neutrophilia. Hb 8.6 g/dl. Platelets and coagulation in range. D-dimer negative. TNT US 25---30---29. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: normal cardiothoracic index. Free costophrenic sinuses. Slight increase of interstitial tissue at the bases. No images of condensation or pleural effusion. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus tachycardia at 100 bpm. Normal PR. Narrow QRS. Generalised flattening of the T wave. Normal QTc. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): left atrium of normal dimensions (24 mm in AP). Mitral valve with fine leaflets and good mobility (opening and closing preserved). Left ventricle (LV) of normal dimensions (end-diastolic diameter (EDD) 49 mm and end-systolic diameter (ESD) 43 mm with end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) of 136 ml and 97 ml, respectively). Normal myocardial thickness (8 mm septum and 7 mm inferolateral wall). Generalised hypocontractility and ejection fraction (EF) estimated by biplane disc of 29%.

No significant valvulopathies. No pericardial effusion. Conclusion: signs of severe contractile dysfunction of the LV without deriving from this exploration data to guide possible aetiology. The examination was not complete as it was interrupted at the patient's express wish (incomplete sequence/no late gadolinium enhancement). Control abdominal CT scan: resolution of the previous effusions. 14 mm lesion in segment VI of the liver (haemangioma). Discrete splenomegaly 12.2 x 5.6 cm. Collections in the anterior abdominal wall: one under the laparotomy scar (30 x 7 x 10 mm) and another more caudalsupravesical (12 x 13 x 38 mm). At retroperitoneal level in right anterior pararenal space (56 x 20 x 52 mm) and right posterior pararenal space (60 x 29 x 137 mm) and left anterior pararenal space (38 x 17 x 47 mm). Uncomplicated right vacuum ileostomy. Loops of normal calibre with no mucosal hypercaptation or mural thickening suggestive of current inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). No other striking alterations.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION A regular TTE was requested which showed severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF by Simpson biplane of 29%) with global hypocontractility (see complete report in complementary tests). Ischaemic aetiology of the systolic dysfunction was ruled out by coronary angiography. To complete the study, CMR was performed, which showed no data suggesting an aetiology (normal T2 and STIR, without being able to administer late enhancement due to the patient's refusal) (see full report in complementary tests). After reviewing the literature and, taking into account the clinical context of the patient, two diagnostic possibilities are evaluated, which are not mutually exclusive: Severe ventricular dysfunction in the context of gram-negative sepsis (recent faecaloid peritonitis). Deficiency cardiomyopathy in a patient with probable nutritional deficit (Crohn's disease with prolonged admission to the ICU). The patient started treatment for systolic dysfunction during admission: carvedilol 6.25 mg (2-0-1), ramipril 2.5 mg (1⁄2 tablet at breakfast), oral ferrotherapy (1 tablet on an empty stomach) and loop diuretics in initial phases. Treatment with spironolactone was not started due to low blood pressure with a minimum dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor). The possibility of vitamin (vitamin D-thiamine) and trace element (selenium-iron) deficiency was assessed. Samples were taken for intraerythrocyte trancetolase activity and selenium, iron profile, vitamin D and folic acid. Treatment was started with IV thiamine, polyvitamin complex, polymeric supplements and an optimised oral diet. The patient's follow-up during admission was multidisciplinary: Digestive/general surgery: treatment with azathioprine was restarted. A control CAT scan was performed (see complementary tests) and, in view of the patient's good evolution, it was decided to continue with antibibiotherapy (metronidazole), clinical follow-up and re-evaluation by imaging test in two months' time. Nutrition: supervises treatment during admission, achieving a weight gain of 3 kg. Otorhinolaryngology: assesses the tracheostomy and proceeds to decannulation. The tracheostomy was closed by second intention. The patient's evolution was favourable, being discharged without chest pain and in good functional class. Treatment at discharge was as follows: omeprazole 20 mg (1-0-0). carvedilol 6.25 mg (2-0-1), ramipril 2.5 mg (0.5-0-0), metronidazole 250 mg every 8 hours, oral iron (1-0-0), vitamin complex (2 tablets per day), cinitapride (1 mg every 8 hours), thiamine (300 mg every 24 hours), Ca + VitD 1000 U complex (2 tablets per day), calorie shakes, citalopram 20 mg (1 tablet per day), lorazepam 1 mg (at night), fibre-free diet avoiding excess fibre. At the consultation two months after admission, the patient was asymptomatic and there was no recurrence of chest pain. TTE showed normalisation of LVEF. The patient has regained weight and has had no new Crohn's flares/abdominal complications. The tracheostomy has closed by second intention. Discharge was decided by the advanced HF and transplant team for periodic follow-up in the local cardiology department.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure in a patient with transient severe left ventricular dysfunction in the context of Gram-negative sepsis. Possibly aggravated by nutritional deficits secondary to his digestive pathology (Crohn's disease) and recent prolonged hospitalisation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CURRENT ILLNESS: A 62-year-old male patient with the above-described history was referred to the emergency department for evaluation due to elevated markers of myocardial damage. The patient consulted for clinical symptoms of dizziness, general malaise and instability in the previous 24 hours. In addition, he reported atypical chest pain throughout the day, coinciding with the rest of the clinical picture, which he differentiated from his previous angina. He was accompanied by his wife, who was suffering symptoms of headache and dizziness similar to those of our patient.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Conscious, oriented, cooperative.

ARTERIAL GASOMETRY: pH (arterial gas) 7.41, pCO2 (arterial gas) 31 mmHg low, pO2 (arterial gas) 71 mmHg low. Bicarbonate (arterial gas) 21.4 mmol/l. Total CO2 (arterial gas) 21 mmol/l. Excess bases (arterial gas) -4.5 mmol/l low. Oxyhaemoglobin saturation (arterial gas) 93% low. Carboxyhaemoglobin on admission 14%. Carboxyhaemoglobin after hyperbaric chamber normal. MARKERS OF MYOCARDIAL DAMAGE: CK (U/L) 1985->2508 (at 24 hours)->441 (at 48 hours). TnT (ng/l, normal to 35) 1836->3828 (at 24 hours)->6000 (at 48 hours). ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 75 bpm. Signs of left atrial enlargement and left bundle branch block (LBBB). THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: normal cardiothoracic index. No condensation or signs of heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (urgent): left ventricle slightly dilated with severe systolic dysfunction at the expense of akinesia of the middle and apical segment of the septum and global hypokinesia of the rest of the segments, more marked in the inferolateral and inferior wall. Right ventricle of normal size and systolic function. Left atrium of normal size. Aortic valve with good opening, slightly calcified. Trivial mitral insufficiency. No indirect signs of pulmonary hypertension. Inferior vena cava not dilated. No pericardial effusion. CORONARYGRAPHY: coronary arteries with irregularities, without significant lesions. Good appearance of the stent implanted in the right coronary artery (CD), which shows no significant restenosis.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Carbon monoxide poisoning was suspected (wood cooker at home) and carboxyhaemoglobin was requested, which turned out to be 14%, confirming the diagnosis. Hyperbaric chamber treatment was indicated with a session at 2.3 ATA, which left the patient asymptomatic and normalised carboxyhaemoglobin levels after 24 hours.  Given the marked elevation of biomarkers, cardiological assessment was requested after the hyperbaric chamber session. At that time the patient was asymptomatic in the anamnesis by systems, although the ECG showed complete left bundle branch block (LBBB), which we did not know if it was already known. An urgent echocardiogram was performed and showed a dilated left ventricle with impaired contractility and severe systolic dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) secondary to carbon monoxide poisoning and was admitted to the coronary unit, under routine treatment and management. Twenty-four hours after admission, coronary angiography was performed, showing coronary arteries without significant lesions with good results of the stent previously implanted in the right coronary artery. Subsequently, we were able to contact the patient's cardiologist, who informed us of the existence of LBBB and contractility alterations.  DIAGNOSIS Carbon monoxide poisoning treated by hyperbaric chamber. High-risk NSTEACS in the context of the above. Dilated left ventricle with severely depressed LVEF. LBBB. Ischaemic heart disease with 1-vessel disease (DC) with drug-eluting stent implantation in DC, with no evidence of thrombosis or restenosis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Male, 61 years old.  BACKGROUND: Arterial hypertension. Dyslipidaemia. Dilated cardiomyopathy of ischaemic origin with moderate ventricular dysfunction, non-revascularised chronic ischaemic heart disease. Permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) anticoagulated with acenocoumarol. Rheumatic mitral valve disease with mechanical prosthesis implantation in 1977 and subsequent replacement in 2001. Medical treatment: telmisartan 40 mg/day, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/day, eplerenone 25 mg/day, digoxin 0.25 mg/day, acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day, omeprazole 20 mg/day, atorvastatin 40 mg/day, ranolazine 375 mg/12 hours, acenocoumarol according to controls.  CURRENT DISEASE: She attended the emergency department of our hospital in February 2015 due to an increase in her usual dyspnoea from moderate to minimal exertion, in the last week. She denied cough, fever or other concomitant symptoms. She was admitted to cardiology with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary oedema.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 140/60 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 110 bpm. Jugular venous pulse (PVY): normal. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic tones with mitral opening click and pansystolic murmur in mitral focus. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur (VCM) with crackles up to the middle third of both lung fields. Lower extremities: no oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS: Cr 1.23 mg/dl. CK 3 U/L. Total bilirubin 1.37 mg/dl. Direct bilirubin 0.36 mg/dl. Indirect bilirubin 1.01 mg/dl. LDH 1.086 U/L. Sodium 137 mmol/l. Potassium 4.4 mmol/l. CRP 3.7 mg/l. Haptoglobin 3 mg/dl. Hb 9.4 g/dl. Hcto 28.2%. MCV 84.1 fl. Leukocytes 7,670 u/l. Platelets 163.000 u/l. APTT 50.6 s. T. protombin 35.2%. INR 3.3. Fibrinogen 598 mg/dl. Admission electrocardiogram (ECG): AF with ventricular response at 140 bpm, LBBB with secondary repolarisation alterations. Transthoracic echocardiography (February 2015): dilated left atrium and left ventricle with mild-moderate ventricular hypertrophy with mild inferior hypokinesia, preserved remaining segmental contractility and slightly depressed systolic function (LVEF 47%). Mitral mechanical prosthesis with mild-moderate obstruction (mean gradient 5-6 mmHg, AVM per THP 1.4-1.45 cm2). Trivalve aortic valve, slightly thickened with mild regurgitation. Ascending aorta slightly dilated. Structurally and functionally normal pulmonary valve. Structurally normal tricuspid valve with trivial regurgitation. Very dilated inferior vena cava. Absence of pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiography (June 2015): paraseptal periprosthetic dehiscence in A3-P3 of 6 mm in diameter causing moderate-severe mitral regurgitation with jet directed towards the interatrial septum, reaching the roof of the left atrium. CARDIAC CATHETERISM (February 2015): right dominance. Left common trunk without lesions. Lesion of 90% in the middle anterior descending artery. Lesion of 90% in bisector. Long lesion in middle circumflex artery. 90% lesions in proximal, middle and distal right coronary artery. After this, the third cardiac surgery is performed, with closure of the leak and coronary revascularisation. Transesophageal echocardiography (June 2015 - after surgical repair): periprosthetic paravalvular dehiscence of 6 mm in diameter, which caused moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with a jet directed towards the interatrial septum reaching the roof of the atrium. CARDIAC CATHETERISM (September 2015): percutaneous closure of periprosthetic leak with retrograde transfemoral arterial approach. Transesophageal echocardiography (September 2015 - in the periprocedural haemodynamics room): the device is correctly implanted with new appearance of another periprosthetic leak. 3D Transesophageal Cardiac Echocardiography (September 2015 - in the periprocedural cath lab): the device is correctly implanted with the appearance of another periprosthetic leak.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During admission, transesophageal echocardiography revealed a mitral periprosthetic leak at A3-P3, leading to severe mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography showed 3-vessel disease, so after clinical stabilisation with diuretics, he was accepted for surgery, with triple bypass and closure of the leak with four stitches, with a good result on postoperative echocardiography. During the following months, the patient presented several admissions for decompensated heart failure (HF) and haemolytic anaemia that required several periodic transfusions. Transesophageal echocardiography showed the presence of a new periprosthetic paravalvular dehiscence of 6 mm in diameter, causing moderate-severe mitral regurgitation with a jet directed towards the interatrial septum reaching the roof of the atrium. Given the high surgical risk due to previous cardiac surgery and associated comorbidities, percutaneous closure of the periprosthetic leak with retrograde transfemoral arterial approach was chosen. During implantation of the Amplatzer device, a new paravalvular leak appeared showing mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with a central jet, making it impossible to approach during this procedure (videos 5 and 6). It was therefore decided to discharge the patient and monitor his progress. In the following months and progressively, he presented poor ambulatory functional class, requiring several admissions for decompensated HF secondary to the appearance of this last periprosthetic dehiscence close to the severe Amplatzer device (21 x 37 mm). Thus, we are dealing with a young patient with recurrent paravalvular dehiscences, who presents a high surgical risk and requires a safe intervention with a high success rate. Accordingly, despite the need for a thoracostomy and apical puncture, the transapical approach was the best option for the patient. A rectangular Occlutech PDL device was implanted in the appropriate position under transesophageal echocardiography guidance. Control transesophageal echocardiography showed that the paravalvular leak was sealed with minimal residual regurgitation. The patient was discharged 4 days after the procedure and the post-procedure course was uneventful during the 2-year follow-up.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 77-year-old woman, with no cardiovascular risk factors. Personal history of bronchial asthma with occasional bronchodilator treatment and two episodes of superficial venous thrombosis. Cardiological history: she consulted the cardiology department for episodes of central thoracic pressure on exertion accompanied by dizziness, sweating and trembling of the limbs. They occurred almost daily, so she has limited her physical activity.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable systolic murmur in aortic focus without erasing second noise. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 110 bpm without acute repolarisation alterations. Echocardioscopy showed a hypertrophic left ventricle (LV), non-dilated, with preserved ejection fraction [LVEF], without alterations in segmental motility or significant valvular heart disease, or pericardial effusion. On suspicion of ischaemic heart disease, treatment was started with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), beta-blockers and statins, and an outpatient study with exercise echocardiogram was requested. The exercise echocardiogram showed moderate baseline left ventricular hypertrophy with mitral systolic anterior systolic motion, baseline dynamic gradient of 40 mmHg and akinesia of all apical segments. During exercise the akinesia extended to mid segments of all sides with moderate dysfunction and increased dynamic gradient to 95 mmHg. Preferential catheterisation and routine laboratory tests were requested. A few days later, the patient visited her primary care physician for worsening functional class with dyspnoea and mild exertional chest pain. Physical examination revealed crackles in the right base and oedema in the ankles. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with negative T waves, symmetrical and deep V3-V6 and negative T waves in the inferior face. In addition, the analysis requested by the cardiologist showed suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with free T4 63.7 (normal reference values 10.6-26). She was referred to the emergency department of our hospital. On arrival she was haemodynamically stable with blood pressure (BP) 105/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR) 85 bpm. Afebrile. Oxygen saturation (SatO2) 94%. Well perfused and slightly tachypneic (25 rpm) at rest. Physical examination revealed jugular ingurgitation at the base of the neck, systolic murmur in the aortic focus, crackles in the lung bases and discrete oedema in the lower limbs. While in the emergency department he presented with an episode of precordial pain at rest, with no dynamic changes in the ECG. Suspicion of unstable angina led to admission to the coronary unit.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS STRESS ECOCARDIOGRAM (outpatient): Baseline echocardiogram: moderate left ventricular hypertrophy. Akinesia of the apical half of the inferior, anterior and posterior septum and of the apical segment of the anterior face and anterior septum. Systolic function preserved but at the lower limit of normal. Left atrium slightly dilated (20-30 cm2). Slightly thickened mitral valve, with SAM leading to mild mitral regurgitation (MR). The right ventricle (RV) is normal in terms of size and systolic function. Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation with Vd-Ad gradient of 48 mmHg. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PSAP) of 55 mmHg. Trivalve aortic valve, normofunctioning. In the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) there is turbulent flow with a dynamic gradient of 40 mmHg. The aortic root is of normal size. Stress echocardiogram: he performed 55 seconds of the first step, presenting intense dyspnoea that forced the test to be suspended. He reached 100% of the maximum theoretical heart rate (MTHRF). During exercise, akinesia extends to the middle segments of all faces with moderate dysfunction and an increase in the dynamic gradient to 95 mmHg. ECG on admission: sinus rhythm at 86 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS with axis at 60o, negative T waves in V3-V6 and inferior face, QTc 433 ms. ANALYTICS: biochemistry: glucose 106 mg/dl, urea 42 mg/dl, creatinine 0.40 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, total cholesterol 114 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 59 mg/dl, non-HDL cholesterol 55 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 37 mg/dl, triglycerides 91 mg/dl, albumin 3.64 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.74 mg/dl, GOT 33 U/l, GPT 39 U/l, GGT 74 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 64 U/l, phosphorus 2.55 mg/dl, total calcium 9.32 mg/dl, sodium 143 mmol/l, potassium 4.46 mmol/l, iron 103 μg/dl, C-reactive protein 0.1 mg/dl, ferritin 106 ng/ml, HbA1c 5.8%. TSH < 0.005 μU/ml, free T4 63.7 pmol/l. Myocardial damage marker curve: TnT 17 ng/l [normal 0-14] --> 20 --> 14, CK 34 U/l --> 33 --> 39. Haemogram: haemoglobin 13.1 g/dl, platelets 279 10^3/μl, leucocytes 5.7 10^3/μl, neutrophils 43.4%, lymphocytes 33.3%, monocytes 14.9%, eosinophils 7.5%, basophils 0.9%. CHEST X-RAY: no cardiomegaly, slight vascular redistribution to upper fields, free costophrenic sinuses. ECHOCARDIOGRAM on admission: non-dilated LV with moderate concentric hypertrophy. Preserved global systolic function (LVEF 64%) with no abnormalities of segmental contractility. Tricuspid aortic valve with preserved opening, without significant functional alterations. Dynamic gradient in LVOT, maximum of 28 mmHg. SAM is observed with mild protosystolic MR. Slightly dilated left atrium. RV not dilated with preserved systolic function. Mild tricuspid insufficiency, with Vd-Ad gradient 22 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. CARDIAC CATHETERISM: coronary network without lesions. AL ALTA ECOCARDIOGRAM: small LV with mild concentric parietal hypertrophy and moderate septal hypertrophy. Global systolic function preserved, compared with previous outpatient study, having disappeared the alterations of apical motility and basal hyperdynamics that caused systolic gradient. Diastolic pattern of elongated relaxation. RV is normal with respect to size and function. Slightly dilated left atrium (20-30 cm2). Mild calcification of the posterior mitral annulus with mild MR. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI) with Vd-Ad gradient 31 mmHg. Estimated PSAP 36 mmHg. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Sclerosed aortic valve, trivalve, without functional alterations. The aortic root is of normal size. No pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the coronary unit with a suspected diagnosis of unstable angina. During her stay she remained haemodynamically stable with a slight tendency to arterial hypotension. In the echocardiogram on admission, no alterations in segmental contractility were observed, with a dynamic gradient persisting in the LVOT but of a lesser magnitude than in the outpatient echocardiogram. In the first 24 hours of admission, the patient presented several episodes of central thoracic pressure accompanied by intense sweating, nausea and tremor of the extremities. Given the presence of a dynamic gradient in LVOT and the analytical results compatible with thyrotoxicosis, beta-blocker treatment with atenolol was intensified for adequate symptomatic control and the congestive symptoms were resolved with intravenous diuretic treatment. She was assessed by the endocrinology department where, given the abruptness of the hyperthyroid symptoms, eosinophilia and relative lymphomonocytosis, they suspected Graves-Basedow disease as the first possibility and indicated treatment with methimazole 15 mg/12 hours. Coronary angiography was performed, revealing a coronary arterial network without lesions. Given these results, the improvement of the segmental alterations in the echocardiography, the recovery of left ventricular systolic function and the good symptomatic control with the prescribed treatment, the condition was interpreted as tako-tsubo syndrome in the context of the debut of primary hyperthyroidism. The process was continued in outpatient endocrinology and cardiology consultations. She remained euthyroid and asymptomatic, without dyspnoea or exertional angina, palpitations or other cardiovascular symptoms, and was discharged after 3 months of follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Tako-tsubo syndrome secondary to primary hyperthyroidism, suspected Graves-Basedow disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION 74-year-old female patient, with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, admitted for chronic HF with no clear trigger. Given the signs of poor peripheral perfusion and haemodynamic deterioration, it was decided to administer a pulse of levosimendan as positive inotropic support to achieve early recovery from acute HF. This was carried out with good haemodynamic tolerance and good clinical response, achieving stabilisation with diuretic support 72 hours after admission following decompensation. Likewise, the resynchronisation therapy of the ICD-CRT device was optimised, presenting a QRS of 150 ms on admission, and after optimisation and adjustment of the interventricular delay, a reduction to 132 ms was achieved. After compensation of the acute HF condition and prior to discharge, medication for the treatment of chronic HF was optimised in order to plan a transition after the decompensation and subsequent follow-up in outpatient clinics, for which the previous home treatment was reinstated and an analysis of the iron deposits was carried out. The patient was discharged from hospital and followed up in the HF outpatient clinic, where the continuation of medication titration, correction of the functional iron deficiency and inclusion in a treatment programme with repeated doses of levosimendan on an outpatient basis were considered.  DIAGNOSIS Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Severe functional mitral regurgitation. Chronic heart failure stage C. NYHA functional class III. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  We present the case of a woman with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), intracavitary thrombus and absolute contraindication for long-term anticoagulant treatment due to associated comorbidities.  BACKGROUND: No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): Hypertension and dyslipidaemia. No known diabetes. Diagnosed with hypertensive heart disease with mild ischaemia in latero-apical segments and admitted in July 2014 for transient ST elevation without evidence of significant coronary lesions on coronary angiography. Paroxysmal AF of uncertain chronology diagnosed in February 2014, anticoagulated with synthrom. Small vessel cerebrovascular disease being monitored by neurology. Doppler of TSA normal. Hiatal hernia. Haemorrhoidal syndrome. Previous surgical interventions: appendectomy. Usual treatment: Synthrom according to established guidelines based on periodic INR controls, diltiazem 120 mg every 12 hours, carvedilol 25 mg every 12 hours. Torasemide 5mg every 24 hours, atorvastatin 40 mg every 24 hours. Omeprazole 20 mg every 24 hours. Lorazepam 1 mg in the evening.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Admitted to cardiology for worsening functional class of months of evolution with clear onset of dyspnoea on moderate exertion, occasional episodes of palpitations and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea in the days prior to ED consultation. On admission, he presented fever of up to 38oC maintained for 3 days without an objectifiable focus, and a microbiological examination was performed, which was negative. The condition progressed to a deterioration in the level of consciousness and a cranial CT scan was requested, showing a right frontal intraparenchymal haematoma that did not move the midline or open to the ventricles, and did not require surgical drainage. For this reason, anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (started on admission instead of synthroid) was suspended and neurology was contacted to assess the case. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull was performed and a diagnosis of probable amyloid angiopathy was made. Once the haemorrhagic focus was stabilised and given the high embolic risk (CHA2DS2 VASc 4) and high haemorrhagic risk (HAS-BLED 3 points), the patient was proposed as a candidate for programmed left atrial appendage closure (class IIb-B indication according to the ESC 2016 guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of AF), and was referred for discharge with mono-antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg every 24 hours).  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Good general condition. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Afebrile on admission. Haemodynamically stable with blood pressure (BP) 110/70 mmHg and heart rate (HR) 85 bpm. Eupneic at rest and speech with head at 30o. No jugular ingurgitation or hepatojugular reflux. On auscultation, arrhythmic cardiac tones without audible murmurs. Vesicular murmur preserved with bibasal crackles. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of DVT. No other noteworthy findings on examination.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): AF at 130 bpm. Wide QRS with morphology of complete left bundle branch block (LBBB), previously known. ANALYSIS: no mobilisation of cardiac biomarkers (ultrasensitive troponin T [TnTus] peak 16 ng/l). Other findings were unremarkable. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: cardiomegaly, no other pathological findings. Absence of pulmonary congestion. TRANSTORACIC ECOCARDIOGRAPHY: LA diameter AP 31mm. Apical area 24 cm2 and volume 79 ml. Dilated left ventricle (LV) (LVEDV 57 mm), globular morphology. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) severely depressed, by Simpson LVEF 17%, with global hypokinesia. Monophasic E filling pattern. Mitral valve with tenting closure resulting in mild functional mitral regurgitation (MR). Aortic valve with preserved opening and function. Non-dilated right ventricle (RV) (RVDVD 22.6 mm) with TAPSE 14 mm. Tricuspid insufficiency (TI) grade II with peak RV-RA gradient 29 mmHg, which allows estimating a systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs) 35-40 mmHg. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with normal inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. UROCULTURE and HEMOCULTURE: negative. Cranial CT scan: right frontal intraparenchymal haematoma that did not displace the midline or open into the ventricles. Cranial MRI: right frontal lobar haemorrhage and small vessel vasculopathy, findings compatible with probable amyloid angiopathy. ANGIO-CT chest: drainage of left pulmonary veins into normal left atrium, through two independent ostia. The left atrial appendage has a digitiform morphology and an implantation base with a wide neck, approximately 2 x 2 cm. Adherent thrombotic material, probably of chronic evolution, can be seen in its cul-de-sac. Dilated LV (transverse diameter of about 55 mm). Right atrium (RA) 55 mm. Left atrium (LA) 47 mm. Transesophageal echocardiography: left atrial appendage with an entrance of 17 x 19 mm, depth of 30 mm, thrombus is seen inside the left atrial appendage.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After discharge, the patient was scheduled for a chest CT angiography and transesophageal echocardiography prior to atrial appendage closure. Both tests showed the existence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage, a situation that contraindicated its closure. Therefore, the case was assessed in a medical session (heart team) and it was decided to start anticoagulation with dabigatran 110 mg every 12 hours for 3 months, for resolution of the thrombus and subsequent echocardiographic control. During these 3 months of treatment with dabigatran, she evolved without incident, being asymptomatic and without haemorrhagic complications. After echocardiographic control confirmed the resolution of the thrombus (video 3), the left atrial appendage was closed with the Amplatzer Amulet device, without complications during the procedure and with a good final result. Subsequently, anticoagulation was maintained with dabigatran 110 mg every 12 hours for a further 45 days, with no associated haemorrhagic complications, and after its withdrawal the patient was kept on mono-antiplatelet therapy indefinitely with ASA 100 mg every 24 hours. Subsequent echocardiographic controls showed the Amulet device to be correctly placed and the left atrial appendage to be free of thrombus. Likewise, due to the patient's baseline cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention. Currently, she maintains a good functional class and is asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view.  DIAGNOSIS Dilated cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 17%). Permanent AF (CHA2DS2-VASc 4 points, HAS-BLED 3 points). Probable amyloid angiopathy leading to right lobar lobar intraparenchymal haematoma. Thrombus in left atrial appendage. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 75-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, ischaemic stroke, chronic ischaemic heart disease and aortic biological prosthesis due to severe aortic stenosis 2 years ago, requiring DDD pacemaker implantation due to advanced post-surgical atrioventricular block. She was admitted with fever and a slight increase in her usual dyspnoea in the last 2 weeks, with orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. On medical history, he denied any associated respiratory infectious symptoms.  Physical examination: BP 145/62 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, SatO2 98% on room air, Ta 38.2°C. Conscious and oriented. Jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: bibasal crackles. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, without visceromegaly. Lower limbs: oedema with pretibial fovea ++.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood cultures: 4 positive samples for Streptococcus anginosus. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram: multiple vegetations at aortic level (the largest measuring 10 x 8 mm) and an inhomogeneous thickening, perivalvular and with an echodense appearance corresponding to an abscess of the aortic annulus measuring 3.6 x 2.3 cm. Cardiac CT: in addition to the above, two small pseudoaneurysms were observed at subvalvular level. 18F-FDG PET/CT: pathological deposit of activity around the aortic prosthesis with greater intensity in the posterior region and absence of uptake in the cardiac pacing system.  EVOLUTION Given the presence of an uncontrolled infection (aortic abscess) the patient underwent valve replacement surgery. Prior to the procedure, a PET/CT scan was performed to assess the involvement of the pacemaker generator and leads and to decide whether or not to replace the pacing system. Given the results of the test, it was finally decided not to remove the pacemaker. Postoperative evolution was satisfactory, antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was continued for a further 20 days and follow-up echocardiograms showed no complications. During subsequent clinical visits, the patient did not report fever or dyspnoea.  DIAGNOSIS Late infective endocarditis on biological aortic prosthesis, due to Streptococcus anginosus, complicated with aortic perivalvular abscess. Valve replacement surgery. Carrier of bicameral pacemaker due to advanced atrioventricular block, with no evidence of infection of the device. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 58-year-old woman consulted in the emergency department for dyspnoea.  BACKGROUND: No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: no hypertension (HT), no diabetes mellitus (DM), no dyslipidaemia (DLP). Ex-smoker of 10 cig/day for 10 years. Occasional alcohol (1 beer on weekends). No relevant medical history. Intervened for hallux valgus in October 2017. She does not follow usual treatment.  CURRENT ILLNESS: 58-year-old woman consulted for dyspnoea for 2-3 days with accompanying palpitations. She reported worsening of functional class with dyspnoea on moderate exertion not previously present, no orthopnoea or episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. She reported feeling more swollen, with increased oedema in both ankles. This symptomatology is sometimes accompanied by palpitations. She denies fever and infectious symptoms at any level. Until now she had been asymptomatic and reported being in good health, although two months ago, during a work check-up, she was found to have a murmur which she has not paid any attention to.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 125/66 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 140 bpm, oxygen saturation 94% at baseline. Afebrile. Jugular venous engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic, mitral systolic murmur II/IV. Pulmonary auscultation: minimal crackles in right base, rest of pulmonary auscultation normal. Lower extremities: oedema with bimalleolar fovea, rest normal.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS: haemoglobin 12.4 mg/dl. Haematocrit 38.1%. Leukocytosis 9,760 x 1000 with normal formula. Platelets 235,000 /ml. Coagulation: INR 1.08; PT 13.2 sg APTT 23.2 sg. Biochemistry: glucose 125 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.92 mg/dl. Urea 53 mg/dl. Sodium 135 mmol/l. Potassium 4.1 mmol/l. Liver profile normal. CRP 21.9 mg/dl. ProBNP 2841 pg/ml. CARDIAC MARKERS: troponin T and CPK normal, without serum changes. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: cardiothoracic index at the upper limit of normality. Right pleural effusion with pinching of the sinocostophrenic sinus. Fluid in the cisuras. Electrocardiogram (ECG): atrial fibrillation (AF) at 140 bpm with right bundle branch block (RBBB) and left anterior hemiblock (LABB). CLINICAL COURSE After a first episode of HF related to recently diagnosed AF with high ventricular rate, diuretic treatment, anticoagulation and beta-blocker treatment were started to control the heart rate, and the patient was admitted to cardiology for study and management. During his admission to the cardiology ward, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle slightly dilated (85 ml/cm2) with normal wall thickness. Global and segmental systolic function preserved. Severely dilated left atrium (100 ml/cm2). Large mass (area 13.6 cm2) hyperechogenic with partial calcification, with very friable edges, prolapsing inside the LV and preventing proper closure of the mitral valve. Probable point of anchorage at the level of the interatrial septum below and posterior to the foramen ovale. Normal sized right chambers with preserved ejection fraction (RVEF). Trivial tricuspid insufficiency allowing estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP) of 38 mmHg. Anatomically and functionally normal aortic valve. Mitral valve with thickening of both leaflets, difficult to assess anatomically due to the imprint of the left atrial mass. Severe mitral insufficiency, eccentric jet. Inferior vena cava of normal size with physiological inspiratory collapse. Aortic root, ascending aorta and infrarenal abdominal aorta of normal size. Absence of pericardial effusion. In view of the echocardiographic findings, the need for surgical intervention was discussed with the patient. Coronary angiography was performed, showing right dominance and coronary arteries without lesions. The patient was scheduled for cardiac surgery where a voluminous tumour with a wide implantation base was visualised. The anterior mitral leaflet was compromised at A1-A2 and the anterior mitral annulus, making valve repair impossible, and a St. Jude type mechanical prosthesis no. 29 was implanted. The anatomopathological report shows a mesenchymal lesion of low histological aggressiveness in which the hyallino-myxoid stroma predominates on which small cell groups with little cytological atypia float, although some present hyperchromatic nuclei, with abundant thin-walled vessels. No mitotic figures or foci of necrosis are observed. Areas of dystrophic calcification are observed. Pathological diagnosis: cardiac myxoma.  DIAGNOSIS Intracardiac mass. Cardiac myxoma. First episode of HF. Newly diagnosed AF with rapid ventricular response. CHADS-VASC 2 Arterial hypertension. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 73-year-old patient. Allergies: idiosyncrasy to multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Only cardiovascular risk factor: hypertensive. Arthrosis. Cataract surgery. No previous known cardiological history. No family history of heart disease or sudden death. She leads an active life with good functional class. Of interest, her husband had been discharged from our service 15 days ago for acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation (STEACS).  CURRENT ILLNESS: She came to the emergency department for presenting, after doing household chores, with oppressive central thoracic pain radiating to the neck, lasting about 30 minutes, with progressive spontaneous decrease but without disappearing, for which she took a caffeine sl from her husband, with complete disappearance of the symptoms. No accompanying vegetative cortex. No previous similar episodes. No episodes of syncope or presyncope. Usual New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I, although in the last two weeks she reported dyspnoea on moderate exertion.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 140/68. Heart rate (HR) 98 bpm. Oxygen saturation 99% baseline. Afebrile. Eupneic at rest. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, systolic murmur in lower left parasternal border that increases after Valsalva. Pulmonary auscultation: normoventilation. Abdomen: soft and depressible. No masses or megaliths. No oedema in the lower extremities. No IY. No carotid murmurs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: no pleuroparenchymal findings of acute evolution. ECG (asymptomatic): sinus rhythm at 83 bpm, narrow QRS with hypertrophy criteria in high lateral face with growth of R, secondary repolarisation alterations in anterolateral face and deep Q waves in V1-3. No dynamic changes. ANALYTICS: Tn I 0,28 -->2.20-->0,88. Glu 126 mg/dl, urea 38 mg/dl, creat 0.69 mg/dl, Na 142 mEq/l, K 4.3 mEq/l. Leukocytes 9400 mm3 (81% N), Hb 14.4 g/dl, Hto 45.5%, Platelets 155000/mm3. Coagulation: normal. Thyroid function: normal. Iron metabolism: normal. Hb 1AC 5.5%. LDL 80 mg/dl, HDL 33 mg/dl. Echocardiogram: non-dilated LV, ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) at basal septal level (sigmoid septum, 16 mm), rest of segments mild concentric LVH. Mild LV dysfunction (estimated by Teicholz and Simpson biplanar 49-50%), mid and apical septal akinesia and inferoapical, rest of segments preserved contractility. Acceleration of flow in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) with maximum baseline obstructive gradient 100 mmHg that increases with Valsalva manoeuvres up to 120 mmHg. Mitral filling pattern: impaired relaxation, with current data of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Left atrium (LA) slightly dilated. Right chambers not dilated, right ventricle (RV) normocontractile (TAPSE 19 mm, S' wave in lateral TDI 11.7 cm/sec). Aortic root and visualised portion of proximal ascending aorta normal. Mitral valve (MV) thin leaflets, correct opening. Complete SAM is observed generating MI with eccentric direction directed towards the AIS, reaching the roof of the left atrium (LA) without correctly visualising flow in the pulmonary veins, which appears significant (high Doppler intensity, although E wave < 1.2 cm/sec). Aortic valve (VAo) trivalve, thin leaflets, correct opening, not stenotic (Grad max 18 mmHg), competent. Tricuspid insufficiency (TI). Grad VD-AD 27 mmHg. Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated with preserved inspiratory collapse. Estimated normal systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs). Absence of pericardial effusion, without intracavitary masses through this access route. CORONARYGRAPHY: coronary arteries without significant angiographic lesions. Intramyocardial segment of mid LAD causing extrinsic compression in systole without generating severe milking. Ventriculography: severe hypokinesia of apical and middle segments of diaphragmatic and anterolateral face with hypercontractility of basal segments. Moderate LV dysfunction. MI grade I-II. CARDIAC MRI: LV of normal size, with normal systolic function (EF 52%). Basal septal hypertrophy of 16 mm maximum thickness with signs of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. No areas of late enhancement are evident in the myocardial thickness. Signs of MI with mild LA dilatation. ECHOCARDIOGRAM prior to discharge: the echocardiogram was repeated on the ward after starting the dose of beta-blocker, finding a baseline gradient of 64 mmHg which increased to 100 mmHg with Valsava, with other findings similar to the previous echo, with no clear improvement in contractile asymmetries but with less hyperdynamia of the basal segments and preserved LV systolic function (50-55%).  CLINICAL EVOLUTION At first it was treated as acute coronary syndrome. However, the patient was allergic to aspirin and trifusal. It was decided to perform a diagnostic cardiac catheterisation under treatment with clopidogrel and, if there were lesions, to subsequently perform aspirin desensitisation prior to performing coronary intervention. Coronary angiography showed epicardial coronary arteries without lesions and ventriculography showed severe hypokinesia of apical and middle segments of the diaphragmatic and anterolateral face with hypercontractility of basal segments with moderate LV dysfunction. With these findings, the first clinical suspicion was of tako-tsubo syndrome due to segmental asymmetries, history of stress (recent admission of her husband), elevated necrosis markers and epicardial coronary arteries without lesions. Treatment with beta-blocker (bisoprolol) was started progressively up to 10 mg/24 hours with good clinical tolerance. The patient did not present heart failure during admission and remained asymptomatic. Platelet antiplatelet therapy was withdrawn. Given the diagnostic doubt with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which showed no areas of late enhancement in the myocardial thickness and no evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The septum was 16 mm with normal remaining segments. At 30 days post-discharge, the patient presented NYHA functional class I and remained asymptomatic. Physical examination showed no congestive signs and no auscultation of a murmur. The ECG showed disappearance of Q waves with negative T waves in inferior and precordial leads. Echocardiogram in consultation showed LVEF 65%, without segmental asymmetries. The LVOT gradient was 10 mmHg and 24 mmHg after Valsalva. MR was mild. The patient was referred to the cardiology department for follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Tako-tsubo syndrome with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and significant MR due to SAM in a patient with septal LVH. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Background No known allergies. Glaucoma. Knee arthritis, under treatment with corticoids, attended acupuncture treatment for pain management. No CVRF. Present illness The patient attended the Emergency Department for low back pain and was discharged the same day with a diagnosis of low back pain and normal complementary tests (blood tests, spinal X-ray). Seven days later, she returned to the Emergency Department with generalised asthenia, fever (not quantified at home), stiff neck and back, papular lesions on the lower limbs, pain and redness in the left knee, weight loss of 8 kg in 3-4 months, associated with general malaise. She was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department, with initial suspicion of meningitis, for which empirical antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. A CT scan of the brain, lumbar puncture and synovial fluid were performed. In view of the negative results and progressive worsening of the patient, an assessment by Cardiology was requested on suspicion of bacterial endocarditis, a diagnosis confirmed by echocardiogram and positive blood cultures.  Physical examination On arrival at the ED: Ta 38°C, BP 130/80 mmHg, SatO2 95% on room air, HR 115 bpm. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. Neck: marked stiffness on movement. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Extremities: slight peripheral oedema, red nodular lesions, 3 mm in diameter, on the lower extremities. Kerning and Brudzinski: negative.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC in the ED: leukocytes 28,500 /uL, neutrophils 97 %, Hb 13.9 g/dl, HtO 41.7 %, platelets 159,000 /uL, glucose 163 mg/dl, urea 61 mg/dl, creatinine 0.54 mg/dl, Na 130 mEq/l, K 3.9 mEq/l, CRP 33.86 mg/dl. CSF culture: negative. Blood culture: Staphylococcus aureus, sensitive to methicillin. Thoracic-abdominal CT scan: bilateral pleural effusion with bilateral basal passive lung collapse. No significant alterations were identified in the rest of the lung parenchyma. Mild splenomegaly of 122 mm. Small peripheral hypovascular areas of triangular morphology suggestive of small infarcts. There are two small 15 mm accessory spleens adjacent to the lower pole. Small retroperitoneal, retrocrural and left external iliac chain lymphadenopathies. The size and morphology of the kidneys are preserved. Cortical cyst of 28 mm in the upper pole of the left kidney. Abdominal aorta of normal calibre. Diffuse increase of intestinal pneumatization. Redundant colic frame, with abundant faeces inside. Small amount of free fluid in the small pelvis. In view of progressive deterioration of general condition and suspicion of septic embolism both in the spleen and lower limbs, plus positive blood culture with no response to treatment, it was decided to transfer her to the ICU and she was assessed by TTE and TEE. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated LV with normal wall thickness. Preserved LVEF, no segmental asymmetries of contractility. Diastolic pattern of impaired relaxation. RV of normal size and function (TAPSE 21 mm). Aortic valve: mobile pedunculated image up to 2 cm in length prolapsing in LVOT that seems to depend on the left coronary leaflet/mitro-aortic junction, with some other small image of lesser length over the leaflets. No valvular restriction and mild reflux. No images of abscesses over the aortic root by this access route. Mitral valve: anterior leaflet slightly thickened, with no clear images of vegetations on the leaflets. Central reflux in the form of several grade II jets. Tricuspid valve with suboptimal visualisation, no apparent images of endocarditis, no insufficiency. Prominent Eustachian valve. Slight pericardial effusion of about 5-6 mm, mild collapse of the RA. No other signs of haemodynamic compromise. Non-dilated IVC with normal collapse. Transesophageal echocardiogram: LV of normal size and wall thickness. Good systolic function and no contractile asymmetries. On the ventricular wall adjacent to the antero-lateral mitral commissure and in relation to the proximal mitral subvalvular apparatus, a thick mass of anarchic movement of at least 2 cm in length is visualised, which is introduced in its movement towards the LV outflow tract, reaching the VAo plane (touching the ventricular side of the right coronary leaflet). Mitral valve: thin leaflets, without calcium and without apparent alterations in its kinetics. On the atrial side of P1-A1 there are several images of anarchic movement, the largest of approximately 1 cm. Slight central reflux and another that seems to originate from a small perforation of the posterior leaflet, at the level of P1. Aortic valve: trivalve, with thin leaflets without apparent images suggestive of vegetations on the leaflets. In the right coronary sinus there is a hypoechoic mobile image that seems to be a false image/reverberation of the mass coming from the ventricular wall. Slight reflux of central origin and eccentric jet towards the AIS. There are no images suggestive of abscesses or other complications on the root or mitro-aortic junction. No fistulae to the right chambers. Right chambers not dilated. Good RV function. On the lateral wall of the RA and about 2 cm from the tricuspid valve plane, there was a thick mass with similar characteristics to the one seen on the ventricular wall, very long (almost 3 cm long) and with an anarchic movement towards the tricuspid plane. It is introduced in its movement in the valvular plane without producing any alteration in valvular function. From transgastric access, the leaflets of the TV are thin, with no apparent images suggesting vegetations on them. IT is not adequately visualised to estimate PAPs. Pulmonary valve with thin leaflets and no images suggestive of vegetations. Slight pericardial effusion with no evidence of haemodynamic repercussions.  EVOLUTION The patient presented progressive deterioration of general condition. Blood pressure figures were adequate, although she was tachycardic, tachypneic, with a poor general appearance, so she was transferred to the ICU, where antibiotic treatment was modified, replacing vancomycin with daptomycin, and emergency surgery was performed. She arrived in the operating theatre hypotensive, tachypnoeic and cloudy, with haemodynamic instability throughout the surgical procedure, requiring the infusion of vasoactive drugs (noradrenaline, dobutamine, vasopressin) at high doses, associated with significant intraoperative coagulopathy. Surgical findings included: vegetation in the free wall of the RA approximately 3 cm long; vegetation in the posterior wall of the LV, which protruded through the aortic valve; trivalva of thin, non-calcified leaflets; impacting with the same at the level of the non-coronary leaflet, with minimal changes in the leaflet. It was decided to replace the valve with a mechanical prosthesis. Mitral subvalvular abscess, at the level of the anterior commissure, lateral to LV vegetation, with the need for reconstruction of the tissue, using prolene stitches supported by a Teflon patch. Perforation of fine mitral leaflet, without calcium, with small vegetations in the leaflet, valve replacement by mechanical prosthesis was performed. In the immediate postoperative period, haemodynamic instability persisted. On examination, transient right anisocoria was detected, so a window of sedation was performed where he presented tonic-clonic crises, so sedation was restarted, anti-combustion treatment, and no haemorrhagic or ischaemic signs were observed in the cranial CAT scan. He presented progressive and rapid multi-organ deterioration, with acute renal failure requiring renal function replacement therapy by haemofiltration and haemodynamic failure. In the presence of bilateral mydriasis arreactiva, sedation was withdrawn and the clinical examination and EEG were compatible with brain death. Vasoactive drugs were withdrawn and the patient died.  DIAGNOSIS Mural endocarditis and valvular endocarditis on native mitral valve due to Staphylococcus aureus. Septic embolisms. Heart failure. Emergent surgery. Poor postoperative evolution with multiorgan failure and exitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 63-year-old male. No known drug allergies. Personal history: exobabies, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome subtype CRDM (refractory cytopenias with multilinear dysplasia) followed up by haematology. Ischaemic heart disease of debut in 1996 in the form of acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI) posteroinferior. Inferior re-infarction in 1999 and in June 2006 with syncope and lacunar cerebrovascular accident (CVA). On admission in 2006 he was diagnosed with multivessel coronary artery disease with slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function and severe aortic stenosis, and it was decided to perform surgical coronary revascularisation and aortic valve replacement. In December 2006, aortic valve replacement with mechanical prosthesis and triple aortocoronary bypass with revascularisation of the LAD with IMA and PD and 1st marginal with two saphenous vein fragments. Follow-up in outpatient cardiology clinics in usual New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II. In the last year and a half, progressive deterioration of functional class with progressively decreasing dyspnoea on exertion and oedematisation of the lower limbs (lower extremities). Last echocardiogram in November 2016: left ventricle (LV) of normal size. Mild septal hypertrophy, preserved systolic function with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) around 55%, akinesia of the inferior wall, the rest of the segments without contractility alterations. Normofunctioning mitral valve (MV). Mechanical prosthesis in aortic position with adequate opening, moderate periprosthetic insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI). Estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs) of 45 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Under home treatment with: acenocoumarol according to guideline, atorvastatin 10 mg every 24 hours, omeprazole 20 mg every 24 hours, glimepiride 4 mg every 24 hours, metformin/vildagliptin 850/50 mg every 12 hours, ezetimibe 10 mg every 24 hours, ferrous sulphate 80 mg every 24 hours, ivabradine 5 mg every 12 hours, furosemide 40 mg every 24 hours, spironolactone 50 mg every 24 hours.  CURRENT ILLNESS: The patient comes to the ED for frank clinical worsening in the last month with dyspnoea on minimal effort, bendopnoea, increased abdominal perimeter and oedematisation of EEII. No clear orthopnoea or DPN. He also reported the appearance of oppressive, continuous precordial pain, of about three days' evolution, without irradiation or accompanying vegetative cortex. No dietary transgressions or apparent intercurrent infectious process.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure (BP) 115/60 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm, oxygen saturation 93% with GN at 2 bpm. Afebrile. Normohydrated with icteric staining of skin and conjunctivae. Conversational dyspnoea, no respiratory work at rest. Jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, prosthetic sounds with diastolic murmur in aortic and left parasternal focus. Pulmonary auscultation: discrete bibasal hypophonesis, without crackles or other added pathological sounds. Abdomen was globular, with collateral circulation, no clear ascitic surge and hepatomegaly of 3 traverses. The lower extremities showed oedema with fovea up to the middle third of both legs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 83 bpm, PR 190 ms, known LBBB with secondary repolarisation alterations. ANALYTICS on admission: ProBNP 1,919 pg/ml, glucose 72 mg/dl, urea 40 mg/dl, creatinine 0.97 mg/dl, sodium 134 mEq/l, potassium 3.8 mEq/l. Leukocytes 3,400/ml (76.8% neutrophils), Hb 11.4 gr/dl, Hto 35.5%, platelets 59,000/mm3. INR 3.96. THORAX X-RAY: global cardiomegaly. Aortic valve prosthesis. Mid sternotomy sutures. Increase of interstitial tissue of probable vascular origin. No consolidative foci or pleural effusion. Dorsal spondylosis with calcification of the anterior vertebral ligament. Transthoracic echocardiogram on admission: LV of normal size and moderate concentric hypertrophy. Normal global LV systolic function; flattened septal motion probably related to previous surgery and right overload, inferobasal and medial inferior akinetic eschar. Restrictive diastolic pattern, with data suggestive of elevated LVEDP. Slight biauricular dilatation. Right ventricle (RV) of preserved size and contractility. Aortic root and visualised portion of proximal ascending aorta of normal size. MV: thin leaflets, not limited in its opening and mild central mitral insufficiency (MI). Aortic prosthesis: opening of occluders, gradients similar to previous studies, normal Doppler velocity index (IVT TSVI/Ao ratio: 0.47) and wide periprosthetic reflux, eccentric, running parallel to the interventricular septum, originating in the theoretical right coronary sinus (around 11:00 hours), short THP, holodiastolic inversion in descending thoracic aorta with end-diastolic velocity < 20 cm/s (18 cm/s) and only protodiastolic inversion in abdominal aorta, for all these reasons it is classified as grade III-IV/IV. A semilunar image is observed adjacent to the theoretical right coronary sinus, echodense, where the leak originates, which could be the origin of the leak. Light TI. Dilated inferior vena cava (IVC) with absence of inspiratory collapse. Severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Mild PE allowing estimation of a mean PAP of 51 mmHg (31 mmHg + 20 mmHg DBP). Perihepatic fluid. Absence of pericardial effusion and intracavitary masses via this access route. Conclusions: moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Normal LVEF, with segmental asymmetries. Restrictive diastolic pattern. Mild MI. Grade III-IV/IV aortic periprosthetic leak. Severe PHT. Transesophageal echocardiogram: left atrium without thrombus inside. Left atrial appendage without thrombus. Atrial septum intact. Aortic prosthesis: correct movement of hemidiscs, gradients similar to previous studies, Doppler velocity index within normality and two physiological intraprosthetic refluxes for prosthesis. A crescentic image was observed between the theoretical right coronary sinus and non-coronary sinus, between 9:00 and 12:00 hours, of about 0.5 cm2 area, suggesting prosthetic dehiscence at this level and from which originates aortic periprosthetic leak with wide jet that runs parallel to the interventricular septum and deepens in LV reaching papillary muscles, with short THP, holodiastolic inversion in descending thoracic aorta with end-diastolic velocity > 20 cm/s, without observing reverse flow in abdominal aorta, for all these reasons it is classified as grade III-IV/IV. Mitro-aortic junction and periaortic region with normal echoic characteristics, without images suggesting abscesses or other periannular complications. Other findings superimposable to transthoracic study. Conclusions: grade III-IV/IV aortic periprosthetic leak. Moderate LVH. Normal LVEF, with segmental asymmetries. Restrictive diastolic pattern. Severe PHT. ECHOCARDIOGRAM after percutaneous closure procedure: aortic prosthesis: gradient improvement, currently maximum of 32 mmHg. Several periprosthetic leaks are seen (one at 11 hours and another at 3 hours) overall of somewhat lower grade than in the previous study but still grade III/IV (THP 280-310 ms, holodiastolic reversal of flow in isthmus and left femoral artery). Mild TR allowing estimation of PAPs 47 mmHg. IVC currently not dilated with normal collapse. Mild PI allowing an estimated mean PAP of 25 mmHg. Current absence of pericardial effusion. Rest of study unchanged from previous. Conclusions: Moderate eccentric LVH. Preserved LVEF. Inferobasal akinesia. AIo III/IV. Moderate PHT.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Clinical improvement during admission with loss of 13 kg of weight, decrease in abdominal perimeter and disappearance of oedema under intravenous perfusion of loop diuretic and inotropes. Given the persistence of jaundice together with sustained high bilirubin levels and slight elevation of GGT, FA and LDH, an abdominal ultrasound was performed showing hepatomegaly suggestive of chronic liver disease and splenomegaly. The echocardiogram showed severe aortic insufficiency which was confirmed by TEE (performed after depletive treatment), visualising a grade IIIIV/IV periprosthetic aortic leak with severe pulmonary hypertension. In view of these findings, the case was presented at a medical-surgical session and, given the patient's comorbidity, percutaneous closure of the periprosthetic leak was considered the best option. During admission, closure of the aortic paravalvular leak was performed. The procedure was very difficult due to the difficulty in advancing the guidewires through the leak, achieving partial closure of the leak by means of a ductus closure device. There were no complications in the vascular access and the patient remained haemodynamically stable at all times. Subsequent evolution was good, and a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed an improvement in aortic regurgitation, although a grade II/IV periprosthetic leak persisted with a decrease in pulmonary pressure, for which reason he was discharged. The patient is currently under outpatient follow-up by the heart failure team, having required only one hospital admission since then for decompensated heart failure in the context of respiratory infection.  DIAGNOSIS Right-sided congestive heart failure. Periprosthetic aortic leak with grade III-IV/IV insufficiency, with partial closure by percutaneous procedure. Chronic ischaemic heart disease. Myelodyspastic syndrome (anaemia + thrombopenia). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): High blood pressure (HBP) under treatment and smoker of one pack a day. No relevant medical history. Previous surgeries: appendectomy 20 years ago. Current treatment: enalapril 10 mg every 12 hours. Baseline life: independent for basic activities of daily living. Family history: father with sudden death at the age of 60.  CURRENT ILLNESS: 44-year-old male patient brought by SUMMA to the emergency department for sudden syncope recovered while walking in the street. He reported atypical chest pain in the previous 72 hours, intermittent, which appeared at rest and was not accompanied by vegetative cortex. There were no symptoms of heart failure or palpitations. No other clinical manifestations due to apparatus. On arrival at the emergency department, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed. Haemodynamically unstable, urgent TTE was performed, showing cardiac tamponade secondary to cardiac rupture. Orotracheal intubation was performed, a central line was placed, inotropic support was started and pericardiocentesis was performed but failed, and the cardiac surgeon was notified for urgent surgery to evacuate the effusion and implant a pericardial patch. After surgery, he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further care. During his admission to the ICU, coronary angiography was performed showing left coronary artery without significant lesions and critical stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA), with image of partially recanalised thrombus and distal TIMI 1 flow, to IVP is partially filled by collateral circulation from IC. Medical treatment of the lesion was decided for the time being. After a month of hospitalisation, extubated, clinically and haemodynamically stable, he was discharged to the cardiology ward.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: IOT, regularly perfused, tachypneic. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, tachycardic, no murmurs, muffled tones. Pulmonary auscultation: bilateral crackles. Lower limbs: no oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS: Hb 10g/dl. Platelets 228.000/ml, leukocytes 26.000/ml. 89% neutrophils. INR 1.7. Urea 32 mg/dl. Cr 0.76 mg/dl. Na 136. K 4.3 mEq/l. pH 7.21, lactic 1.2 mmol/l, CK 3,000 mmol/l, TnT 600 ng/dl. Urgent TTE (postoperative, ICU): severe biventricular dysfunction at the expense of inferior and inferolateral akinesia and dyskinesia of the basal segments. Mild ischaemic mitral insufficiency (MI). Mild pericardial effusion. CORONARYGRAPHY: critical proximal DC stenosis, with image of partially recanalised thrombus, and distal TIMI 1 flow. IVP is filled by collateral circulation from the left coronary artery. Left coronary tree without significant lesions. TTE ruled (cardiology floor): severely dilated left ventricle (LV). Severe LV dysfunction with hypokinesia of all segments and akinesia of the inferior face, large posterobasal aneurysm with partial thrombosis of the cavity. Right ventricular (RV) systolic function at the lower limit of normality. MRI (cardiology floor): dilated LV with large lateral wall pseudoaneurysm, at the level of surgical repair of LV free wall rupture. The pseudoaneurysm measures: 66 x 41 mm (lateral and inferolateral extension). There are no images suggestive of thrombus inside the pseudoaneurysm. Lateral wall thinned, with lateral and inferior akinesia. The rest of the walls with septal thickness within the normal range. Contractility preserved at the level of the anterior wall, septum and mid-apical and basal lateral wall. Global systolic function severely depressed 19%. Late gadolinium enhancement study with transmural enhancement area in inferior and lateral face respecting apical segments of both faces. RV with size, thickness and global and segmental contractility within normal limits. Global systolic function lower limit of normality (51%). Left pleural effusion.  Conclusions: LV with large lateral and inferolateral pseudoaneurysm with lateral and inferior akinesia. Global systolic function severely depressed. Transmural enhancement in inferior and lateral face respecting apical segments of both faces. Left pleural effusion. Lateral and inferolateral pseudoaneurysm 66 x 41mm. Transmural enhancement in inferior and lateral face, respecting apical segment of both faces. LVEF 20%. Intracavitary thrombus. CT scan (cardiology ward): ascending thoracic aorta: 30 x 32 mm. Descending thoracic aorta: 20 x 20 mm. Findings: on the inferolateral side, a ventricular pseudoaneurysm is identified, consisting of a rupture contained by a surgical patch of pericardium, measuring 64 x 41 x 73 mm with a neck of 54 x 59 mm (measured from the basal and papillary segment). The pericardial patch cannot be properly individualised and the most apical portion of the structure could be constituted by myocardial wall. The papillary muscle has its base just distal to the pseudoaneurysm. A 4 mm filling defect is identified inside the pseudoaneurysm, which could correspond to a small thrombus. No pericardial effusion was detected. No other extracardiac findings. Summary: Inferolateral ventricular pseudoaneurysm measuring 64 x 41 x 73 mm with a neck of 54 x 59 mm (see description). Small intracavitary thrombus. Absence of pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In the cardiology ward, complementary tests were carried out and showed, in summary, severe ventricular dysfunction with pseudoaneurysm in the LV measuring 66 x 41 mm. Treatment was optimised and enalapril 10 mg c/12 hours, metoprolol 50 mg c/12 hours, aldactone 25 mg c/24 hours and ivabradine 7.5 mg c/12 hours were prescribed with good tolerance. The case was presented at a medical-surgical session where the following options were proposed: medical treatment and follow-up, implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), surgical resection of the pseudoaneurysm and cardiac transplant. Finally, it was decided to resect the pseudoaneurysm with very good clinical evolution and follow-up in consultations. Currently, the patient has recovered LVEF to 42% in the last TTE with New York Heart Association (NHYA) functional class I and free of admissions since discharge.

HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 53-year-old male, dyslipidaemic and ex-smoker, asymptomatic from a cardiovascular point of view, who was referred to the cardiology department for a chance finding on electrocardiogram. As for his family history, his paternal family has a multiple history of heart disease at an early age: the patient's father received a heart transplant in 1995 for non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy, his paternal grandfather died at the age of 60 due to an unspecified heart problem, and two of his father's siblings (one male and one female) suffer from dilated cardiomyopathy and are implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD-CRT) cardiac resynchronisation therapy patients. Among the patient's siblings, the case of a woman with dilated cardiomyopathy associated with an atrial septal defect is documented. The rest of her siblings, as well as her daughters, are asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view. Physical examination reveals no pathological findings.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 72 bpm. Intraventricular conduction disorder, with QRS 116 msec. Repolarisation alterations consisting of negative T from V3 to V6. ANALYTICS: LDL (Friedewald estimation) 138 mg/dl, without other notable alterations. Transthoracic echocardiogram (December 2014): left ventricle not dilated or hypertrophied. Moderately to severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (36% by Simpson biplane) overall. There was a slight increase in trabeculation at the level of the apex, without criteria of non-compaction cardiomyopathy (ecopotentiator administered). Non-dilated right ventricle, increased trabeculation with slight hypokinesia in apical and basal segments with preserved contractility. Mild biauricular dilatation (left atrium 22 cm2, right atrium 17 cm2). Inferior vena cava not dilated. No pericardial effusion. Slightly thickened aortic valve with preserved mobility, minimal insufficiency. Mild mitral insufficiency. No tricuspid insufficiency allowing estimation of systolic pulmonary pressure (SPP). No pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI (2018): LV not dilated or hypertrophic. Normal global and segmental contractility. Apical hypertrabeculation without criteria of noncompaction cardiomyopathy. No areas of uptake on late enhancement sequences suggestive of fibrosis. HOLTER: stable sinus rhythm with good heart rate range. Low-medium intensity ventricular extrasystoles with right ventricular outflow tract morphology. No pathological pauses or blockages. CORONARYGRAPHY: coronary arteries without significant lesions. Right dominance. GENETIC STUDY: the sample was sent for NGS study (panel of 81 genes). The study found a probably pathogenic variant: p.Arg5902* mutation in heterozygosis in the TTN gene: NP_003310.4: p.Arg5902*, M_003319.4: c.17704C>T, NC_000002.11g.179487411G>A). The G>A nucleotide substitution at chromosomal position g.179487411 results in the substitution of an arginine for a premature stop codon affecting most TTN isoforms.  CLINICAL COURSE Following echocardiographic findings of moderate to severely depressed systolic function, treatment with low-dose bisoprolol and ramipril was initiated and well tolerated. Since his diagnosis, the patient has remained asymptomatic, with no episodes of heart failure decompensation and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I. He is being followed up in cardiology consultations. He was followed up in cardiology consultations with annual control echocardiograms, having recovered in the last one up to a LVEF of 53%. A genetic study was performed on relatives, finding mutations in the TTN gene in one of her paternal aunts and in one of her sisters, both affected by dilated cardiomyopathy, which demonstrates cosegregation and confirms the pathogenicity of the mutation found.  DIAGNOSIS Non-ischemic familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Carrier of p.Arg5902* mutation in heterozygosis in the TTN gene, probably associated with the disease. Current LVEF 53%. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of a 56-year-old woman with a resynchronisation pacemaker who was admitted for device removal due to local infection.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: No known drug allergies. No known cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiological history: rheumatic valve disease with open mitral commissurotomy in 1988. Permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). VVI pacemaker holder since 1998 due to AF that was difficult to control, with generator replacement in 2008 due to battery depletion. Echocardiogram in 2013 showed a moderate-severe double rheumatic mitral lesion with predominant stenosis, with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and moderate pulmonary hypertension, severe tricuspid insufficiency (TI) and dilatation of the right ventricle (RV) with mild-moderate dysfunction. Surgical intervention was indicated, with mechanical mitral valve replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty, with good results. In the control echocardiogram one year later, the mitral prosthesis is normofunctioning, but a slightly dilated and dysfunctioning LV with LVEF 35% due to diffuse hypokinesia and anomalous septal movement in the context of stimulation is visualised. The patient's functional class worsened (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class III), so an upgrade to cardiac resynchronisation therapy was indicated in March 2015. Possible vertebrobasilar transient ischaemic attack (TIA) in 2012. Normal TSA Doppler. Myomatous uterus. Total hysterectomy + double adnexectomy in 2011. Usual treatment: synthroid, furosemide 40 mg c/24 hours, carvedilol 6.25 mg c/12 hours, spironolactone 25 mg c/24 hours, omeprazole, zolpidem. BFS: higher functions preserved. NYHA II.  CURRENT DISEASE: After the upgrade to cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT), the patient presented a torpid evolution of the surgical wound, with tension haematoma one month after implantation that required drainage, and subsequent dehiscence that required debridement and approximation of the edges. However, the patient did not evolve satisfactorily and, 5 months later, a subpectoral implant of the generator was indicated for decubitus, also requiring surgical debridement. He continued to be monitored in cardiac surgery consultations, with good evolution of the surgical wound until, in December 2017, he consulted the emergency department for pain in the area of the generator and increasing local oedema. She did not present fever or elevated infectious markers. She was subsequently assessed by cardiac surgery, which observed signs of incipient decubitus in the pectoral area, with significant skin retraction, without suppuration. Imaging tests were requested to complete the study and admission was indicated for the start of antibiotic treatment and removal of the resynchronisation device due to infection of the generator area.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Haemodynamically stable, well perfused. Eupneic. Afebrile. Good general condition. Head and neck: no IY. Chest: induration and pain on palpation in the left infraaxillary area, with skin retraction and trophic changes. No suppuration. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic, valvular click. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved ventricular murmur. Abdomen: soft and depressible, without pain or signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: AF with ventricular rhythm stimulated at 75 bpm. ANALYTICS: normal renal function with GFR > 90 ml/min and normal ions. CRP 11.8. Normal leukocytes with normal leukocyte formula. Hb 11.8 g/dl. Coagulation without findings. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): left ventricle (V) severely dilated by volumes. No visu asynchrony evident. LVEF 43%. Right ventricle (RV) normal with respect to size and function. Severely dilated left atrium (> 40 cm2). Moderately dilated right atrium. Mitral prosthesis with good opening and mitral insufficiency (MI) that appears to be intraprosthetic. Normofunctioning tricuspid annulus, with no residual TR so that pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) cannot be estimated. The aortic valve is trivalve, with rheumatic involvement. Mild-moderate valvular aortic stenosis. Mild-moderate aortic insufficiency. Aortic root of normal size. No pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): pacemaker lead in LV. Two leads are seen in the RA, following their course to the tricuspid valve without thickening suggestive of endocarditis. The intraventricular section cannot be assessed due to mitral acoustic shadowing. Bivalve mechanical prosthesis with good opening and intraprosthetic washout jets. No stigmata of endocarditis. Trivalve aortic valve. POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET/CT): Heterogeneous increase in activity (early maximum SUV around 4.3 and late around 5.7) around the pacemaker generator located in the left pectoral region and slight activity (early and late SUV around 2.5) in the proximal section of the exit of the pacemaker lead from the generator, in the subcutaneous trajectory reaching the clavicle. Findings that, considering the time that has elapsed since its placement and which are visualised in both the corrected and uncorrected images, suggest active infectious pathology. In the superior mediastinum, a small focal uptake deposit is identified, which shows greater activity in the late images (early SUV = 2.8 and late SUV = 3.8) at the level of the entrance of the pacemaker lead into the superior vena cava. In the clinical context, this finding suggests an active focus of infection. No other abnormal increases in activity were seen in the rest of the pacemaker lead or in the electrodes. There were no abnormal increases in activity at or around the mitral valve suggesting infection-endocarditis. In the left axilla there are several subcentimetre-sized lymphadenopathies with mild activity (maximum early and late SUV around 1.2) that may correspond to residual or reactive lymphadenopathies that are not very active. One lymph node stands out for its size (maximum diameter around 13mm) which shows greater activity (early SUV = 1.7 and late SUV = 2.6) which may be due to active inflammatory lymphadenopathy. No other abnormal increases in uptake were identified in the rest of the lymph node territories included in the study, both supra- and infradiaphragmatic. Radiotracer uptake in both lungs is within normal limits. The distribution of activity in the liver and spleen is homogeneous, with no abnormal increases in activity. No pathological findings in the adrenal glands or pancreas. Slight increase in activity along the sternum translating residual reactive changes due to a history of median sternotomy. In the rest of the bone structures included in the study, no abnormal increases in activity are visualised. Reinforcement of uptake adjacent to the right humeral head due to insertional pathology. No significant alterations in the uptake and distribution of the tracer were observed in the rest of the body regions studied. Conclusion: findings compatible with infectious pathology around the pacemaker generator, as well as in the proximal subcutaneous trajectory of the pacemaker lead and in its entry at the level of the superior vena cava in a more focal manner. Lymph node uptake in the left axilla suggestive of reactive-inflammatory ethology. ANGIO-CT coronary arteries: bicameral pacemaker with the end of the electrodes located in the RV and posterolateral vein. Patent coronary sinus of normal calibre. The posterolateral vein in which the electrode is lodged is of small calibre, and its patency cannot be assessed due to the artefact caused by the electrode. Inferolateral vein of good calibre, 5 mm in diameter, originating 12 mm from the valve of Tebesio and presenting a lateral direction towards the inferolateral segments of the LV, can be seen on the inferior face. Median sternotomy and triple valve replacement. Cardiomegaly. Pulmonary parenchyma without findings.  Conclusions: posterolateral vein in which the electrode is lodged is of small calibre and cannot be assessed due to artefacts caused by the electrode, and its patency cannot be assessed. Inferolateral vein of good calibre.  MICROBIOLOGICAL STUDY: Blood cultures (on admission): negative. Pan bacterial PCR 16S rRNA 31/1/18: not detected. Blood cultures (after episode of phlebitis): positive for Staphylococcus aureus without resistance, with negative results in control cultures after targeted antibiotherapy. Cultures of vascular material (extracted system): positive for Staphylococcus hominis (DV electrode and subcutaneous swab) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (LV lead, DV lead, subcutaneous swab and generator capsule). Negative control blood cultures.   CLINICAL COURSE After removal of a cardiac pacing device, it is recommended to re-evaluate the need for reimplantation of the same device or another device with greater or lesser functionalities. The challenge in this patient was to define whether she had responded to resynchronisation therapy, to indicate a resynchronising pacemaker again or, if not, a single-chamber pacing pacemaker. The patient was finally considered a clinical responder due to a slight improvement in functional class (NYHA III to II), but not a responder echocardiographically. Given the positive clinical response, reimplantation of a new cardiac resynchronisation device was indicated. During admission, the cardiac resynchronisation device was initially scheduled to be explanted and removed at the same time, with periprocedural antibiotic treatment, given that the patient remained afebrile, clinically and haemodynamically stable and without elevation of acute phase reactants. However, while awaiting surgery, she developed bacteraemia due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, secondary to phlebitis due to infection of a peripheral vein, so antibiotic therapy with vancomycin was started after drawing blood cultures, and withdrawal and reimplantation was indicated in two stages, after antibiotic therapy. During admission, the patient remained afebrile and haemodynamically stable at all times. Since the patient had a high percentage of pacing with a narrow QRS escape ventricular rhythm at 35 bpm, after removal of the resynchronisation system, a transient right jugular pacemaker was implanted while awaiting reimplantation of the permanent pacemaker. While admitted to the hospital ward, she lost capture due to dislocation of the electrode, which caused decompensation of heart failure requiring continuous isoproterenol perfusion and subsequent replacement of the transient pacing lead, with placement of a temporary active fixation electrode. After the repositioning procedure, she was admitted to the coronary unit, presenting acute pulmonary oedema that responded favourably to diuretic treatment, and she was discharged to the hospital ward in 48-72 hours, where she remained to complete the antibiotic regimen until the reimplantation of the definitive pacemaker. Finally, in a situation of clinical stability and after approximately 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment, with negative blood cultures, she was scheduled for resynchronisation pacemaker implantation. Unfortunately, the coronary sinus could not be cannulated after multiple attempts, so only one RV electrode connected to a resynchronisation generator was placed on the contralateral side. The patient was discharged home pending completion of intravenous antibiotic therapy. She is currently clinically stable, has not presented decompensation of heart failure and the control echocardiogram shows no worsening of LVEF. The patient's clinical evolution in the short-medium term is pending re-evaluation, with the aim of considering other therapeutic alternatives should she present poor clinical evolution, such as endocardial left ventricular stimulation, given that she is a patient with an indication for permanent anticoagulation.  DIAGNOSIS Local infection of the cardiac resynchronisation device. Removal of the complete system (generator and RV and LV leads). Implantation of transient right jugular pacemaker. Implantation of resynchronisation generator and right-sided RV electrode in a second stage. Right upper extremity phlebitis with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus bacteraemia. Dilated cardiomyopathy with moderate LV systolic dysfunction. Rheumatic valve disease with mitral prosthesis and tricuspid annulus without functional alterations. Double mild-moderate aortic lesion. Permanent AF. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Transthoracic echocardiography: ventricular septal defect due to rupture of the interventricular septum in the lower medial area where there is a solution of continuity and an anfractuous trajectory. A maximum gradient between LV and RV of 51 mmHg is determined and the width of the jet between both ventricles is 16 mm. A Qp/Qs of 2.2 is calculated. Dilatation of the right chambers and the left ventricle was observed and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% was estimated using Simpson's method. There is akinesia of the posterior wall and the basal and medial inferior septum. The aortic valve is slightly sclerosed, with a normal gradient. The mitral valve shows signs of annular fibrosis, preserved opening and grade II/IV, central insufficiency, probably related to the altered mobility of the ventricular wall. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI) is observed, which allows estimating a systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 49 mmHg. No significant pericardial effusion was observed.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction of probably inferior location. Coronary angiography showed thrombotic occlusion in the middle segment of the RCA, but given the chronology of the condition, the infarction was considered to be subacute, and therefore intervention was ruled out. Subsequently, the patient presented symptoms and signs of heart failure, and transthoracic echocardiography showed ventricular septal rupture with a maximum size of 16 mm, left-right shunt with a maximum gradient of 58 mmHg, overload of the right cavities, Qp/Qs of 2.2 and LVEF by Simpson of 38% with alterations in contractility in the RCA territory. The case was discussed with cardiac surgery and conservative management was decided jointly given the poor prognosis and comorbidity of the patient. The patient was transferred to the hospital ward on the third day and required occasional morphine rescue due to dyspnoea. Finally, given the situation of refractory heart failure, exclusively symptomatic treatment was established and the patient died on the eighth day of admission.  DIAGNOSIS Advanced acute inferior myocardial infarction. Thrombotic occlusion of non-revascularised middle right coronary artery. Ventricular septal rupture. Refractory heart failure. Death. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 78-year-old woman, a 25-pack-year ex-smoker with no other known cardiovascular risk factors or previous personal or family cardiological history, who presented with a history of polyarthralgia and Raynaud's phenomenon that had not been studied, on chronic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. He presented with symptoms of acute heart failure of three days' duration, with orthopnoea and oliguria, associated with oedematisation of the lower limbs. She denied chest pain or fever, but did recognise asthenia and loss of appetite in the last two months. The blood pressure (BP) on arrival at the ED was 158/97 mmHg and heart rate (HR) 97 bpm, saturating at 92% with Ventimask at 50% FiO2. Afebrile. Physical examination revealed poor general condition with respiratory distress and jugular ingurgitation, and cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed no murmurs, with crackles up to mid-pulmonary fields. There was also oedema in the lower limbs up to the middle third of the pretibial region. The presence of sclerodermic lesions on both hands and on the trunk is noteworthy.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ANALYTICS: glucose 136 mg/dl; urea 130 mg/dl; creatinine 3.76 mg/dl; glomerular filtration rate 10 ml/min (previously normal); uric acid 6.2 mg/dl; alkaline phosphatase 86 U/l; GPT 32 U/l; NT-proBNP 2745 pg/ml; C-reactive protein 28.3 mg/dl; haemoglobin 10.5 g/dl; leucocytes 7.8 x 10000/mm3; platelets 117 x 10000/mm3; ESR 125 mm/h; prothrombin rate 86%; urine sediment with proteinuria; basal blood gas with pH 7.34, pO2 55 mmHg, pCO2 34 mmHg. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 85 bpm with left bundle branch block. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: anteroposterior study with cardiomegaly and acute pulmonary oedema. Transthoracic echocardiography: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with mild concentric hypertrophy and prolonged diastolic relaxation pattern. LVEF 40%. Right ventricle (RV) slightly dilated with normal systolic function. Mild mitral insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating a RV-AD gradient of 42 mmHg. Moderate pericardial effusion without involvement of the right chambers or transmitral flow variation. HIGH RESOLUTION COMPUTATIONAL TOMOGRAPHY (HRCT): ground-glass images in both lower lobes in particular, suggesting pulmonary fibrosis. Increased pulmonary artery calibre (35 mm) suggesting pulmonary hypertension. CORONARYGRAPHY: epicardial arteries without significant angiographic lesions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Diagnosed with acute pulmonary oedema and acute renal failure, he was initially admitted to the acute cardiac care unit, where respiratory support measures were established with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, with good adaptation and achieving clinical and gasometric improvement two hours after starting treatment. However, oligoanuria persisted despite the initiation of intravenous diuretic treatment, so renal replacement therapy with haemofiltration was finally chosen, which facilitated water discharge and contributed to the patient's clinical improvement. Once the patient was initially stabilised, transthoracic echocardiography was performed, showing moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction without frank asynergies. With the presence of an unknown left bundle branch block (previous studies without intraventricular conduction disorders), a coronary angiographic study was performed, which showed no lesions in the epicardial bed. The patient subsequently evolved favourably, being able to dispense with ventilatory support and starting haemodialysis sessions due to persistent oligoanuria. The presence of sclerodermic skin lesions, pericardial effusion, pulmonary hypertension on echocardiography and acute renal failure led to the suspicion of an autoimmune disease, so an immunological study was requested which showed positivity for antitopoisomerase I antibodies (AntiScl-70), and a pulmonary imaging study with CAT scan showed bibasal pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis with signs of pulmonary hypertension. Treatment was started with glucocorticoids and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and continued with haemodialysis sessions, with echocardiographic monitoring showing only partial resolution of the pericardial effusion, with no other changes. Finally, in view of the favourable evolution, discharge home was decided.  DIAGNOSIS Acute pulmonary oedema. Moderate pericardial effusion. Moderate left ventricular dysfunction. Diffuse systemic sclerosis with scleroderma renal crisis. Interstitial lung disease with fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  BACKGROUND: 61-year-old woman. No known drug allergies. No cardiovascular risk factors or toxic habits. No family history of early ischaemic heart disease or sudden death. No previous cardiological history. Vitiligo. No other diseases of interest. No hospital admissions or surgical interventions No usual treatment.  CURRENT ILLNESS: Previously asymptomatic cardiovascular until the week prior to admission, which begins with pseudo-flu-like symptoms of myalgia, asthenia and dysthermic sensation with febrile fever. On the day of admission, she had two episodes of dizziness with associated vegetative cortex and subsequent syncope, with complete recovery within seconds. There was no associated chest pain or palpitations. She had not had previous syncopal episodes, nor did she present dyspnoea, orthopnoea, oliguria or oedema.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Arterial hypotension of 50/70 mmHg and tachycardia at 110 bpm were observed, together with signs of poor peripheral perfusion, with coldness and sweating. Afebrile. Cardiopulmonary auscultation with rhythmic heart sounds, without murmurs and preserved vesicular murmur without pathological sounds. Pulses present and symmetrical in all four extremities. No oedema or evidence of venous thrombosis in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG): sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, PR 140 ms, narrow QRS, with discrete J point elevation especially in inferior face and V5-V6, with slow progression of R in precordials and generalised decreased voltages. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY (admission): normal cardiothoracic index. No evidence of heart failure or visible condensation. THORAX RADIOGRAPHY (evolution): acute pulmonary oedema. ANALYSIS: CBC: leukocytes 6600/μl (70% neutrophils), Hb 13.6 g/dl, platelets 140,000/μl. Coagulation: INR 1, PT 96 %. Biochemistry: at baseline: glucose 145 mg/dl, urea 52 mg/dl, creatinine 1.03 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate 52 ml/min (CKD-EPI) [>60], K 4.5 mmol/l, Na 140 mmol/l, CK 151 U/l, ultrasensitive Troponin 24.4 ng/l. ProBNP 414 pg/ml. In the evolution: GOT 1.322 U/l, GPT 1.050 U/l, CK 3578 U/l, ultrasensitive troponin 5.001 ng/l, ProBNP 3.229 pg/ml, CRP 8,7 mg/dl. Transthoracic echocardiogram: hypertrophic left ventricle (interventricular septum 15 mm) with echodensity suggestive of infiltrative disease or inflammation, not dilated (end-systolic diameter 40 mm), with very severe depression of ejection fraction (LVEF 10-15 %) at the expense of global hypokinesia. Normal sized right ventricle with severe ventricular dysfunction (TAPSE 7). Normal sized left atrium. No significant valvular heart disease. Mild pericardial effusion. Ascending aorta of normal size. CARDIAC NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MRI): very artifactual study due to inadequate cooperation of the patient. Both ventricles are normal size with severe global hypokinesia and significant oedema and diffuse hyperemia, compatible with acute inflammatory pathology. There are no areas of late gadolinium uptake. No pericardial effusion. Minimal bilateral pleural effusions.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In a situation of arterial hypotension and poor peripheral perfusion with initial suspicion of acute myocarditis in cardiogenic shock, he was admitted to the coronary unit and haemodynamic support was started with dobutamine and noradrenaline. The day after admission, cardiac MRI was performed, confirming the suspected diagnosis. Progressive worsening in the following hours despite treatment with vasoactive amines at maximum tolerated doses, with clinical deterioration and onset of multi-organ failure, with oligoanuria, lactidemia greater than 6 nmol/l and increased liver damage enzymes. It was decided to place an aortic balloon pump and ECMO type veno-arterial circulatory support. In the following hours, there were persistent signs of poor distal perfusion and poor ventilation with pinkish expectoration through an orotracheal tube compatible with acute pulmonary oedema. He presented an episode of severe bradycardia and asystole, advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were performed, and he died on the third day of admission.  DIAGNOSIS Fulminant myocarditis. Very severe biventricular dysfunction (LVEF 10-15%). Cardiogenic shock with circulatory support with veno-arterial ECMO. Death. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 67-year-old male, ex-smoker with an accumulated rate of 50 packs/year, hypertension, dyslipidaemic and diabetic on insulin treatment, with a history of high-risk STEMI in February 2015 and implantation of three paclitaxel-eluting stents in the middle and distal right coronary artery (RCA) (Luc-Chopin®: 3x12 and 2.5x12 mm respectively), and in second time two other stents (Luc-Chopin®: 3x12 mm and 2.5x12 mm) to proximal anterior descending (AD) and middle. In October 2015, due to anginal symptoms, angiographic re-evaluation documented severe restenosis of previous stents, so new percutaneous resvascularisation was performed with implantation of three everolimus-eluting stents (XIENCE PRIME®), one in the proximal LAD (3x18 mm) and two overlapping stents in the middle and distal DC (3x28 mm, 2x25 mm). Having been asymptomatic for the last two years and taking double antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and prasugrel, on the day of admission he consulted for typical chest pain of 1.5 hours' duration. Physical examination revealed ERW. Mucocutaneous pallor. Normoperfused and normohydrated. Vitals: BP: 170/80 mmHg, O2 Sat: 96 % (GFN at 2 bpm). Afebrile. Jugular ingurgitation at 45o. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs or friction sounds. Pulmonary auscultation: diminished vesicular murmur, with crackles up to midfields, expiratory wheezing and rhonchi. Abdomen: nondescript. Lower extremities: no oedema. Positive and symmetrical pulses at all levels.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on admission: sinus rhythm. Normal PR. rS from V1 to V3. ST ascended 4 mm V3-V4, 1-2 mm inferior and 1 mm in V5. ST underleveled in V6, I, aAVL. T sharp V3-V4. T +/- inferior. CBC: biochemistry: 170, urea 106, creatinine 1.50, sodium 132, potassium 4.5. Chlorine 95, GOT 27, LDH 1022, CK 156: Coagulation: normal. CBC: erythrocytes 3.64, haemoglobin 12, Ht 34.8, haemoglobin C.M 31.2. Platelets 363,000, MCV 10.3, lymphocytes 19.6. E 3,8. Maximal serial myocardial necrosis enzymes: TTUS > 10,000, CK/MB 5600/566. Chest X-ray: increased CTI. Signs of COPD. Prominent hilarity with redistribution. Urgent echocardiogram: Non-dilated LV. Mild LVH. Severely depressed LVEF (25-30 %). Akinesia of inferior, apical and septal segments. Hypokinesia of basal and anterior middle segments. Normal CCDD, with good function. Normal LA. Normal Ao root. No DP. Mild MI Urgent catheterisation (right radial): left coronary: thrombotic occlusion of the stent in the proximal LAD. Severe stenosis in distal edge of stent is observed after opening. Severe disease of bisector branch of borderline calibre. Severe stenosis of distal Cx in small calibre vessel. Right coronary: dominant. Thrombotic occlusion of the middle and distal DC stent. PCI with thrombectomy and balloon PTCA on mid and distal DC stent thrombosis, and on proximal and mid LAD stent thrombosis. PCI with direct stent implantation of a 2.75 mm diameter, 12 mm long XIENCE PRIME direct coated stent at 13 atmospheres in the middle LAD (distal edge of previous stent).  EVOLUTION The ECG showed anterior and inferior ST elevation, the echocardiogram showed akinesia of inferior, apical and septal segments with severely depressed systolic function (LVEF 30%). Urgent coronary angiography documented thrombotic occlusion of stents in the proximal LAD and also of stents in the mid and distal DC, thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty were performed on the proximal LAD and mid and distal DC, intracoronary abciximab was administered, achieving a good final angiographic result with TIMI III flow (Video 4). When restenosis of the distal edge of the middle LAD stent was found, it was decided to implant a DES (XIENCE PRIME®: 2.75x12 mm). The patient evolved favourably, a hypercoagulability study was performed, which was negative, and he was discharged in NYHA CF II, with treatment with aspirin (100 mg per day) and prasugrel (10 mg per day). After 4 months, he was readmitted for unstable angina, and a new coronary angiography was performed which showed severe restenosis of the proximal edge of the DES (Luc-Chopin®) from the first procedure in the proximal LAD (Video 5). After discussing the case in a medical-surgical session, surgical revascularisation was decided and a single coronary bypass of the internal mammary artery (IMA) to the LAD was performed, but the patient had a torpid postoperative period complicated by respiratory infection and finally died of refractory septic shock  DIAGNOSIS Extensive anterior + inferior STEMI, k II. Urgent catheterisation with late double thrombosis of stents at the level of the middle DC and proximal LAD. Thrombectomy, PTCA at mid and distal DC and proximal LAD. Implantation of everolimus-coated stent at the level of distal edge restenosis of mid LAD stent. Severe disease of distal CX and small-bore bisetrix. Severe restenosis of DES implanted in proximal LAD. Surgical revascularisation with IMA to LAD. Torpid postoperative course. Exitus. LVEF of 45%. HYPERTENSION. Diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2. DLP.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION An 86-year-old man came to the emergency department for dyspnoea.  History No drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: controlled arterial hypertension. Type 2 diabetes mellitus of five years of evolution in treatment with oral antidiabetics. Dyslipidaemia.  Previous cardiological history: chronic ischaemic heart disease which debuted in 2000 in the form of stable angina. Coronary angiography in 2005 for angina Class III/IV CCS and positive stress echocardiography for induction of ischaemia in the LAD territory. Three-vessel disease partially revascularised by drug-eluting stents to proximal LAD, middle DC and OM1. In 2008, again clinical angina II/IV CCS, with positive stress echocardiography for ischaemia in CX territory, opting for conservative management. Permanent non-valvular atrial fibrillation diagnosed in 2010, anticoagulated with acenocoumarol; echocardiography in that consultation ruled out significant valvulopathies and reported preserved LVEF. No studies or follow-up by Cardiology since then. Functional class II NYHA. Other pathologies: intermittent gait claudication in Fontaine stage IIa. Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Previous treatment: acenocoumarol, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24h, ranolazine 750 mg/12h, isosorbide mononitrate 50 mg/24h, rosuvastatin 10 mg/24h, metformin 1000 mg/12h, sitagliptin 50 mg/12h.

Current illness She attended the emergency department with progressive dyspnoea of one week's evolution accompanied by palpitations, unquantified weight gain, orthopnoea and episodes of DPN in the last few nights. The patient claimed adequate compliance with treatment and denied any dietary transgressions. The previous week he had felt a little more "cold", with cough, mucous expectoration and a feeling of dystrophy at home without thermometry. He consulted his health centre for this reason and was prescribed treatment with apyretics and mucolytics, with a partial response.  Physical examination BP: 105/45 mmHg, HR: 110 bpm, Ta 36.7°C, Sat O2 96 %. Weight 70 kg.

Extremities: pretibial oedema with fovea ++/+++; paedial pulses present but asymmetrical, no phlebitis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: glucose: 130 mg/dl, urea 58 mg/dl, creatinine 1.38 mg/dl, CrCl (Cockcroft-Gault): 38 ml/min/, sodium: 138 mEq/l, potassium: 5.2 mEq/l, NT-proBNP: 10.055pg/ml; TnT US: 89 ng/l (normal value < 15 ng/l); haemoglobin: 10 g/dl, haematocrit: 30.8 %; MCV: 87.5 fl, platelets: 277,000/uL; INR: 1.5. Emergency electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation at 120 bpm; narrow QRS with normal axis; early transition in V2 and LV overload pattern by ST-segment depression in V2-V5 and inferior leads. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, hilar congestion with vascular redistribution towards apexes, fluid in fissures and discrete pinching of the right costophrenic sinus. Transthoracic echocardiogram: marked biauricular dilatation. Severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction at the lower limit of normal (global LVEF by Simpson 52%). Thickened aortic valve with significant restriction to its opening and severe valvular stenosis by estimated area (area 0.65 cm2) although with low gradients (peak aortic transvalvular gradient 25 mmHg). Mitral filling pattern with single E wave by AF and increased filling pressures data: E/e" ratio 17 and shortened deceleration time (TD 115 ms). Mild mitral valve insufficiency. Myocardial deformation study with the following findings: Decreased GLS (-11 %) with preserved deformation parameters in apical segments and pathological in basal and middle segments (apical sparing). Bone scan with 99mTc-DPD: study with cardiac uptake of notable intensity, much higher than bone uptake, which in SPECT-CT is diffusely distributed and coincides with LV, these findings being suggestive of amyloidosis due to transthyretin deposition. In the rest of the study, discrete hyperuptake in the sternoclavicular joints and large bilateral joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips and knees) suggesting inflammatory/degenerative pathology.  EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward with a diagnosis of heart failure in the context of lower respiratory tract infection. He progressed well during the 72 hours following admission, achieving copious diuresis with treatment with intravenous furosemide and heart rate control with digoxin. After improvement of the congestive symptoms, a certain tendency to hypotension persisted, as well as bradycardia, despite a minimum dose of beta-blocker (bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 h), but without significant clinical repercussions except for slight dizziness with an orthostatic profile coinciding with sudden postural changes. Given the nature of the symptoms and the semiology, it was decided to update the echocardiographic study, with findings suggestive of infiltrative cardiomyopathy and severe aortic valve disease due to paradoxical low-flow stenosis previously unknown. In view of these results, it was decided to complete the study with immunofixation techniques aimed at ruling out the presence of a monoclonal component in blood and urine, a characteristic finding of the most frequent subtype of cardiac amyloidosis, secondary to light chain deposition (AL amyloidosis). After ruling out the presence of Bence Jones proteinuria or elevated plasma light chains, a bone scintigraphy study with 99mTc-DPD was requested, which showed intense left ventricular uptake, significantly higher than bone uptake, a finding highly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin deposition. Finally, the study was completed with a biopsy of abdominal fat in which the diagnosis of senile amyloidosis due to free transthyretin deposition was confirmed. After reaching a consensus with the patient on a conservative approach to the management of his aortic valve disease and given the clinical stability achieved, he was discharged home after pharmacological adjustment for outpatient clinical follow-up in cardiology consultations.  DIAGNOSIS Decompensated heart failure in the context of lower respiratory tract infection. Preserved LVEF. Senile cardiac amyloidosis due to abnormal transthyretin deposition. Paradoxical" severe low-flow aortic valve stenosis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 45-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes. In 2007 she was diagnosed with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, initially with normal ventricular function, although since 2012 she had severe left ventricular dysfunction and moderate right ventricular dysfunction. He had also undergone ablation of three accessory pathways due to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in 2012 required pacemaker implantation due to high-grade AV block. Other antecedents include cochlear implantation in the right ear in 2004 for sensorineural deafness. Baseline: independent for activities of daily living, in NYHA functional class III, without angina. Usual treatment: bisoprolol 1.25 mg, eplerenone 25 mg, sitagliptin 25 mg, paracetamol on demand. Admitted to our hospital in January 2016 due to worsening functional class, presenting dyspnoea at rest and bendopnoea, without orthopnoea or DPN.  Examination revealed BP 80/50 mmHg, HR 77 bpm, O2 saturation 96% on room air, with no evidence of congestion on pulmonary auscultation, and no oedema in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: Hb 13.9 g/dl; leukocytes 8,240/ul; platelets 147,000/ul; urea 89 mg/dl; creatinine 0.96 mg/dl; Na 143 mEq/l; K 4.0 mEq/l; glucose 76 mg/dl, HbA1c 7.1 %. Total cholesterol 138 mg/dl; HDL 30 mg/dl; LDL 93 mg/dl; TG 75 mg/dl. INR 1.3. NT-proBNP 6,903 ng/dl. Normal liver and iron profile. Chest X-ray: bicameral pacemaker. Cardiomegaly. Free costophrenic sinuses, with no signs of pulmonary congestion. ECG: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm with pacemaker-mediated ventricular pacing. Echocardiogram: non-dilated LV, with severe asymmetric hypertrophy, with no evidence of dynamic obstruction at the outflow tract level. Severely depressed global systolic function (LVEF by Simpson biplane: 21%). Pseudonormal filling pattern. Hypertrophic RV with moderate systolic dysfunction (shortening fraction: 29%). Mild MI. Mild AoI. Mild TR, allowing estimation of a PSAP of 32 mmHg. No pericardial effusion.  EVOLUTION During admission, diuretic treatment was adjusted and the patient was discharged from hospital after 7 days. The patient was asked about her family history and it was noted that three of her seven sisters were diabetic and had a cochlear implant. Therefore, this is a patient with hearing loss and diabetes (both at an early age and with a family history) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A genetic study was requested, which subsequently confirmed the existence of the 3243A>G mutation, establishing the diagnosis of MELAS syndrome (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Mitochondrial Syndrome) Encephalomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes). Two months later, the patient showed subjective clinical improvement, started a cardiac rehabilitation programme and continued with a tendency to arterial hypotension.  Four months after hospital discharge, the patient was upgraded to a three-chamber ICD-CRT without complications. Better tolerance to physical activity since starting cardiac rehabilitation, but is in NYHA functional class II-III. She was assessed by Neurology, who considered that the neurological involvement did not seem to be significant, and that cases of stroke were more frequent at younger ages and in males affected by the disease, so the neurological prognosis did not seem to be limiting in this patient. In accordance with the poor functional class and the progressive nature of the cardiac involvement, as well as the scarce significant associated comorbidity, referral was made to another hospital for evaluation of cardiac transplantation. Virus serology, respiratory function tests and abdominal ultrasound were performed, with normal results. However, the patient was not placed on the transplant waiting list due to severe depressive disorder.  DIAGNOSIS MELAS syndrome: Non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in dilated phase. Biventricular involvement with severe LV systolic dysfunction and moderate RV systolic dysfunction. Heart failure in NYHA functional class II-III. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with ablation of 3 accessory pathways. High degree AV block, carrier of a bicameral pacemaker with upgrade to ICD-CRT. Sensorineural deafness, cochlear implant carrier. Type 2 diabetes mellitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 53-year-old woman, diagnosed with mild dyslipidaemia for the last 5 years on dietary treatment. No other known risk factors or toxic habits. No medication at home. In the previous 48 hours she presented with episodes of self-limiting central thoracic pain, without seeking medical assistance. At around 10 am, while having breakfast, she suffered a new episode of typical central thoracic pain accompanied by vegetative cortex, for which she went to the emergency department accompanied by her family (11:20 am). After syncopal symptoms in the triage area, she was transferred to observation, and VT was observed at 220 bpm. Basic CPR manoeuvres were started (5 min duration), followed by CVE at 200 J, with an asystole rhythm. 2 mg of atropine is administered. Advanced CPR for 5 min, achieving pulse (total CPR 10 min) and sinus rhythm at 85 bpm with significant ST elevation in anterior leads. Amiodarone infusion (1,200 mg) was started and the patient was transferred to the haemodynamics ward for urgent catheterisation. During the transfer, an episode of NSVT at 200 bpm was recorded, followed by sinus rhythm and complete AVB after 10-15 min. Advanced CPR was performed again for 30 minutes with orotracheal intubation and adrenaline perfusion was started. In the haemodynamics room, a transient pacemaker was implanted via the right femoral artery and cardiac catheterisation was performed via femoral access, which revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease and complete revascularisation was performed. In addition, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed with 1:1 assistance. During catheterisation, a nasogastric tube is inserted and 300 mg of ASA and 180 mg of ticagrelor are administered. A bolus of abciximab is administered and the intravenous infusion is continued. A few minutes later, she started bleeding in the oral cavity and through the endotracheal tube, and abciximab was discontinued. At the end of the catheterisation, the adrenaline infusion was withdrawn. She arrived at the ICU without vasoactive drugs, connected to mechanical ventilation. She suffered another cardiorespiratory arrest, her third, this time in asystole. She was resuscitated for 15 minutes (2 mg of adrenaline), leaving in sinus rhythm. Examination on admission to the ICU revealed BP 100/80 mmHg, HR 100 bpm, RR 18 rpm. Neurological examination: bilateral mydriasis, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. Pulmonary auscultation with bibasal crackles. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic, no murmurs, counterpulsation noises. Extremities with peripheral coldness, weak distal pulses, no signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG after 1st CRP: RS at 85 bpm, PR 200 ms, QRS 120 ms, significant ST-segment elevation in anterior leads V1 to V4. Urgent cardiac catheterisation: 3-vessel coronary artery disease. Lesions in DA (proximal occlusion), CX (OM with 90% stenosis) and CD (mid-level occlusion). Complete revascularisation with 2 stents in LAD, 1 in OM and 1 in DC. Chest X-ray on admission: non-selective orotracheal intubation. Bilateral alveolointerstitial pattern. Echocardiogram in ICU: left ventricle not dilated, not hypertrophic, with moderately depressed systolic function (EF 35-40 %), with septal akinesia, anterior and apical segments. Better contractility in basal and medial lateral and basal and medial anterior. Right ventricle not dilated, with normal systolic function by TAPSE. Left atrium not dilated. Normal aortic root. Inferior vena cava not dilated, collapsing on inspiration. Laboratory tests on admission: haemoglobin 14.8 mg/dl, leucocytes 11,250/ul, platelets 376,000/ul. Glucose 130 mg/dl, creatinine 1.7 mg/dl, Na 139 mEq/l, K 4.6 mEq/l, GOT 571 IU/l, LDH 1,854 IU/l, peak CK 3,254 IU/l, troponinT US: 20,641 ng/ml, CRP 73.3 mg/l. Cardiology laboratory tests: haemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, leucocytes 14.460/ul, platelets 631,000/ul, glycaemia 118 mg/dl, urea 58 mg/dl, creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, triglycerides 385 mg/dl, total cholesterol 199 mg/dl (LDL 145 mg/dl, HDL 30 mg/dl), GOT 74 IU/l, GPT 172 IU/l, GGT 501 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 243 IU/l, LDH 502 IU/l. Thyroid function: free T4 1.73 mg/dl, TSH 14.43 IUI/ml. ProBNP 2,663 pg/ml.  EVOLUTION During the first 8 hours in the ICU, he remained in cardiogenic shock and low cardiac output, with cardiac index of 1.5 L/min/m2, need for vasoactive drugs at very high doses (dobutamine and noradrenaline) and signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, with lactate up to 16 mmol/l, oliguric renal dysfunction and pulmonary oedema with severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and FiO2 of 100%. It was decided to place cardiorespiratory support in the form of venoarterial ECMO, which was performed in the operating theatre by Cardiac Surgery after 8 hours of stay in the ICU. After ECMO placement, haemodynamic improvement was observed with withdrawal of vasoactive agents after 24 hours. Assistance was started with 4 l/min, which was progressively reduced until weaning was achieved on the fourth day after placement. In the following days haemodynamic stability was maintained with a cardiac index of 3 l/min/m2 under treatment with levosimendan and dobutamine. Echocardiography showed moderate ventricular dysfunction with an estimated LVEF of 35-40%. Initially, the patient presented mild delirium and tetraparesis, which recovered quickly, waking up clearly, without neurological focality. Given his stability and improvement, it was decided to transfer him to the Cardiology ward for further care and treatment. Favourable evolution on the cardiology ward, tolerating treatment with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and amiodarone until she became asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view. She presented significant elevation of transaminases, myalgias and general malaise that resolved after discontinuation of statin treatment. Atorvastatin 80-40 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg were tried. Hypercholesterolaemia persists with total cholesterol 257 mg/dl, LDL 151 mg/dl, HDL 34 mg/dl and triglycerides 580 mg/dl despite treatment with ezetimibe 10 mg and fibrates. It was decided to start treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab 140 mg every 15 days) and she was included in a cardiac rehabilitation programme. She started with very low capacity, which gradually increased, with very good progress. She completed a total of 60 treadmill sessions and completed the cardiac rehabilitation programme without complications. Improvement in functional class for dyspnoea, Borg scale 3-4. Training HR: 85-100 bpm. No clinical signs of angina with the effort achieved. Adequate LDL control is achieved with figures of 31 mg/dl.  DIAGNOSIS Resuscitated cardiorespiratory arrest. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, Killip IV. 3-vessel coronary artery disease, urgent complete revascularisation. Moderate-severe LV systolic dysfunction. Transient ECMO support. Hypercholesterolemia with intolerance to statins. Good LDL control with anti-PCSK9. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We are dealing with a 70-year-old patient with no known drug allergies or toxic habits; no known diabetes mellitus but hypertensive and dyslipidaemic. He has a family history of ischaemic heart disease. The patient's cardiological history began in July 2012, when Holter monitoring was requested after presenting symptomatic bradycardia that required chronotropic drugs during arthroscopy. The 24-hour recording showed spells of atrial fibrillation with MVF 100 bpm (max 150) alternating with the patient's baseline rhythm which was sinus bradycardia (45 bpm). An echocardiographic study was completed, with no abnormalities. In November 2012, a bicameral pacemaker was implanted via the subclavian artery and anticoagulation with acenocoumarol was started. Due to persistent atrial fibrillation with poor clinical control, electrical cardioversion was performed and she was discharged with amiodarone 200 mg/24 h and bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 h, in addition to anticoagulation. In January 2014, he was referred to the outpatient cardiology department for dyspnoea and chest tightness related to exertion of 2 months' duration. An echocardiogram was performed showing LV with moderately depressed EF. Depletive treatment was started (furosemide and eplerenone) and an analytical study and coronary angiography were requested. Coronary angiography showed stenosis of the proximal anterior descending artery (DAp) 80%, circumflex at the level of the exit of the first obtuse marginal (Cx- OM1) 100% and proximal right coronary (CDp) 90%, and middle (CDm) 60%, opting for surgical revascularisation. The intervention was performed in September 2014, with triple coronary puncture to the middle LAD with internal mammary artery (IMA) and sequence with saphenous vein (SVF) to 1st OM and posterolateral branches. Postoperative evolution was torpid with multiple admissions for dyspnoea and cardiac decompensation. SPECT was performed and showed mild lateral ischaemia, so a new coronary angiography was requested, showing patency of all bypasses performed. The MCP was reviewed, revealing MCP dysfunction, which was corrected by modifying the programming. Since then, asymptomatic in functional class II. Treatment with amiodarone was withdrawn and replaced with dronedarone due to hypothyroidism. He repeatedly consulted for muscle pain related to statins (simvastatin 10 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg), for which he was referred to the Lipidology unit of reference, despite which the myalgias always recurred with the reintroduction of statins. Finally, given the high cardiovascular risk, intolerance to lipid-lowering drugs and severe dyslipidaemia, treatment with IPCSK9 was started with good tolerance and LDL levels were reduced to 88 mg/dl from an initial level of 218 mg/dl.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests 12-07-16 (patient's baseline): creatinine 0.98 mg/dl, urea 38.8 mg/dl, total cholesterol 289 mg/dl, HDL 44 mg/dl, LDL 218 mg/dl, TG 240 mg/dl, AST 22U/l, ALT 23 U/l, GGT 52 U/l, FA 72 U/l, sodium 143 mEq/l, potassium 4.3 mEq/l, TSH 2.27 IUI/ml, T4L 1.14 ng/dl. Hb 16.4 g/dl, Ht 50.5%, leukocytes 7.11 x 10^9/L, platelets 164x10^9/L. Blood tests 15-11-16 (after 3 months with IPCSK9): creatinine 0.93mg/dl, urea 49.6 mg/dl, total cholesterol 201.6 mg/dl, HDL 44 mg/dl, LDL 109.6mg/dl, AST 26U/l, ALT 24 U/l, GGT 56 U/l, FA 77 U/l, sodium 143 mEq/l, potassium 4.5 mEq/l, TSH 2.47 IUI/ml, T4L 1.3 ng/dl. Hb 17 g/dl, Hto 52.6%, leukocytes 6.24 x 10^9/l, platelets 172x10^9/l. After this analytical result, he decided to increase the dose of IPCSK9 from 75 mg to 150 mg fortnightly. Blood tests 06-04-17 (control 6 months after starting treatment): creatinine 0.76 mg/dl, urea 53.6 mg/dl, total cholesterol 162 mg/dl, HDL 45 mg/dl, LDL 88.40 mg/dl, TG 143 mg/dl, AST 24U/l, ALT 25 U/l, GGT 44 U/l, FA 77 U/l, sodium 143 mEq/l, potassium 5.1 mEq/l, TSH 2.59 IUI/ml, T4L 1.28 ng/dl. Hb 17.3 g/dl, Ht 53.5%, leukocytes 6.11x 10^9/L, platelets 142x10^9/L.  EVOLUTION The patient is currently in stable class of his cardiopathy. With functional class II, asymptomatic for chest pain and tolerating medication without incident. The last echocardiogram showed recovery of the ejection fraction, which was classified as preserved in the last echocardiogram. Due to back pain that had been present for months, an abdominal CT scan was performed, which revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm, pending surgery for the placement of an endoprosthesis. This is therefore a patient at very high cardiovascular risk due to ischaemic heart disease, aortic vascular disease and dyslipidaemia in whom treatment with statins was not possible due to intolerance, in whom the introduction of IPCSK9 has managed to reduce his LDL-c levels by more than 50%, and he is increasingly close to reaching the desired level for his high cardiovascular risk, which is less than 70 mg/dL.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic ischaemic heart disease with 3-vessel disease. History of triple aorto-coronary bypass with IMA to LAD and SFN sequence to MO1 and PD. Transient left ventricular dysfunction (currently normal LVEF). Abdominal aortic aneurysm pending endovascular repair. Stable heart failure in functional class II. Sinus dysfunction with paroxysmal AF. Carrier of normofunctioning DDD MCP at the present time. Severe dyslipidaemia. Intolerance to statins. Treatment with IPCSK9 with good evolution. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 50-year-old man came to the emergency department for chest pain. No known allergies. No toxic habits. No habitual treatment. No CVRF. Only previous history of tonsillectomy in childhood and left meniscectomy. Asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view, until the early morning of admission (4:00 a.m.). He started with shooting pains in the jaw. Subsequently, they radiate to the anterior region of the thorax, become oppressive, of moderate intensity, without vegetative cortex. They subside spontaneously one hour later. She had several recurrences, of greater intensity, and so she went to the emergency department. Arrives more than 6 hours after the onset of the symptoms, with slight residual discomfort. She improved after conventional analgesia. On arrival she was haemodynamically stable. BP 119/83 mmHg; HR 68 bpm; SatO2 98 % on room air; Ta 36.1°C. Glasgow Scale: 15/15. Conscious, oriented in all 3 spheres. Eupneic at rest, well hydrated, nourished and perfused. AC: rhythmic without murmurs or extratonos. PA: vesicular murmur preserved in both lung fields with no extra sounds. Abdomen: hydro-aerial sounds present, soft, not painful on deep or superficial palpation. Renal fist percussion (-). Extremities: no oedema, no signs of DVT. Basic neurological examination was normal.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 68 bpm. Poor R wave growth in precordial leads, isolated Q wave in lead III, with no other alterations. No evolutionary changes in subsequent electrocardiograms. Portable echocardiogram (Vscan in the ER): LV not dilated or hypertrophic, with normal global and segmental systolic function. Normal aortic root. RV not dilated. No significant valvulopathies. No pleural effusion. Haemogram: leucocytes 5,200/uL; neutrophils 61.3 %; lymphocytes 27.2 %; Hb 15.5 gr/dl; Htc 43.4 %; MCV 87.1 fl; platelets 180,000/uL. Haemostasis: APTT 29.3 sec; INR 1. Biochemistry: glucose 112 mg/dl, creatinine 1.07 mg/dl, sodium 141 mmol/l, potassium 4 mmol/l, total protein 6.3g/dl, albumin 3.7g/dl, calcium 8.6mg/dl, phosphorus 3.4 mg/dl, uric acid 7.6 mg/dl, triglycerides 141 mg/dl, cholesterol 163 mg/dl, GOT 114 U/l, GPT 119 U/l, GGT 95 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 63 U/l, LDH 496 U/l, total bilirubin 1.91 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 0.52 mg/dl. Enzyme serology: 1a: CK 766 U/l, troponin I 25.89 ng/ml (normal < 0.06 ). 2a: CK 727 U/I troponin I 36.13 ng/ml. 3a: CK 696 U/I, troponin I 27.52 ng/ml. Chest X-ray: no signs of CHF or parenchymal infiltrates. Serology: IgM HAV: negative; IgG anti HBc: negative; Anti HCV: negative; IgM anti CMV: negative; IgM against VCA: negative; Anti HIV: negative; Toxoplasmosis IgG IgM: negative. MRSA culture: negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Image 2): LV with preserved systolic function. Late gadolinium enhancement in basal and medial, anterior, lateral and inferior segments of the left ventricle, respecting only the interventricular septum and apex. The enhancement shows subepicardial distribution without transmural involvement, being compatible with myocarditis. Coronary angiography: LCT, LAD and DC within normality. Mild stenosis of 20-30% in the middle CX. LVEF preserved in ventriculography. No images suggestive of coronary anomalies, dissection or thrombosis.  EVOLUTION Given the clinical manifestations of chest pain and enzyme elevation, the initial diagnosis of NSTEACS was established. He was admitted to the ICU and treatment was started with double antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation, statins and beta-blockers. He remained haemodynamically stable, asymptomatic, with no heart rhythm disturbances or evidence of CHF. Serialisation of markers of myocardial damage showed a clear increase, in addition to continuing with mild chest pain. Coronary angiography was performed and no coronary pathology was found to justify the clinical picture. Laboratory tests showed an increase in transaminases and bilirubin with no clinical alterations on examination at the digestive level, so a viral serology study was requested. In view of the coronary angiography findings, the patient was questioned again and reported that in the last 2 months he had presented catarrhal symptoms and pharyngitis with clinical symptoms the week prior to admission of general malaise, myalgia and dysthermic sensation with fever of up to 37.4°C, with good response to paracetamol. In the presence of coronary arteries without significant lesions, chest pain after respiratory infection and elevated markers of myocardial damage, myocarditis was suspected. Treatment for NSTEACS was suspended. The patient remained stable on the ward, with no recurrence of chest pain, heart failure or arrhythmias. An echocardiographic study prior to discharge showed preserved LVEF with no alterations in global or segmental contractility. No evolutionary ECG changes during admission. Clinical evolution was favourable, with treatment with ACE inhibitors. MRI was requested 48 hours later, which confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocarditis of probable viral aetiology. Preserved LVEF. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 65-year-old male type 2 diabetic of 8 years of evolution (on metformin treatment) who was admitted to our centre (on treatment with metformin) who was admitted to our centre for congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient had been a smoker until March 2014, with a pack-year index of 30. In addition, he was overweight (fulfilling metabolic syndrome criteria), hypertensive and hypercholesterolaemic (both under medical treatment with enalapril 5 mg/12 h, bisoprolol 5 mg/24 h and atorvastatin 40 mg/24 h). His past history of interest included an inferior myocardial infarction in 1997, with no information on interventionism and no subsequent follow-up, as well as permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol. In 2014 he developed ischaemic colitis and a Forrest III gastric ulcer requiring hospital admission. This was complicated by a new non-ST-elevation type II infarction in the context of rectal bleeding. Once the patient was stabilised, coronary angiography revealed severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease: proximal anterior descending (LAD) occlusion, severe proximal circumflex and first obtuse marginal (OM1) lesion, severe proximal bisector lesion and right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (LVEF 25%). For all these reasons, it was decided in a medical-surgical session to perform coronary revascularisation surgery, which was finally carried out with the implantation of four vascular grafts (mammary artery to distal LAD, saphenous vein in "Y" to bisector and OM1 and saphenous vein to mid-distal DC). Subsequent evolution was satisfactory, but in 2015 the patient began to present symptoms of CHF, requiring a first hospital admission in relation to dietary transgression. Since then, he had been on treatment with 60 mg of furosemide daily and 25 mg of spironolactone, in functional class (FC) II/IV ambulatory. She was admitted to our centre in October 2016 due to decompensation of severe CHF with acute hypertensive pulmonary oedema, requiring management in the acute unit with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and intravenous medication. He also initially required inotropic support with dobutamine, which was successfully withdrawn via a course of levosimendan. The electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 90 bpm, with QRS of 100ms, QS in V1-V3 and flattened T in V5-6, similar to previous records. As part of the diagnostic study, a new coronary angiography was performed, which showed patency of the previous grafts, as well as a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which showed an LVEF of 24%, together with a transmural late enhancement pattern in the LAD territory. In addition, the patient had moderate right ventricular systolic dysfunction. The hospital evolution was again favourable, and after discussion with the Heart Team, it was decided to implant a subcutaneous single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). After optimisation of pharmacological treatment (enalapril 10 mg/12 h; bisoprolol 5 mg/24 h; furosemide 80 mg/24 h; spironolactone 25 mg/24 h), a lipid profile control was performed, showing LDL-cholesterol levels of 65 mg/dl and total cholesterol of 160mg/dl. Likewise, the glycosylated haemoglobin value was 7.9%, outside the therapeutic target, so it was decided, together with the Endocrinology Department, to optimise treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs. As the patient was at high cardiovascular risk, with several decompensations due to CHF, regular blood pressure control and metabolic syndrome, it was decided to add empaglifozin 10 mg daily to the previous treatment with metformin. The patient was discharged from hospital and continued to be closely monitored in the Cardiology day hospital.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Posteroanterior and lateral chest X-ray: global cardiomegaly, increased bronchovascular tract compatible with interstitial and alveolar oedema, cisural effusion, sternotomy suture. Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 90 bpm, with QRS of 100 ms, QS in V1-V3 and flattened T in V5-6. Transthoracic echocardiogram: moderately dilated left ventricle, with normal wall thickness. Severely depressed global systolic function (LVEF 20% by visual estimation). Akinesia and thinning of the septum, apical (segment 17 aneurysm) and inferior face and mid and distal segments of the lateral-inferior. Single wave mitral filling. Left atrium slightly dilated. Mildly dilated right atrium. Right ventricle severely dilated, with global systolic function at the lower limit of normal. TAPSE of 14 mm. Mitral valve with calcium ring, thickening of the leaflets and restriction of the posterior leaflet opening. Mild insufficiency. Sclerosed aortic valve, without pathological transaortic gradients. Mild insufficiency. Morphologically normal tricuspid valve. Moderate insufficiency. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 65 mmHg. Dilated inferior vena cava (24.54 mm), without inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. Epicardial fat. Aortic root 30 mm. Ascending aorta 37 mm. Pre-surgical coronary angiography: right dominance. Truncus: no lesions. Anterior descending: chronic occlusion at proximal level, observed by heterocoronary circulation, being a vessel of good calibre and development. Circumflex: artery of good development and calibre. It presents a severe lesion at the proximal level (85-90%), just after the exit of OM1, the rest of the vessel is of good calibre and development. OM1 is a vessel of good development and calibre, with a significant calcified lesion at the proximal level, the rest of the vessel is of good calibre and development. Bisector branch: vessel of good calibre and development, with severe calcified disease at the proximal level, the rest of the vessel with diffuse mild atheromatosis. Right coronary description: right dominant. Chronic occlusion at the middle level, distal vessel is observed by heterocoronary circulation being a vessel of good development. Diagnostic findings: severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease (chronic occlusion of DA and CD), severe Cx lesion (proximal Cx, OM1 and bisector branch). Cardiac MRI: severely dilated left ventricle (VTD 295 ml, VTS 225 ml), with normal wall thickness. Severely depressed global systolic function (LVEF 24%). Akinesia and thinning of the septum and anterior face and distal third of all faces. Inferior face akinesia. Late enhancement is observed transmurally affecting the apex and distal third of inferior, lateral, anterior and septum, 75 % subendocardial in mid and distal segment of anterior face and septum, and 50 % in the basal segment of anterior face and septum. 75 % enhancement in lower basal segment. Moderately dilated left atrium (apical plane area 43 cm2). Right atrium slightly dilated (32 cm2). Right ventricle not dilated (VTD 111 ml, VTS 77 ml), with moderately depressed global systolic function with global hypokinesia. RVEF 31%. Conclusion: dilated cardiomyopathy of ischaemic aetiology with severely depressed global systolic function and late enhancement pattern of ischaemic aetiology with multivessel involvement. Absence of viability in the territory of the anterior descending artery. Moderate right ventricular systolic dysfunction.  EVOLUTION Three months after hospital discharge, the patient has a glycosylated haemoglobin of 7.3%, has lost 3 kg in weight, maintains good blood pressure control with current figures around 120/70 mmHg and has not been admitted again for CHF, remaining in ambulatory functional class II and having allowed a decrease in diuretic treatment to 60 mg of furosemide. He has not been discharged from the ICD either. As this is a young patient at high cardiovascular risk, it was decided to titrate empaglifozin to 25 mg to improve glycaemic control. At the next outpatient review, four months after the previous one, the glycosylated haemoglobin value was 6.8%, the patient had continued to lose weight, with good control of the rest of the CVRF, no hospital admissions, no ICD discharges and in functional class II.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic heart failure with LVEF 24% and RVEF 31% by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Chronic ischaemic heart disease with 3-vessel coronary artery disease revascularised by quadruple bypass. Chronic inferior and anterior infarction. Absence of viability in the territory of the anterior descending artery. Carrier of Biotronik single-chamber ICD in primary prevention. Permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with sintrom. Diabetes mellitus in treatment with metformin and empaglifozin. Arterial hypertension. Dyslipidaemia. Exobtachism. Metabolic syndrome. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of a 36-year-old male, hypertensive, with abnormally high plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and glycated haemoglobin, who presents with ischaemic heart disease.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history Hypertensive for more than 5 years on treatment with enalapril (he had stopped treatment). Ex-smoker. Hypertriglyceridaemia. Undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. No known previous heart disease or other medical illnesses of interest.  Family history: father with AMI at the age of 50. Young hypertensive mother. Grandmother and maternal aunt with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension.  Previous treatment: omeprazole 20 mg, 1/day, enalapril 20 mg, 1/day.  Present illness A 36-year-old male patient came to the emergency department for a week with a clinical presentation of central thoracic pain that he described as oppressive, non-radiating and without vegetative cortex, which did not increase with pressure. He reports that it starts in the morning and that after an hour of pain it usually subsides, without palpitations. In the last two days she noticed that the pain appeared with exertion and decreased with rest. She went to her health centre for the same reason, where they observed supraventricular tachycardia and a tendency to hypertension (she has stopped taking the treatment), which was treated with antihypertensives and benzodiazepines without improvement.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 56-year-old male, with no known drug allergies, with a history of arterial hypertension being treated with two drugs and dyslipidaemia; with no personal or family history of heart disease, heart failure or sudden death. Three days ago she reported an episode of oppressive chest pain radiating to the jaw, left upper limb and back, after intense exertion (carrying a weight), of several hours' duration, accompanied by vegetatism. She did not consult for this episode. On the day she sought medical attention, she presented a new episode of chest pain similar to the previous one, while making intense effort, and so she called the Emergency Medical Service. On initial assessment: BP 123/99 mmHg, HR 105 bpm and SatO2 100% with nasal goggles at 2 L/min. Initial physical examination revealed a pansystolic murmur in the mesocardium. An electrocardiogram was performed with pain, showing sinus rhythm, AV block Mobitz I. Narrow QRS. Pathological Q waves in inferior face and inferior ST elevation with DIII>DII maximum of 4 mm in DII and specular decrease in DI and aVL of up to 5 mm. ST elevation V3-V6 with negative anterior T waves. The AMI code was activated and the patient was transferred to our centre. Acetylsalicylic acid 250 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, enoxaparin 30 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg were administered. During the transfer, hypotension with BP 73/42 mmHg. He was transferred to the haemodynamics ward for urgent coronary angiography. During the procedure, dobutamine and noradrenaline were started, requiring dose increases up to 20 mcg/kg/min and 20 ml/h respectively. Coronary angiography revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease: Two severe lesions (90 %) in tandem in the anterior descending (AD) at the level of the middle third (pre- and post-exit of the second diagonal) with involvement of the ostial-proximal segment of the second diagonal (80 %); first marginal occlusion at the middle level (100 %) with no distal bed visualisation and proximal occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) (100 %). PCI was performed to the proximal-medial DC with implantation of a 3 x 36 mm non-drug-eluting stent at 20 atm, with good results. Urgent transthoracic cardiac ultrasound was performed during the procedure, which showed an anfractuous ventricular septal defect (VSD) located in the basal septum, about 30 mm in diameter, with a hypocontractile RV; therefore, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) was implanted. After the procedure, he was admitted to the Coronary Unit for stabilisation. The case was discussed with the Coronary Unit of our reference centre and he was transferred for surgery. Physical examination: conscious and oriented in all three spheres. Signs of poor distal perfusion. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart tones, pansystolic murmur in mesocardium III/VI not radiated. Jugular ingurgitation +++. Respiratory auscultation: physiological vesicular murmur without added pathological sounds. No declining oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: RS, BAV Mobitz I, narrow QRS, inferior Q waves and inferior ST elevation with III > II of maximum 4 mm in III and specular decrease in I and aVL of up to 5 mm; also ST elevation in V3-V6 with negative anterior T wave. CBC: glucose 290 mg/dl, urea 65 mg/dl, creatinine 2.05 mg/dl, CK 1199 U/L, troponin I 37.73 ng/ml, sodium 136 mmol/l, potassium 4.62 mmol/l. Leukocytes 13430, haemoglobin 14.2 g/dl, haematocrit 41.5%, platelets 95,000. Emergent coronary angiography: right dominant coronary arteries: significant stenosis. Truncus description: good calibre, no significant lesions. Description of the anterior descending artery: vessel of good calibre and extension. Two severe tandem lesions at the level of the middle third (pre- and post-exit of the second diagonal) with involvement of the ostial-proximal segment of the second diagonal. Rest of the vessel with non-significant diffuse irregularities. Good distal bed, TIMI 3 flow. Circumflex description: occluded at the level of the first middle marginal with no distal bed visible. Intermediate branch developed, no lesions. Right coronary description: occluded proximally. Procedure: cannulation of the DC ostium with AR2 catheter, passing a guide wire distally from the posterior descending artery. Thrombus extract is passed, which is productive and TIMI 2 flow appears, and a 3 x 36 mm non-drug-eluting stent is implanted at 20 atm, with good results. Conclusions: right dominance. Three-vessel disease. PCI to proximal-medial DC. Wide VSD Transthoracic cardiac ultrasound: ventricular septal defect with an anfractuous course located in the basal septum, about 30 mm in diameter, RV hypocontractile. Transthoracic cardiac echocardiography prior to hospital discharge: non-hypertrophic left ventricle, slightly dilated, with severely depressed systolic function (EF 27%) due to extensive septal and inferoposterior akinesia, patch at the level of the interventricular septum, with no flow between the two ventricles; mild aortic insufficiency and moderate-severe functional mitral insufficiency. Right ventricle slightly dilated. Depressed right ventricular dynamics (TAPSE 11). Mild tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating normal PAPs.  EVOLUTION On arrival at the reference centre, in a situation of cardiogenic shock refractory to pharmacological treatment and IABP due to large post-infarction VSD; urgent transthoracic cardiac ultrasound was performed which showed a globally normal contractile left ventricle, midbasal inferoposterior akinesia, dilated right ventricle, slightly hypocontractile; and a wide ventricular septal defect of up to 4 cm in anteroposterior diameter and 3 cm in apicobasal diameter. An ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) peripheral venous-arterial system was implanted as a bridge to corrective surgery for VSD. Subsequently, there was a tendency towards stability, allowing a progressive decrease in vasoactive amine support with adequate ECMO functioning. On the fourth day of admission, VSD closure of the basal and middle posterior septum was performed with a bovine pericardial patch and bypass of the internal mammary artery to the anterior descending artery. Echocardiogram was performed after surgery, decreasing support with ECMO, in which stable left ventricular function, hyperdynamic segments with preserved mobility. Non-dilated right ventricle, with severe dysfunction. Eccentric tricuspid insufficiency directed to the low interatrial septum. No ventricular septal defect. It was decided to continue ECMO support and treatment was associated with levosimendan. The patient continued to evolve well, decreasing ECMO litres and tolerating IABP 1:4. In view of the favourable evolution, it was decided to withdraw ECMO with 1:1 IABP support and dobutamine at 8 mcg/kg/min. Subsequent good evolution, allowing withdrawal of IABC and inotropes, and introduction of oral treatment with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists. Complications during admission included: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, prolonged respiratory weaning, requiring percutaneous tracheostomy for prolonged orotracheal intubation; due to respiratory failure secondary to alveolar haemorrhage and acute respiratory distress syndrome; nosocomial pneumonia in the right lower lobe (Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter koseri) and urinary tract infection by multidrug-resistant Serratia marcescens. The patient progressed favourably, tolerating neurohormonal treatment, with negative water balance and low-dose diuretics. A control ultrasound was performed prior to hospital discharge, showing a slightly dilated left ventricle, with severely depressed systolic function (EF 27%) due to extensive septal and inferoposterior akinesia; patch at the level of the interventricular septum, with no flow between the two ventricles; mild aortic insufficiency and moderate-severe functional mitral insufficiency. Slightly dilated right ventricle. Right ventricular dysfunction.  DIAGNOSIS Acute myocardial infarction with inferior ST elevation Killip Kimball IV. Proximal DC thrombotic occlusion. PPCI to proximal-medial DC. 3-vessel coronary artery disease (middle DA, 1st OM and CD) wide septal septal septal defect. Closure with bovine pericardial patch. Internal mammary artery bypass to LAD. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy with severe LV systolic dysfunction. Moderate-severe functional mitral insufficiency. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION He has a history of arterial hypertension, type II diabetes without target organ involvement and dyslipidaemia. Cardiologically, he had ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with very severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 8%), secondary to coronary artery disease of the trunk and 3 vessels revascularised percutaneously on several occasions with severe diffuse distal disease. A cavo-tricuspid isthmus ablation was performed for common flutter in 2008, presenting permanent atrial fibrillation since February 2014. Valvularly, he had moderate aortic stenosis with a maximum gradient of 36 mmHg and an average gradient of 18 mmHg, and an area per continuity equation of 1.2 cm2. He has an ICD in primary prevention. He presented hyperthyroidism due to type 2 thyroiditis induced by amiodarone. Since device implantation, he has had no thrombotic or embolic complications, with stable flow parameters and pulsatility indices. Subsequent reviews showed a tendency to hypertension, with deterioration of renal function up to 2 mg/dl after increasing hypotensive drugs, in relation to previous renal disease. During a routine check-up at the Cardiology day hospital, the patient reported worsening dyspnoea until it became moderate exertion over 15 days of evolution, accompanied by chest pain related to inspiratory movements in the left hemithorax. Physical examination showed a mean blood pressure of 100 mmHg measured with the aid of a portable vascular Doppler. Weight was stable with respect to previous examinations, with normal O2 saturation (95 %). Of note was the presence of jugular venous ingurgitation of 7cm with positive hepatojugular reflux. Cardiac auscultation showed continuous flow noise of ventricular assistance and minimal systolic murmur, barely audible, with pulmonary auscultation with hypoventilation in the left hemithorax. There was no hepatomegaly, but there was bimalleolar oedema in the lower limbs. The driveline outlet was explored and found to be in perfect condition, without suppuration or erythema. The Heart Mate II daily chart shows speeds of 9,200 rpm, flow rate 4.7-5.2 litres, pulsatility index 6.9-7.3 and power 5-5.6W. Multiple PI events in relation to suction episodes detected by the machine (previously only occasional).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response, with controlled RV. Lower QS. Wide QRS (140 ms) with BRD and negative T wave in V1-V5 (unchanged). Chest X-ray: pleural effusion predominantly left. No increase in interstitial pattern. Cardiac silhouette unchanged with respect to previous studies. Left ventricular assistance and ICD normoimplanted. Analysis on admission: Hb 12.5 mg/dl, leukocytes 9,450 without alteration of the formula. Glucose 97, ALT 15; GGT 98; FA 112; Cr 1.92; Na 135; K+ 4.0; NTproBNP 4714; TSH 2.31; T4 1.6. CBC at discharge: Hb 12.2, creatinine 2.1; Na 137, K 3.9, NTProBNP 1643. Transthoracic echocardiogram on admission: very limited study due to the poor window. Left ventricle with dyskinetic movement of the septum. Global function appears severely depressed. Segmental contraction cannot be assessed. Right ventricle not dilated, with apparently normal systolic function. Transesophageal echocardiogram on admission: outflow tract at the level of the LV apex positioned close to the anterior interventricular septum, without clear obstruction. Predominantly systolic flow with a high peak end-systolic flow of 54 mHg (3.6 m/s). No evidence of intraventricular thrombus. Entrance cannula in ascending aorta with laminar flow, systolic peak 1.1 m/s, diastolic peak 0.24 m/s. No thrombus in LVOT or aortic root. Left aortic valve free of thrombus with a velocity of around 20 cm/s. Sclerocalcified aortic valve, opening is observed in all beats. Mild (I) commissural insufficiency. Left ventricle not dilated, moderately depressed global systolic function. Long axis DTD of 48.5 mm. Short-axis fractional area change (transgastric) of 48%. Non-dilated right ventricle with slightly reduced global function (although larger compared to the left), acceptable global function. Interventricular septum with slight bulging towards the LV. Atrial septum intact, slightly bulging to the left. No pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram after reduction of the assist revolutions: inflow cannula at the level of the LV apex positioned close to the anterior interventricular septum, without obstruction. Continuous flow with a maximum end-systolic peak of 18 mHg and peak velocity of 2.1 m/s (decrease from previous TEE). Adequate centration of the IVS, without ballooning to the right or left cavities. The rest was unchanged with respect to the previous study. Haemodynamic study on admission: AD 16. VD 41/22. PCP 17. AP 32/ 16 mean 24. GTP 7. Cardiac output Fick 7.7; thermodilution 6.9. Haemodynamic study at discharge: CVP 8 mmHg; BP 32/11/18 mmHg; PCP 14 mmHg; thermodilution CO 4.9 (CI 2.5 l/min); Fick CO 5.3 l/min (CI 2.8). SVR 947 dynes.  EVOLUTION After admission to Cardiology, a haemodynamic study was initially performed, which showed increased right and left pressures with high cardiac output (CO 7 l/min, PCP 18, DBP 16 mmHg). In view of this result, treatment was adjusted with an increase in diuretics, which was not tolerated due to worsening renal function. A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed with recovery of partial LVEF (shortening faction 48%) with interventricular septum slightly deviated to the left and suction events in the systoles due to increased contractility. The right ventricle persists with good radial function and no cavity dilatation. Aortic valve opening was observed in all beats (previously closed), with no intracavitary thrombi. To rule out extracardiac causes, a study of pleural fluid compatible with transudate and a chest CT scan was performed, showing no tumour lesion or infectious consolidation, with passive atelectasis of the left lung due to the effusion. Given the absence of thrombosis data and the recovery of contractility and myocardial function, a diagnosis of high output heart failure with high right and left filling pressures was made, so the assist speed was reduced to 8,800 rpm (parameters after lowering: speed 8,800 rpm, output 4.2-4.5 l/min, pulsatility index 6.5-7, power 4.8 W). After this, the clinical symptoms of dyspnoea and chest pain resolved and the eventual disappearance of the PI on the alarms. Right catheterisation and TEE showed a normal haemodynamic situation and disappearance of suction events, with pulsatile flow through the assistance but with peak velocities of around 2-2.4 m/s.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 53-year-old male with no known drug allergies or previous cardiological history. As cardiovascular risk factors, the patient had hypertension and type 2 DM for years and was treated with metformin 850 1/12h and irbersartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300/12.5 1/24h. The patient has a history of nephritic colic (the last one a year ago) and underwent otorhinolaryngological examination for progressive bilateral hypoacusis with a diagnosis of chronic sound trauma. The patient consulted for progressive dyspnoea in the last few months until he became moderately laboured. He presented with orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea in the last 15 days, accompanied by a progressive decrease in diuresis and increased oedema in the lower limbs. She denies chest pain. She does not report febrile syndrome. A week ago he was diagnosed with possible parotitis, due to bilateral parotid swelling, more marked on the right side. On physical examination the patient is conscious, oriented and cooperative, in good general condition, with good peripheral perfusion. There was swelling of both parotid glands, the right one with a stony consistency. BP 126/55, HR 91 bpm. CBC: PVY normal. AC: rhythmic heart sounds, holodiastolic murmur in aortic focus. AP: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen nondescript. IIJS: oedema with fovea up to the knees.

Middle sternotomy wires.  EVOLUTION The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a slightly dilated and hypertrophic LV with preserved systolic function and the existence of a trivalve aortic valve with severe insufficiency at the expense of the right coronary leaflet that appears to present a flail. On the other hand, given the findings of the examination, serological studies were requested, which ruled out an infectious origin. Laboratory data showed hypercalcaemia and elevated ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) levels as the most relevant findings and, together with the chest X-ray showing a prominence of both pulmonary hilums compatible with lymphadenopathy, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis with parotid and cardiac involvement was established. Chest CT showed multiple mediastinal, hilar and subcarinal adenopathies, as well as a predominant interstitial pattern in the vertex and bases. To confirm the diagnosis, it was decided to perform a parotid FNA and finally fibrobronchoscopy with biopsy of one of the lymph nodes with the presence of non-caseating granulomas, confirming the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient underwent aortic valve replacement. The valve was described as a very thin, sagging right coronary leaflet, with no aortic annulus in that area, with prolapse of the left leaflet and retraction of the non-coronary leaflet, for which reason it was decided to implant a mechanical prosthesis. The surgical specimen was sent for anatomopathological examination, which confirmed the existence of non-caseating granulomas compatible with sarcoidosis. Two months after surgery, cardiac MRI showed a slightly dilated and hypertrophic LV with pathological Gadolinium uptake in the subepicardial region, predominantly in the posterobasal segment, compatible with cardiac involvement in the context of systemic sarcoidosis. At present, the patient is asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view with functional grade I/IV in outpatient follow-up by internal medicine and cardiology and with treatment with corticoids without having presented new episodes of decompensation since hospital discharge.  DIAGNOSIS Systemic sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement. Severe aortic insufficiency due to sarcoid valve involvement. Aortic valve replacement by mechanical prosthesis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 53-year-old male admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) after recovering from cardiorespiratory arrest in the street.  Personal history Arterial hypertension under treatment with enalapril 20 mg. Type 2 diabetes mellitus being treated with metformin. Hyperuricaemia with several episodes of gouty arthritis. On treatment with allopurinol.  Present illness Witnesses report that, while working (cook) and without reporting any previous symptoms, he fainted with loss of consciousness. After the initial approach by the witnesses, 112 was contacted, the absence of breathing or signs of life was detected and basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were started. After 7 minutes, following the arrival of Basic Life Support (112), a defibrillable rhythm is detected by AED. Up to 4 shocks with the corresponding 30:2 cycles were applied together with 2 boluses of adrenaline and 300 mg of amiodarone. After the fourth shock, the patient recovered sinus rhythm at 92 bpm and was transferred to the CICU sedated, intubated and connected to mechanical ventilation.  Physical examination Sedoanalgesia. RASS -4. Pupils isochoric, miotic and reactive. BP 95/45; HR 125 bpm; peripheral O2 saturation 100% with FiO2 of 100%. Rhythmic, tachycardic heart sounds without murmurs. Bladder murmur preserved bilaterally. Abdomen slightly distended and tympanic. Bowel sounds present. Lower limbs without oedema and bilateral pulses present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: haemoglobin 14.5 g/dl; leucocytes 12,900 (36 % N); platelets 191.000; prothrombin activity 100 %; creatinine 1.2 mg/dl; GFR (MDRD-4) 67 ml/min; glucose 293 mg/dl; BUN 17 U/L; sodium 142 mee/l; potassium 3.9 meq/l; GOT 197 U/l; GPT 159 U/L; troponin I 0.045 ng/ml; NT-proBNP 636 pg/ml; CRP < 5 mg/l. Peak troponin I: 3 ng/ml. Urine toxicity: cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis negative. Chest X-ray: slight increase in cardiothoracic index. No evidence of infiltrates. Endotracheal tube is centred and normally positioned. A-B balance on arrival: pH 7.34; pO2 427; pCO2 48; HCO3 25.9; lactic 7.6 mmol/l. Transthoracic echocardiography: slightly hypertrophic left ventricle with segmental alterations of contractility. Moderately reduced left ventricular systolic function. Prolonged left ventricular relaxation (E/é 9). Absence of valvular heart disease. Right ventricle of normal size with normal systolic function. Cranial CT: no significant alterations in the density of the brain parenchyma. Ventricular system of normal size and morphology, without displacements with respect to the midline. No signs of intracranial bleeding were observed. Cardiac magnetic resonance: non-dilated left ventricle with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. Intramyocardial patchy intramyocardial enhancement in anterior and posterior mid-apical face. Findings compatible with acute myocarditis.  EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the CICU and femoral venous access was channelled for induced hypothermia for the first 24 hours at 33°C. He was kept sedated and anaesthetised. He remained sedated and relaxed, with a tendency to bradycardia and arterial hypotension. The internal environment was corrected and lactacidemia and pH were normalised. After 24 hours of hypothermia, progressive rewarming began, relaxation was withdrawn and sedation was gradually discontinued. Seventy-two hours after admission, the patient presented with abnormal movements, such as shivering, coinciding with an increase in temperature (38°C), for which reason an EEG was requested, which ruled out the presence of status convulsus. Antibiotic therapy was intensified (ceftriaxone + clindamycin) after finding a right basal infiltrate on X-ray, probably related to aspiration during intubation. Weaning progressed to extubation on the 5th day. The cranial CT scan after extubation showed no alterations of interest. Monitoring in the CICU detected the presence of ventricular extrasystoles without sustained arrhythmias. Coronary angiography showed coronary arteries free of significant obstructive lesions. Once on the hospital ward, he remained in asymptomatic rehabilitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed patchy intramyocardial uptake compatible with myocarditis and left ventricular function was moderately depressed (38%). Two weeks after admission, a single-chamber ICD was implanted, without incident, for secondary prevention of sudden death secondary to cardiomyopathy due to myocarditis.  DIAGNOSIS Cardiorespiratory arrest recovered. Aspirative pneumonia. Cardiomyopathy secondary to myocarditis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of a 33-year-old man who presented with ventricular fibrillation and cardiorespiratory arrest after taking ibuprofen.  HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history No known hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia. Mental and behavioural disorder due to alcohol consumption, in remission. Mixed adaptive distress. Intrinsic rhinitis and bronchial asthma and history of atopy since childhood. Very doubtful drug allergy years ago, she does not remember to which drug, which has not been studied. No previous cardiological history. No chronic treatment.  Current illness She came to the emergency department with an incised-contuse wound on the right forearm following an accident at work with an iron. The wound was treated locally, requiring suturing and bandaging. Gamma globulin and a first dose of tetanus vaccine were administered. On discharge a series of recommendations were given: treatment with ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours for 5-7 days in the presence of pain and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 500-125 mg every 8 hours for 8 days. In the evening, the patient, because of severe pain in the forearm, decided to take 1 tablet of ibuprofen. Thirty minutes after taking it, he began to feel nausea, vomiting, sweating and sudden dyspnoea, so his wife called 061. On arrival of the ambulance, the patient was pale and sweaty, suffering cardiorespiratory arrest in their presence, so they started CPR manoeuvres and performed an ECG which showed ventricular fibrillation. The patient was resuscitated for 75 minutes and required 5 defibrillations at 200 J, 450 mg intravenous amiodarone, 12 mg adrenaline, 1 M intravenous bicabonate and orotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation. Referred to ICU for further care after recovery of pulse.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS 061 electrocardiogram: ventricular fibrillation. ICU blood tests: troponin T 21 ng/ml (normal up to 0.05 ng/ml), creatinine 1.47mg/dl, urea 42 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium 4.1 mEq/l, glycaemia 159 mg/dl. Haemoglobin 17 g/dl, haematocrit 51%, leucocytes 16,000 10e3/ul, platelets 359,000 10e3/ul. PT ratio 1.1 (0.8-1.3), aPTT ratio 2 (0.8-1.3). Arterial blood gases (FiO2: 50 %): pH 7.30, PCO2 41, PO2 201, bicarbonate 19, lactate 4.2. Electrocardiogram on admission to ICU: sinus rhythm at 78 bpm, PR < 200 ms, electrical axis deviated to the right. Wide QRS with image of complete right bundle branch block with secondary repolarisation alterations. Chest X-ray in AP: cardiothoracic index not assessable. Free costophrenic and cardiophrenic sinuses. Right hilar slightly congestive. No parenchymal nodules or masses or pleural pathology. Simple skull CT scan: findings compatible with significant diffuse cerebral oedema. Echocardiogram: LV neither dilated nor hypertrophic, severe systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesia (probably secondary to stunning) and akinesia in the LAD territory. Normal valves. No tricuspid insufficiency or indirect data of pulmonary hypertension. Normal atria. Normal RV. Severe systolic dysfunction of probable ischaemic origin in the LAD territory and stunning component. Cardiac catheterisation: epicardial arteries without angiographically visible lesions.  EVOLUTION On arrival at the ICU the patient was intubated, comatose with 3 points on the Glasgow scale. Pupils are mydriatic, reactive and symmetrical. The patient remains under hypothermia protocol at 34°C under sedation and connected to invasive mechanical ventilation. Anticoagulated at that time with enoxaparin and double anti-aggregation with ASA and clopidogrel in the presence of clinical suspicion of AMI. The electrocardiogram showed the patient in sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block which was not known to be present previously. An urgent CT scan of the brain showed significant cerebral oedema and an echocardiogram showed severe systolic dysfunction, alterations in contractility in the LAD territory and a stunning component. Given the results of the echocardiogram, cardiac catheterisation was performed, showing epicardial coronary arteries without lesions, and intensive care continued in the ICU. The patient died two days later. Given the relationship with the intake of NSAIDs and the symptoms suggesting a high probability of anaphylactic shock, the patient was finally classified as probable Kounis syndrome with a fatal outcome.  DIAGNOSIS Out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest in ventricular fibrillation, resuscitated. Related to taking ibuprofen in a patient with a previous history of drug allergy and bronchial asthma. Severe LV systolic dysfunction with segmental alteration in the LAD territory. Coronary arteries without angiographic lesions. Presumptive diagnosis of Kounis syndrome type I. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 44-year-old man was referred to the emergency department after attending a private clinic for his annual company medical check-up, because an alteration was detected in the ECG reported as "arrhythmic conduction of the P waves, with suspected atrioventricular block of 2nd degree".  HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal and family history No known cardiovascular risk factors. Never smoked, occasionally drinks some wine or beer with meals. He is a recreational sportsman: he cycles to work and goes on longer outings at weekends, also goes hiking and occasionally plays football or paddle tennis. No known heart disease or other medical or surgical history of interest. Mother with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, currently with moderate systolic dysfunction, pacemaker wearer since the age of 55 and with radiofrequency ablation of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) at the age of 61.  Present illness The patient went to a private clinic for an annual company check-up and the ECG showed what was described as "arrhythmic conduction of the P waves, suspected 2nd degree AVB" and he was referred to his health centre. His family doctor performed a new ECG and referred him to the emergency department. The patient denies any related symptoms (no dizziness, no asthenia, no syncope). He does not understand why he is here.  Physical examination BP 119/73 mmHg. HR 57 bpm. Ta 36°C. Good general condition. Arrhythmic cardiac auscultation by extratonos, without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation with preservation of vesicular murmur. Abdomen and extremities normal, without oedema and with normal pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm with complete atrioventricular block and escape rhythm at 45-50 bpm. EV monomorphic, with BCRDHH morphology and inferior axis (isolated, with some duplet). CBC: glucose 89 mg/dl, urea 34 mg/dl, creatinine 0.87 mg/dl, total cholesterol 167 mg/dl, triglycerides 88 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 32 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 117 mg/dl, sodium 144 mEq/l, potassium 5.4 mEq/l, troponin I 0.044 (normal, < 0.01μg/l), CK 7.3, CK-MB 4.40. Haemogram: haemoglobin 14.8 g/dl, haematocrit 43.9%, MCV 83.9 fl, platelets 239,000, leucocytes 7,520. Echocardiogram: LV slightly dilated (LVEDD 59 mm, LVEDV 183 cc) with normal wall thickness. Mild LA dilatation. Marked asynchrony of contraction at the level of the interventricular septum, with mild global hypokinesia and LVEF by volumetry of 43% (mild systolic dysfunction). Trivalve aortic valve, normal. Mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary valves of normal morphology and mobility. Mitral filling pattern with E>>A wave with no data suggesting increased LV filling pressures. Right ventricle not dilated, of normal thickness, without alterations of regional contractility and with preserved global systolic function. Mild TR with PSAP estimated at 26 mmHg. Inferior vena cava and suprahepatic veins were not dilated, with adequate inspiratory collapse, which excludes the presence of significant systemic venous hypertension. Cardio MRI: LV of normal thickness, slightly dilated (248 mL TVD; 115 mL/m2 of CS) with slightly reduced ejection fraction (EF 48%), normal segmental contractility. RV of normal global and segmental dimensions and contractility. Linear mesocardial enhancement is identified in the basal septum, with extension to the mid-segment. Conclusions: mild LV dilatation and systolic dysfunction, with basal mesoseptal linear fibrosis extending to the mid-segment (His bundle area). Chest X-ray (post-implantation): normal cardiothoracic index, no images of pneumothorax or other complications. Atrial and ventricular electrode well positioned and generator at left subclavicular level. Exercise echocardiogram: 9.30 min of Bruce protocol exercise. The test is stopped due to fatigue at 93% of maximum theoretical heart rate. Basically and up to minute 7, sinus rhythm conducted by ventricular stimulation by the pacemaker; in minute 7 there is alternation of pacemaker rhythm with own rhythm and ventricular extrasystoles, causing a marked irregularity in the heart rate; from 130 bpm it remains in own rhythm with subsequent reappearance of the pacemaker rhythm in the immediate post-exercise. Normal tension response. Contractility slightly depressed at baseline with global hypokinesia and estimated LVEF of 40-45%, with improvement of around 10 points with exercise. The test was clinically and echocardiographically negative for ischaemia, with a pattern of improvement in contractility with exercise (contractile reserve) suggesting cardiomyopathy. ECG not assessable due to baseline pacemaker rhythm.  EVOLUTION Although the patient was completely asymptomatic and the block was detected by chance, it was decided to admit him to hospital with continuous ECG monitoring, and he remained in complete AVB at all times, although with adequate escape rhythm and totally asymptomatic. It was decided to implant a definitive bicameral pacemaker, with prior cardiac MRI. Twenty-four hours after the procedure, once complications related to the procedure had been ruled out, the patient was discharged from hospital. If familial dilated cardiomyopathy associated with atrioventricular conduction disorders is suspected, the patient is referred to the Family Cardiopathies Unit (UCF) of reference for genetic study. Likewise, a schedule of visits is programmed for review of the device and follow-up in Cardiology consultations. At subsequent check-ups, the patient reported feeling well. Following pacemaker implantation, he has moderated his sporting activities considerably, following medical recommendations. A stress echocardiogram was performed with the results described, so moderate physical exercise was not contraindicated. In the periodic reviews of the device, several episodes of NSVT were detected (about 10 in a year, of short duration). We insisted on the family history and the patient commented that his maternal grandmother, who died suddenly at the age of 69, had been considered for a pacemaker implant during her lifetime, which was never carried out. She has 3 brothers, one of whom (a 47-year-old male) has just been diagnosed with a 2nd degree atrioventricular block (he lives in another Community; during follow-up, a permanent pacemaker was implanted). She has two other sisters and two children aged 12 and 8, with no evidence of heart disease after screening of family members. Finally, more than a year after the pacemaker implantation, the results of the genetic analysis were received, in which 34 genes involved in conduction system diseases were evaluated, reporting that the patient is a heterozygous carrier of the Glu444* truncation, considered to be pathogenic or associated with disease. A defibrillator implantation is proposed, which the patient accepts.  DIAGNOSIS Asymptomatic complete atrioventricular block. Carrier of a definitive bicameral pacemaker. Familial dilated cardiomyopathy with associated AV conduction disorder due to laminopathy A/C. Mild LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF 45-50%). Repeat NSVT, asymptomatic (detected by pacemaker). Defibrillator implantation in primary prevention. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 57-year-old woman presented with dyspnoea and fever, diagnosed with infective endocarditis on native valve due to Lactobacillus rhamnosus (a rare bacterium, widely used as a probiotic).  HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history No known drug allergies. Toxic habits: smoker of 1 pack/day. Intervened for pneumothorax more than 15 years ago. Admitted 11 days earlier to the Respiratory Department with the diagnosis of probable moderate COPD and respiratory infection treated with levofloxacin for 7 days with good evolution. Blood cultures during this admission, positive for Lactobacillus rhamnosus, interpreted by the laboratory as possible contamination. Current treatment: citalopram 20 mg, inhaled glycopyrronium and paracetamol. Baseline functional status: higher functions preserved, works as a shop assistant in a clothing shop. Lives with her husband and children.  Present illness Progressive dyspnoea of 3 days evolution. Today dyspnoea at rest. 4 days ago, fever peak of up to 37.8°C and pain in right hip which subsided on its own, for which she did not consult.  Physical examination BP 110/62, HR 115 bpm, Ta 37.7°C, O2 Sat (Ventimask 40 %) 95 %. Tachypnoea of 18 rpm. On inspection, the patient was normal colour, with good hydration of skin and mucous membranes. On cardiac auscultation, the heart is rhythmic, with systolic murmur mitral focus. Pulmonary auscultation shows crackles in the middle and lower fields and scattered wheezing. The abdomen is soft and depressible, painless on palpation with sounds present. The lower extremities are free of oedema and the paedial pulses are present and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus tachycardia at 115 bpm. Chest X-ray: cardiac silhouette at the upper limit of normality. Laboratory tests: PO2 80 mmHg; PCO2 34 mmHg; pH 7.49; HCO3 25.9 mmol/l; lactate 10 mg/dl. Glucose 112 mg/dl; creatinine 0.63 mg/dl; GPT 15 U/l; Na 137 mmol/l; K 3.99 mmol/l; CK 16 U/l; LDH 194 U/l; CRP 11.29 mg/dl; PCT 0.18 ng/ml. Hb 10.3 g/dl; platelets 207,000/μL; leukocytes 9,200/μL (N 78.5 %). IP 100 %; INR 1. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram: the left ventricle is not dilated or hypertrophic, with good global systolic function and hyperdynamic. The mitral valve shows several images, the largest measuring 19 x 6 mm, compatible with endocardial vegetations. The posterior leaflet shows a large perforation leading to massive regurgitation. The aortic valve shows an image in the LVOT dependent on the non-coronary leaflet (13 x 6 mm), which appears perforated and there is a significant coaptation defect leading to severe regurgitation in relation to the involvement of the right coronary artery. The right ventricle is not dilated, with good systolic function. No pericardial effusion was observed Coronary angiography: coronary network without lesions.  EVOLUTION In view of the findings described above, the patient was admitted to the Coronary Unit, where the TEE was performed. Treatment was started with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. Given that she was admitted with heart failure, she underwent double valve replacement within 24 hours, aortic (Carbomedics Top Hat no. 21) and mitral (Bicarbon Fitline no. 27). The cardiac surgery was uneventful, with an ischaemia time of 102 min and CPB time of 123 min. The surgeon described the following intraoperative findings: warts on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, warts on the non-coronary leaflet of the aortic valve with the rings of both valves well preserved. The specimen was sent to anatomical pathology and microbiology for culture, subsequently confirming infection by Lactobacillus rhamnosus. He arrived at the Coronary Unit, from the operating theatre, haemodynamically unstable with noradrenaline at 0.2 μg/kg/min, in sinus tachycardia 135 bpm with BP 80/50 mmHg. Echocardioscopy (V-Scan) was performed, showing severe biventricular dysfunction (estimated LVEF 10%), without pericardial effusion. The findings were confirmed, as well as the normofunction of both prostheses by TEE. Therefore, intensive serum therapy was started and noradrenaline (up to 2 μg/kg/min), dopamine (up to 20 μg/kg/min) and adrenaline (up to 0.4 μg/kg/min) were progressively administered in increasing doses. With this, we achieved a MAP 65-70 mmHg, CVP 18 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, CO 3.2 L/min and IC 2.3 L/min/m2. However, he persisted with oliguria and increasing lividity in the atria and lower extremities in an ascending manner. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation implantation was chosen. Despite counterpulsation (1:1) and the "stability" of haemodynamic parameters, the data of cardiogenic shock with peripheral hypoperfusion were increasing (lactate 10 --> 145 mg/dl; creatinine 0.63 --> 2.19 mg/dl; GPT 15 --> 3,068 U/l). Therefore, veno-arterial ECMO implantation with peripheral access is indicated, guided by TEE, which is carried out successfully. Subsequently, the patient evolved favourably, with a progressive decrease in the analytical parameters of peripheral hypoperfusion, and the doses of inovasoactive drugs were gradually reduced. Finally, after 14 days, IABP was withdrawn and 24 hours later, ECMO was withdrawn, with good haemodynamic tolerance. After 30 days in the Intensive Care Unit, she was discharged to the hospital ward.  DIAGNOSIS Infective endocarditis on native mitral and aortic valves due to Lactobacillus rhamnosus, complicated by heart failure. Mitral and aortic valve replacement surgery. Cardiogenic shock after cardiac surgery requiring assistance with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and ECMO, with good evolution. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of an 81-year-old man with no known previous heart disease who was admitted to our department for dyspnoea and oedema in the lower limbs.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history HYPERTENSION. Dyslipidaemia. Diabetes Mellitus type II. Morbid obesity. COPD. SAHS in treatment with CPAP. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. Episode of deep vein thrombosis in the right lower extremity. Usual treatment: torsemide 10 mg (1-0-0), valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 160/12.5 mg (1-0-0), simvastatin 10 mg (0-0-1), metformin 850 mg (0-1-0), doxium 500 mg (1-0-1).  Present illness The patient was admitted from the Emergency Department with slowly progressive dyspnoea for approximately two months, until minimal effort, together with oliguria and oedema in the lower extremities. A week ago he presented a catarrhal condition consisting of nasal congestion, cough and whitish expectoration, for which reason he attended his health centre, increasing diuretic treatment and starting empirical antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875/125 mg for a week. With little improvement of the symptoms after 5 days of treatment, she went to the emergency department.  Physical examination BP 160/80 mmHg, HR 71 bpm, SatO2 92 % on room air, Ta 36.7°C. Conscious and oriented in time and place. Obese. Well hydrated, good peripheral perfusion. Slight tachypnoea at rest, no signs of work of breathing. Jugular venous pressure not measurable. AC: muffled cardiac tones with no clear murmurs. PA: crackles in both bases. Abdomen globular, depressible, without pain on palpation. Extremities with oedema with fovea up to the root of the thighs, signs of chronic venous insufficiency.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: atypical atrial flutter with controlled ventricular response at 75 bpm. HRBBB with secondary repolarisation alterations. Laboratory tests on admission: glucose 92 mg/dl, urea 60 mg/dl, creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, albumin 3.76 g/dl, liver function normal, sodium 145 mmol/l, potassium 3.81 mmol/l, CRP 0.6 mg/ml, haemoglobin 12.9 g/dl, leucocytes 5,200 10^3/μL (N 52.8 %), platelets 128,000 10^3/μl. Chest X-ray: no cardiomegaly. Bilateral pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated LV, hypertrophic, with good global and segmental systolic function. Mitral valve with slight ring calcification and mild-moderate regurgitation. Aortic root not dilated. Thickened aortic valve, with an image of intermediate echogenicity, without being able to rule out endocardial involvement, with maximum and mean gradient of 50 and 26 mmHg respectively. Moderate-severe AoI. TEE is recommended for better assessment of these findings. Moderately dilated LA. Right chambers not dilated, RV with good function. Mild tricuspid regurgitation with Vd-Ad gradient of 34 mmHg. Estimated PsAP of 40 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram: thickened aortic valve with points of calcification, with severe regurgitation (IV/IV) with an image compatible with perforation at the level of the non-coronary leaflet. Small mobile image in the LVOT, somewhat hyperechogenic, measuring 0.7 x 0.3 cm, dependent on the leaflet. Mitral valve with mild-moderate regurgitation without pathological images.  EVOLUTION During his stay on the hospital ward, intravenous depletive treatment was started with slowly progressive improvement of the congestive signs. After a first episode of heart failure, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed followed by a transesophageal echocardiogram with the findings described, compatible with endocarditis. The Infectious Diseases Department was contacted for an interdisciplinary assessment of the condition. Despite the atypical nature of the symptoms, panbacterial PCR was requested, as well as blood and urine cultures, empirical treatment was adjusted for possible endocarditis (ampicillin + cloxacillin + gentamicin) adjusted to renal function and a new transesophageal echocardiogram was scheduled for follow-up, in which no significant differences were observed with respect to the previous study. During the following days, the cultures collected (blood and urine cultures) were negative and, despite increased intravenous diuretic treatment, the patient recorded a significant weight gain and worsening of oedema in the lower limbs with the appearance of phlyctenas, so given the unfavourable evolution of the condition, the case was discussed with Cardiac Surgery, who decided to perform aortic valve replacement with a biological prosthesis, maintaining antibiotic treatment while awaiting the microbiological results of the extracted heart valve. Among the analyses requested, the serology for Coxiella burnetti was positive, with high titres, allowing a diagnosis of endocarditis due to Q fever, so the antibiotic treatment regimen was modified and the patient was started on doxycycline + hydroxychloroquine, and he was discharged from hospital. During the months following discharge, the patient presented several episodes of decompensation of heart failure with bilateral pleural effusion, which required hygiene and dietary educational measures, intravenous depletive treatment, thoracentesis and inclusion of the patient in the heart failure telemonitoring programme, and he is currently in a situation of clinical stability with regular controls by the Cardiology and Infectious Diseases outpatient clinics.  DIAGNOSIS Endocarditis due to Q fever on native aortic valve. Aortic insufficiency due to perforation of the non-coronary aortic leaflet. Secondary congestive heart failure. Aortic valve replacement surgery for biological prosthesis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Discrete focal eccentric calcification in the right common femoral artery prior to bifurcation.  EVOLUTION The patient is an 85-year-old woman, with a biological aortic valve prosthesis and double coronary artery bypass grafting who was admitted with acute pulmonary oedema and severe aortic insufficiency was detected on echocardiography due to rupture of one of the leaflets of the biological aortic prosthesis. The patient was admitted in severe heart failure, requiring high doses of intravenous diuretics. After clinical stabilisation, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which confirmed the rupture of one of the aortic prosthesis leaflets, resulting in very severe aortic insufficiency. Given the severity of the valve disease, the case was presented at a medical-surgical session. Given the patient's advanced age and previous cardiac surgery in 2001, it was decided to implant an aortic valve prosthesis inside the previously implanted prosthesis, percutaneously from femoral access (TAVI valve in valve). Coronary angiography showed no new lesions and aortic CT angiography showed favourable femoral accesses for the procedure. By means of a catheter introduced through the left femoral arterial access, the correct right femoral arterial access is checked, through which it is passed by means of an Extra-Stiff guide. The Ewards Sapien 3 No 23 expandable prosthesis is advanced over this guide. It is expanded in the aortic position, remaining slightly under-expanded at the level of the ring of the previous Perimount prosthesis (Video 3 and 4). Transesophageal echocardiography is used to verify the normal position of the valve, the absence of regurgitation and the transvalvular gradients (max 37 mmHg). The absence of aortic regurgitation and absence of leakage after Prostar closure of the right femoral access is verified by angiography. The left femoral access is closed with Angio-Seal. After the procedure, the patient was admitted to the Coronary Unit extubated, haemodynamically stable, with initially fair O2 saturations in the context of sedation after the procedure and signs of mild pulmonary congestion, which evolved well with diuretic treatment. He also presented with acute renal failure prior to the procedure, with a creatinine peak of 2.2 which resolved during admission (urea 122 at discharge, creatinine 1.06). He remained in his own rhythm during admission (sinus with LBBB and long PR, already present before the procedure), with no other arrhythmic events in telemetry, so the transient jugular PM was removed. On the hospital ward, he had a very good clinical evolution. Congestion data disappeared, remaining stable at all times. A control echocardiogram showed residual moderate aortic stenosis after the procedure, without aortic insufficiency. Good appearance of the femoral arterial accesses, with slight haematomas, without major complications. In good clinical condition, she was discharged home.  DIAGNOSIS Acute heart failure due to severe aortic insufficiency. Biological aortic prosthesis with severe insufficiency due to leaflet rupture. Implantation of Edwards Sapien 3 (valve in valve) percutaneous valvular aortic prosthesis. LV function borderline-slightly depressed. Acute renal failure, resolved. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 67-year-old man attended a Cardiology consultation due to worsening dyspnoea. Cardiovascular risk factors: Ex-smoker (20 packs/year) and hypertensive under treatment. Cardiological history: left bundle branch block as an incidental finding in a routine electrocardiogram; diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease with moderate LV hypertrophy and mild systolic dysfunction in the echocardiogram. The Holter study was completed and showed frequent ventricular extrasystoles (asymptomatic). Medical treatment: nevibolol 5 mg, torasemide 5 mg and amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg once daily. Current history: previously in NYHA functional class I, he consulted Cardiology for worsening of his dyspnoea of one year's evolution, to the point of moderate exertion. He denied syncope, palpitations or other symptoms. Physical examination showed no relevant findings. Head and neck with no increase in jugular venous pressure or carotid murmurs. Rhythmic cardiac auscultation with abundant extrasystoles, but no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation showed decreased generalised vesicular murmur, with no other superimposed sounds. The abdomen was globular with no masses or megaliths and the lower limbs were free of oedema and there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm, normal PR, left bundle branch block (QRS of 150 ms). Holter: sinus rhythm throughout the recording. Monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles of slight-moderate density, with some triplets. Occasional supraventricular extrasystoles with isolated episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. No pauses. Echocardiogram, new study: non-dilated left ventricle, with moderate septal hypertrophy (1.5 cm) and alterations in segmental contractility: basal hypokinesia of the inferior, anterior, anteroseptal and anterolateral faces, with anomalous septal movement. Mild systolic dysfunction (LVEF 45%). Grade II diastolic dysfunction, with pseudonormal pattern. Normal right ventricle. Slightly dilated atria (LA 25 and RA 21 cm2). Minimal aortic insufficiency, without other valvulopathies. Cardiac MRI: left ventricle slightly dilated, with moderate to severe concentric increase in wall thickness, maximum thickness measured in the inferior septum of the middle segment of 22 mm. Significant increase in myocardial mass (116 gr/m2), global hypokinesia and moderate systolic dysfunction (LVEF 37%). Right ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophied with normal function (RVEF 59%). Moderately dilated left atrium with thickening of the interatrial septum in its most caudal area. Absence of pericardial and pleural effusion. Late enhancement sequences show a diffuse uptake pattern, with greater intensity in the subendocardium in the middle segments of the lateral and inferolateral face, diffuse intramyocardial uptake of the basal and middle septum and at the level of the posterior septum at the insertion of the free wall. There is also subepicardial enhancement in the free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract. The wall of both atria shows diffuse uptake, as well as the interatrial septum, mitral valve and aortic wall. On the STIR sequence, no oedema is seen. The T2 sequence shows no evidence of iron overload. Salivary gland biopsy: no amyloid deposition. 99mTc-DDP scan: myocardial deposition of the radiotracer, indicative of cardiac amyloidosis. Endomyocardial biopsy: (sampling from 2 different sites in the right ventricle) positive deposit of amyloid substance transthyretin (TTR). Genetic study: (NGS sequencing 17 genes panel, including TTR): negative.  EVOLUTION Patient known to Cardiology with a previous diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease. After worsening of his CF, the echocardiogram was repeated, revealing significant LV hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction with pseudonormal pattern and data of increased end-diastolic pressures. With the suspicion of infiltrative cardiomyopathy, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was requested, which showed findings highly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis. The patient was studied by quantification of immunoglobulins, electrophoresis and immunofixation of proteins and 24-hour urine study, ruling out multiple myeloma. Bone scintigraphy 99 mTc-DDP was also requested, with cardiac uptake of the radiotracer, compatible with senile and/or hereditary amyloidosis due to TTR deposition. The precise diagnosis was made by endomyocardial biopsy, which showed TTR deposition. Finally, genetic testing was performed to discern between hereditary and senile amyloidosis. Once the latter was diagnosed, it was not necessary to study the patient's relatives. The patient was managed conservatively, with treatment aimed at systolic dysfunction, diuretics and antihypertensive drugs, with a good clinical response after 2 years of follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin deposition. Senile type. Moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction of vi. Compensated heart failure in NYHA functional class I after medication. Asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular extrasystoles of mild to moderate intensity. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
54-year-old woman. She consulted the Hereditary Cardiomyopathies department for a genetic study due to family history.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history CVRF: family history of early sudden death, early complete atrioventricular block, early complete AVB and dilated cardiomyopathy. No known hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia. No previous cardiological history. No other history of interest. No home medication.  Family history: 63-year-old brother (index case): atrial fibrillation (AF) and complete AVB with pacemaker implantation at age 50. DCM (LVEF 34%) with normal coronary angiography. Monomorphic SVT and syncope with ICD implantation at 57 years of age. 59-year-old brother with complete AVB and pacemaker implantation at age 49. Normal TTE. 55-year-old brother with complete AVB and pacemaker implantation at age 50. TTE this year with LVEF 30-35%. Mild-moderate dilatation of the left ventricle (LV). All of them have LMNA p332fs mutation. Two maternal uncles, mother and brother died of sudden death before the age of 55.  Current disease Consultation for screening for LMNA p332fs mutation. Asymptomatic. Asthenia in the last year which has not prevented her from leading a normal life. After finding a complete AVB in the ECG, she was admitted.  Physical examination Afebrile. HR 50 bpm. BP 143/83 mmHg. SatO2 99 %. AC: RsCsRs with mitral systolic murmur II/VI. AP: VCM. Abdomen nondescript. EEII without oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: AF at 37 bpm with complete paroxysmal AVB. Transthoracic echocardiography: mild LV dilatation. Slightly depressed systolic function (LVEF 45%). Mild-moderate functional MR. Telemetry: asymptomatic slow AF with self-limited bouts of full BAV with narrow QRS nodal escape and no pauses or VT. Blood count and coagulation: normal. Biochemistry: normal CK and NT-proBNP 1238 pg/ml. Genetic study: carrier of LMNA p332fs mutation.  EVOLUTION During hospitalisation, telemetry showed asymptomatic slow AF with self-limited bouts of complete AVB with narrow QRS nodal escape and no pauses, remaining asymptomatic. The problem we faced was to decide which device to implant in this patient (conventional pacemaker, ICD, ICD-CRT) and also to continue the family screening study for the mutation. Finally, the decision was made to implant an ICD-CRT, in accordance with the available scientific evidence (see discussion).  DIAGNOSIS Slow atrial fibrillation with spells of complete atrioventricular block. Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with dilated left ventricle with mild-moderate systolic dysfunction (LVEF 45%). Carrier of LMNA p 332fs mutation. Extensive family history of sudden death, complete AVB and dilated cardiomyopathy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 47-year-old male diagnosed with HCM at the age of 44 years, following a family screening after his 7-year-old daughter presented with a recovered sudden death. Genetic testing showed a troponin I mutation (TNNI3) in the index case, our patient being a carrier. At the time of diagnosis, he was oligosymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view: he reported NYHA functional class I-II and denied symptoms of palpitations, chest pain, dizziness or syncope.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: sinus rhythm. Narrow QRS with -30o axis. Left ventricular overload voltage criteria. CBC: Hb 13 g/dl, Cr 1 mg/dl, normal ions, NT-proBNP 1,000 pg/ml. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. Mild vascular redistribution to upper fields. Echocardiogram: LV of normal diameter with moderate asymmetric septal hypertrophy (15 mm) with no obstruction across the left ventricular outflow tract, no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 48-50 %) and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Dilated left atrium (67 mm). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): late gadolinium enhancement irregularly distributed in the medial wall of the entire septum, anterior wall and free wall of the right ventricle. IVS 15 mm. Severe left atrial dilatation. Ergometry: sinus rhythm during recording. Supraventricular extrasystoles and ventricular extrasystoles (with BRDHH morphology) isolated.  EVOLUTION After the studies performed, an intermediate risk of sudden death was estimated (HCM 5-year SCD rate 4.7%), and ICD implantation was decided for primary prevention of sudden death. After a stable period of 3 years, he reported progressive clinical worsening in the last 6 months, presenting deterioration of functional class (CF NYHA III/IV). Physical examination revealed elevated jugular venous pressure and crackles on pulmonary auscultation. Laboratory tests showed elevated NT-proBNP up to 5,000 pg/ml, with the rest of the parameters in the normal range. The electrocardiogram was in sinus rhythm. A control echocardiogram was performed, which showed LV with moderate asymmetric septal hypertrophy, which had not progressed, with deterioration of LV systolic function (EF 40-45%). No dynamic gradient was observed in the LV outflow tract. He also had grade 3 diastolic dysfunction, with evidence of elevated filling pressures. Ergospirometry was performed, showing peak oxygen consumption of 16 ml/min/kg (57% of predicted) and right heart catheterisation, with evidence of postcapillary pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary capillary pressure: 24 mmHg, systolic pulmonary pressure of 55 mmHg, mean pulmonary artery pressure 32 mmHg). RV end-diastolic pressure was 16 mmHg. Neurohormonal treatment was started and, due to severe dilatation of the left atrium and thrombotic risk in case of falling into atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation was also started. The evolution in the following year was unfavourable despite optimal medical treatment, presenting dyspnoea on minimal exertion, with two admissions for decompensation of heart failure. A new determination of oxygen consumption was performed, estimating VO2 max of 12 ml/kg/min. Given the significant and progressive limitation of his functional capacity, he was referred to a reference centre as a candidate for heart transplant, undergoing a pre-transplant study and is currently on the waiting list for elective transplant.  DIAGNOSIS Non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mutation in the troponin I 3 gene (TNNI3). Recovered sudden death in first-degree relative. ICD carrier. Mild left ventricular dysfunction. Stage D heart failure. NYHA functional class III/IV. Candidate for elective heart transplant. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  The patient is a 48-year-old male, dyslipidaemic, with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction known since 2010. Years earlier, a genetic study had been performed, with the finding of an LMNA variant of uncertain significance in a gene related to laminopathy, consistent with the patient's phenotype: non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy associated with conduction disorder and ventricular arrhythmias, which had required multiple ablation procedures in the course of his disease. In addition, the patient had had a mechanical prosthesis ATS no. 25 since 2012 for a bicuspid aortic valve with severe insufficiency. During 2016, the patient was in advanced heart failure, in NYHA functional class IV, with severe LV systolic dysfunction on echocardiography requiring repeated admissions for severe decompensation. He was therefore included on the elective list for heart transplantation (INTERMACS 4). In the following weeks he presented progressive worsening despite periodic cycles of levosimendan, with increasingly frequent decompensations due to low output and congestion, the last of which did not improve despite inotropic support (INTERMACS 2). It was decided to implant a balloon counterpulsation device and to place him on urgent cardiac transplant list 1. Three weeks later, heart transplantation was performed by bicave technique, with good biventricular function at pump output. Immediate postoperative period without complications: little need for haemodynamic support, no rhythm disorders, extubation in the first twelve hours, no neurological deficit. No complications from the infectious point of view, she received prophylaxis according to the centre's protocol with norfloxacin, nystatin, cotrimoxazole (recipient with negative toxoplasma and unknown donor) and valganciclovir for 15 days due to intermediate risk (positive cytomegalovirus in donor and recipient).  Immunosuppression also according to protocol, consisting of: Two doses of basiliximab 20 mg on the first and fourth day. Intensive corticotherapy with methylprednisolone 125 mg every 8 h on the first day, followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, in a descending pattern. Tacrolimus, starting at 0.03 mg/kg/12 h and adjusting according to levels to target between 10 and 15 ng/ml at baseline. Mycophenolate mofetil sodium, 1,000 mg/12 h. Without evidence of rejection in successive biopsies and with serial echocardiograms with normofunctioning graft, preserved left and right ventricular ejection fraction, without valvular heart disease or pericardial effusion. In this context, while stable on the cardiology ward after an uncomplicated endomyocardial biopsy three hours earlier, he presented with an episode of eye twitching with sustained blinking, during which he was able to respond to commands, lasting one minute. This was followed by tonic-clonic movements of all four limbs lasting one minute. A few minutes after cessation, during which time he remained with visual disturbances and nystagmus to the left, he presented a new episode of generalised seizure, more prolonged, which ceased with benzodiazepines (10 mg diazepam), as well as levetiracetam 1,000 mg in perfusion, both intravenous. After resolution, the patient remained conscious, oriented and speech preserved. The threat reflex was bilaterally absent and at the time the patient reported exclusively shadow vision. Pupils were isochoric, normoreactive; leftward nystagmus maintained in primary gaze position. He was able to move all four limbs symmetrically, with the rest of the examination being unremarkable. Blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg. Once he improved, the patient admitted having had a mild holocranial headache in the previous days.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: haemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, Ht 37%, RDW 24%, platelets 107,000/μL, the rest without alterations. Coagulation: APTT 24.7 s, the rest without alterations. Biochemistry: glycaemia 106 mg/dl, GGT 285 IU/l, protein 5.8 g/dl. Renal function preserved (creatinine 0.88 mg/dl, GFR MDRD-4 > 60 ml/min). Ions in normal range (Na+ 138 mmol/l, K+ 4.4 mmol/l). CRP <0.1 mg/L. Venous blood gases: pH 7.21, bicarbonate 18 mg/dl, lactate 13.1 mg/dl, the rest without alterations Cranial CT scan: multiple posterior temporal and parieto-occipital hypodense lesions, as well as right frontal and in both cerebellar hemispheres, although also predominantly on the right. Brain MRI: vasogenic oedema symmetrically affecting the subcortical white matter of almost all of both occipital lobes and occipito-parieto-temporal regions. In these areas, multiple millimetric foci of hypointensity and cortico-subcortical distribution can be seen, which are compatible with microbleeds.  EVOLUTION The patient was immediately evaluated by Neurology, who, given the finding of seizures together with previous headache and visual disturbances in a patient being treated with tacrolimus, suspected the most likely diagnosis to be posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Both CT and MRI, the latter being the technique of choice, showed images highly suggestive of this condition. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for strict control of blood pressure and monitoring of new critical episodes. From the point of view of management, tacrolimus was withdrawn and cyclosporine was started slowly, as this was the most commonly used regimen in the literature in these cases. Mycophenolate was increased and high doses of corticotherapy were maintained until adequate therapeutic levels of calcineurin inhibitors were reached. Despite these changes, no rejection data were documented, either by ultrasound or endomyocardial biopsy. No new episodes of seizures. Progressive overall recovery, with somewhat slower recovery of visual disturbances. He was discharged 12 days after the event, neurologically asymptomatic and with control MRI, with significant improvement with respect to the previous study.  DIAGNOSIS Reversible posterior encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) probably secondary to treatment with tacrolimus. Generalised tonic-clonic seizures secondary to the above. Normofunctioning orthotopic heart transplant in a patient with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction, possible laminopathy. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly at the expense of right cavities. Signs of vascular redistribution and fluid in minor fissure. Serology: Toxoplasma, Echinococcus, Trypanosoma, Treponema pallidum, Strongyloides stercoralis, Schistosoma negative. Peripheral blood parasitaemia negative. Plasmodium IgM negative and IgG 1:80 (recent infection). Trichinella, Fasciola, Taenia negative. HIV negative. HAV IgM negative with positive total Ac. HBV: HBcAc positive, antiHBe undetermined and AntiHBs positive. Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV endomyocardial fibrosis. Severe LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF 20% and restrictive diastolic pattern. Low cardiac output. Dilated RV, hypocontractile with TAPSE of 11 mm, without clear image of apical occupation. Slight left atrial dilatation and moderate dilatation of the RA. Mild functional MR. Severe functional TR. Severe pulmonary hypertension. Slight right retroauricular pericardial effusion. Angio-CT pulmonary arteries and cardiac CT: minimal focal repletion defect in the periphery of the posterior basal segmental branch and lateral subsegmental branch of the LID, compatible with chronic PTE. Cardiomegaly with signs of right HF. Atheromatosis in aortic arch and coronary arteries. Increased fat density in the middle mediastinum not individualising the oesophageal wall, non-specific. Coronary angiography: coronary artery disease of 1 vessel. Anterior descending with critical ostial lesion, diffusely diseased vessel with borderline calibre and TIMI 2 distal flow. The apical portion is filled by homocoronary circulation from epicardial vessel coming from circumflex.  EVOLUTION Admitted to the cardiology ward for heart failure on debut, predominantly right heart failure, CF III/IV NYHA; restrictive cardiomyopathy compatible with LV endomyocardial fibrosis, with severe LV systolic dysfunction and restrictive LV filling pattern associated with dilated and dysfunctional RV with severe TR and data of pulmonary hypertension was observed on echocardiography. Depletive treatment was started with good response and progressive titration of neurohormonal treatment (bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 hours, ramipril 5 mg/24 hours, eplerenone 25 mg/24 hours). Angio-CT of the pulmonary arteries was requested with a diagnosis of chronic PTE and thoracic CT to assess the extent of endomyocardial fibrosis, with absence of endomyocardial calcification, showing coronary atheromatosis. Coronary angiography showed coronary artery disease of the anterior descending artery with critical ostial lesion, visualising a diffusely diseased vessel of borderline calibre. The patient was screened for infections as an aetiopathogenic factor of the endomyocardial fibrosis. Given the patient's characteristics, absence of angina, LV dysfunction secondary to endomyocardial fibrosis, ASA and statins were associated with the medical treatment already prescribed and the case was presented in a medical-surgical session (endomyocardial resection +/-CABG). The patient was rejected for surgery to resect masses and revascularise the LAD due to high surgical risk. Oral anticoagulation was not started due to a significant language barrier and high risk of non-compliance with treatment. During follow-up, the patient did not attend outpatient check-ups.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 60-year-old patient with a history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, COPD, left temporoparietal ischaemic stroke with no subsequent sequelae, dilated heart disease of ischaemic origin, which debuted in the form of inferolateral AMI 20 years earlier, with subsequent echocardiogram showing severely dilated left ventricle with severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 20%) secondary to inferoposterior akinesia and hypokinesia of the remaining segments, with mild mitral insufficiency, without other significant valvulopathies. It was decided to implant an ICD as primary prevention and CRT, with improvement in systolic function (LVEF 35%). The patient consulted the emergency department for dyspnoea of 4 days' duration, accompanied by cough and fever. Haemodynamically, BP 96/65 mmHg, febrile at 38°C, 02 saturation 92 % with KVM 24 %. Physical examination revealed abundant rhonchi and wheezing predominantly in right fields, with bibasal crackles, systolic murmur predominantly in mitral focus, bimalleolar oedema and jugular ingurgitation. Arterial blood gas with Fi02 of 24 % showed pH 7.476, pC02 34 mmHg, p02 59 mmHg, HCO3 24.5 mmol/L. CBC with minimal elevation of acute phase reactants (CRP 1.74 mg/dl) and leukocytosis 11910/L with neutrophilia 81 %, slightly altered renal function (creatinine 1.32 mg/dl and GFR 54 ml/min), correct ionogram. Chest X-ray with signs of vascular redistribution as well as a consolidating image in the right middle lobe, suggestive of pneumonic process. ECG in sinus rhythm 95 bpm, with ventricular rhythm stimulated by CRT. The patient was diagnosed with respiratory infection and decompensation of heart failure in a patient with chronic ischaemic heart disease in the dilated phase. Diuretic treatment and antibiotic therapy were started.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Chest X-ray: signs of vascular redistribution as well as a consolidating image in the right middle lobe, suggestive of a pneumonic process. ECG: sinus rhythm 95lpm, with ventricular rhythm stimulated by CRT. Echocardiogram on admission: LVEF 35-40 %. Severe mitral insufficiency with restriction of the posterior leaflet and probable prolapse of the anterior leaflet. Severe dilatation of left ventricle slightly-moderately hypertrophic, with moderate reduction of motility due to inferolateral and inferior akinesia. LVEF 35-40 %. Moderate left atrial dilatation. Right ventricle with preserved motility. Device lead in right cavities. Mild tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating PAPs 46 mmHg. No pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram: severe mitral insufficiency secondary to restrictive movement of the posterior leaflet and prolapse of the anterior leaflet at the level of A2 with an image of chordal rupture. Coronary angiography: right dominance. Truncus description: lesion 20% distal. Description of the anterior descending artery: long development, very calcified. Lesion 50 % to the middle tract. Circumflex description: very calcified. Lesion 30% proximal. Right coronary description: occluded proximally (since 2002). Bad distal vessel. Echocardiogram during implantation: implantation of two MitraClip (x2) at level A2 P2 segments of the mitral valve. Well positioned devices with slight residual leak (grade I/IV). Fluoroscopy: implantation of 2 MitraClip.  EVOLUTION During hospitalisation the patient shows improvement from the infectious point of view. However, his heart failure worsened and he went into cardiogenic shock, requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe mitral insufficiency, with restriction of the posterior leaflet and possible prolapse of the anterior leaflet. To better visualise the mechanism of mitral insufficiency, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which confirmed severe mitral insufficiency secondary to restrictive movement of the posterior leaflet and prolapse of the anterior leaflet at the level of A2 with an image of chordal rupture. Coronary angiography showed moderate lesions of the left coronary artery with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery, already present in previous studies. The patient had a torpid clinical evolution, with cardiogenic shock refractory to medical treatment, requiring orotracheal intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation and implantation of aortic balloon counterpulsation. The case was assessed jointly with the Cardiac Surgery and Haemodynamics team and, given the high surgical risk, MitraClip implantation was decided. The patient arrived in the haemodynamics room with inotropic support with dobutamine, aortic balloon counterpulsation, orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The procedure was guided by transesophageal echocardiography and scopy. Given the difficulty of the case, a strategy with at least 2 clips was considered from the beginning. The first clip was successfully implanted after multiple attempts, and a second, more lateral clip was subsequently implanted, thereby reducing the MR from grade 4 to 1. Subsequently, the patient had a good clinical evolution, being able to remove the counterpulsation balloon, ionotropic and ventilatory support, and was discharged haemodynamically stable with no signs of heart failure. Echocardiogram at discharge showed an estimated EF of 25-30%, MitraClip implantation (x2) at segment A2 P2 level of the mitral valve with well-positioned devices with mild residual leak (grade I/IV). Six months after discharge, the patient persists in NYHA functional class I-II, with no cardiac decompensation.  DIAGNOSIS Community-acquired right middle lobe pneumonia. Heart failure with biventricular dysfunction. Cardiogenic shock. Severe mitral insufficiency secondary to restrictive movement of the posterior leaflet and prolapse of the anterior leaflet at A2 level with chordal rupture image. Chronic ischaemic heart disease in dilated phase. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present the case of a middle-aged patient with hypertrophic sarcomeric cardiomyopathy, with symptomatic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, in whom alcohol septal ablation is proposed as a therapeutic option.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Personal history No known adverse drug reactions. No family history of interest in relation to his heart disease. Maternal aunt with a history of arterial hypertension and moderate parietal thickening of the left ventricle, deceased at 92 years of age. No history of sudden death in the family. Healthy parents, siblings and children. Smoker of 5 cigarettes/day. Consumption of 1 litre/day of beer. Arterial hypertension, altered basal glycaemia and recently diagnosed hypercholesterolemia. Antral ulcus in 2005. Tension headaches studied in Neurology. Treatment: enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg at breakfast.  Present illness A 48-year-old female patient, who began with sudden onset symptoms of palpitations, associated with a sensation of dyspnoea and chest tightness radiating to the throat, as well as cold sweat and blurred vision, attended the emergency department of her medical centre where she was documented, without any electrocardiographic record provided, a regular QRS tachycardia at 200 bpm, with a retrograde P wave inscribed in the terminal portion of the QRS, and she was referred to the Emergency Department of our hospital where she arrived in sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, and was discharged. From that day on, high blood pressure levels were detected, and she was started on the antihypertensive treatment indicated above. Apart from this episode, the patient reported worsening functional class with dyspnoea until minimal effort (NYHA functional class II-III) and chest pain that she defined as different from the previous episode, denying palpitations, presyncope or syncope. A clinical and genetic study was performed, with the results shown below.  Physical examination Good general condition at rest. No baseline dyspnoea. Preserved higher functions. Good distal perfusion. Haemodynamically stable. Blood pressure 140/70 mmHg. On auscultation, non-tachycardic rhythmic tones. Variable systolic murmur in foci of the base, not radiated. No semiology of pulmonary or systemic congestion.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, P for biauricular growth, voltage criteria for LV hypertrophy. ST underleveled with inferolateral flat T. 24-hour Holter: with average HR of 95 bpm, minimum of 52 and maximum of 152 diurnal. No ventricular tachycardia spells or atrial fibrillation were detected. Isolated atrial complexes. No significant pauses. Transthoracic echocardiography: left atrium of normal dimensions (anteroposterior dimension 37 mm; volume 30 ml/m2). Mitral valve with slightly thickened leaflets; the posterior leaflet shows a complete restriction in its closure; the anterior leaflet shows an evident anterior systolic movement, which at rest does not contact the interventricular septum; however, with Valsalva manoeuvre there is an evident contact with the septum (in addition to the free edge of the anterior leaflet, there seems to be an anterior systolic movement of the subvalvular apparatus, mainly secondary chordae tendineae dependent on it). Left ventricle of normal dimensions (end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters 41 mm and 27 mm, respectively; end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes 76 ml and 24 ml, respectively), with severely increased myocardial thickness at the basal septal and midventricular levels (septal wall 17 mm; inferolateral wall 10 mm). No segmental contractility abnormalities were observed, with ejection fraction by biplane disc method of 68%. Trivalve aortic valve, with slight fibrosclerosis, and good opening. Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) 19 mm. Aortic root at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva 31 mm, sinotubular junction 29 mm. Right ventricle of normal dimensions, with normal systolic function (TAPSE 24 mm; S ́ Tissue Doppler of the lateral tricuspid annulus 12.9 cm/s). Inferior vena cava of normal dimensions (15 mm), with inspiratory collapse greater than 50%. No pericardial effusion. Transmitral flow with E-wave pattern less than A. Pulmonary vein flow with S-wave pattern greater than D. There is an insufficiency with two jets: one caused by the anterior systolic movement of the anterior leaflet, which increases when forced inspiration or the Valsalva manoeuvre occurs, which suggests that the same occurs when the patient makes efforts; and another dependent on the restriction of the posterior leaflet (fixed) and which runs with a Coanda effect on the posterior wall of the atrium, reaching its ceiling; from a global point of view, mitral insufficiency of moderate degree (2+/3+) is quantified. As a consequence of the contact of the anterior mitral leaflet (and probably chordae) with the interventricular septum with inspiration and Valsalva manoeuvre, a systolic ejection gradient is generated at the level of the outflow tract-basal zone that reaches 90 mmHg (this gradient is not recorded at rest). Transaortic flow with peak velocity not measurable. Jet of mild tricuspid insufficiency (1+), with suboptimal Doppler recording for estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Conclusions: asymmetric septal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (maximum thickness 17 mm). Systolic ejection gradient at the level of the left ventricular outflow tract-basal zone reaches 90 mmHg with forced inspiration (no gradient at rest with gentle breathing). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: there is evidence of myocardial thickening mainly in the basal region of the myocardium, affecting the anterior septal and pure anterior segment to a greater extent. With thicknesses that in telediastolic sequences reach up to 22 mm in size. Measurements range between 22, 19 and 18.5 mm. The LV outflow tract sequences show an elongated anterior valve with partial anterior systolic motion and an obstruction to the LV outflow tract manifested by an obstructive jet, all these data support the diagnosis of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The functional analysis of the LV shows the following values: EF 84 %, systolic volume 86 ml, cardiac output 7.3 litres/minute, end-diastolic volume 102 ml and end-systolic volume 16 ml. No aortic valve and pulmonary valve regurgitation was observed. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation was observed. Minimal pericardial effusion. Late enhancement sequences revealed no clear uptake by the LV myocardium and a clear enhancement pattern typical of hypertrophic heart disease. Genetic study: positive for a mutation with clear pathogenic significance, MYBPC3 gene, encoding protein: myosin-binding protein C, cardiac-type, NP_000247.2: p.Glu542Gln/NC_000011.9: g.47364129C>G Haemodynamic report: coronary arteries without angiographically significant lesions. In the middle segment of the anterior descending artery there is an intramyocardial trajectory with systolic compression phenomenon. There is a septal branch of intermediate calibre and development (which is verified by injection of iodinated contrast and Sonovue ecopotentiator through OTW balloon) that irrigates an area of the interventricular septum suitable for ablation. In the distal segment of the septum there is a systolic compression phenomenon. A total of 1.7 ml was injected through an inflated OTW balloon with a diameter of 2 mm and a length of 8 mm. Pre-ablation gradient recording: baseline: 40 mmHg. Postextrasystolic: 90 mmHg. Post-ablation gradient recording: Baseline: 15 mmHg. Postextrasystolic: 25 mmHg Transthoracic echocardiogram-guided procedure with good outcome and no complications. Right femoral closure with angioseal.  EVOLUTION The patient, despite receiving beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor medical treatment, reported worsening of her functional class, progressive dyspnoea in recent months with episodes of orthopnoea, non-specific chest discomfort and palpitations, especially on exertion. No presyncope or syncope. With the titration of beta-blockers, good heart rate control was achieved both at rest and during the exercise test, despite which, she remained very symptomatic, especially during exercise, with no obstructive gradient at rest, with Valsalva reaching 80 mmHg. Admission was decided to start treatment with disopyramide with a very partial clinical response, with a relative reduction of the dynamic gradient to 65 mmHg. Given the persistent clinical refractory to medical treatment, more invasive management was decided, indicating alcohol septal ablation, which was performed by haemodynamics without complications associated with the procedure. Significant reduction in LVOT obstructive gradient and symptomatic improvement of the patient was documented, which has been maintained during subsequent follow-up.  DIAGNOSIS Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, with subaortic gradient in LV outflow tract, symptomatically refractory to medical treatment. Successful septal ablation with alcohol. Hypertrophic sarcomeric cardiomyopathy, with positive genetic study for the gene encoding a myosin-binding protein type C (MYBPC3). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 60-year-old woman, whose personal history included: smoker, no other cardiovascular risk factors, severe hypoacusis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation by CHA2DS2-VASC 1 and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. She was being treated with bisoprolol and had no family history of interest. The patient came to the emergency department for progressive dyspnoea on minimal effort for a week with orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. She also had palpitations without chest pain. She had no other symptoms.  Physical examination showed BP 110/65 mmHg, 150 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% at baseline, slight tachypnoea at rest without jugular ingurgitation, arrhythmic without audible murmurs on cardiac auscultation, crackles in both lung bases, with a normal abdomen on examination and malleolar oedema with fovea in the distal third of the lower limbs, with no signs of deep vein thrombosis. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF-RVR) and a chest X-ray showed signs of heart failure, and blood tests showed mild renal failure and mild anaemia. Beta-blocker treatment was started to control the heart rate and intravenous perfused furosemide was administered to achieve negative balance. An echocardiogram showed left ventricular dimensions at the upper limit of normality with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50-55%.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests on admission: leukocytes 10.8 mil/mcL, haemoglobin 11.4 g/dl, platelets 265 mil/mc, glycaemia 105 mg/dl, urea 69 mg/dl, creatinine 1.28 mg/dl, CPK 21 IU/L, sodium 133 mmol/L, potassium 4.6 mmol/L. Electrocardiogram on admission: AF at 149 beats per minute, QRS axis at -9o, with narrow QRS, no other electrocardiographic abnormalities of note. Chest X-ray: signs of pulmonary congestion, no pleural effusion with increased cardiothoracic index. Echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle with mild hypertrophy and preserved LVEF without segmental alterations of contractility. Diastolic pattern with single E wave and lateral E/E" of 12. Mitral insufficiency grade II and slight atrial dilatation. Normofunctioning trivalve aortic valve. Non dilated right chambers with mild tricuspid insufficiency with estimated PSAP of 55 mmHg. Inferior vena cava 22 mm with reduced collapse and absence of pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram in coronary unit: severely depressed LVEF with moderate dilatation of the left ventricle (82 ml/m2), mitral insufficiency grade III-IV, mild dilatation of the left atrium. Estimated PSAP of 65 mmHg. Echocardiogram after coronary unit output: non-dilated left ventricle with normal LVEF without segmental alterations of contractility. Mild mitral insufficiency without other notable alterations.  EVOLUTION On the hospital ward, heart rate control was achieved with bisoprolol and a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed normal left ventricular volumes with preserved LVEF and mild-moderate mitral insufficiency. Three days after admission, the patient presented AF-RVR again with haemodynamic instability and respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary oedema, so she was transferred to the Coronary Unit and electrical cardioversion was performed, which was ineffective after several attempts at maximum energy. Digoxin was administered and haemodynamic support was instituted with noradrenaline, orotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. A repeat echocardiogram showed dilatation and severe dysfunction of the left ventricle with moderate-severe functional mitral regurgitation. Progressively, after haemodynamic improvement, beta-blockers were introduced, achieving rate control and withdrawing haemodynamic and ventilatory support. Coronary angiography showed angiographically normal coronary arteries and she was transferred to the ward where the echocardiogram was repeated and showed recovery of LVEF and left ventricular dimensions. The patient was discharged with atrial fibrillation and controlled ventricular response and a diagnosis of tachycardiomyopathy under treatment with bisoprolol 5 mg every 12 hours and sintrom.  DIAGNOSIS Tachycardiomyopathy secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 53-year-old woman with no remarkable pathological history except for smoking 20 cigarettes/day. She attended the Emergency Department for aphasia and hypoaesthesia in the left arm that had appeared 12 hours earlier. On arrival she was haemodynamically stable. On physical examination she was in good general condition, conscious, cooperative and oriented, afebrile and eupneic. Hypoaesthesia in the right arm and aphasia. PCA: arrhythmic heart sounds, with holosystolic and panfocal diastolic murmur. Minimal crackles in both lung bases.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS The electrocardiogram showed a previously unknown atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, although he recognised that he had felt palpitations for months.  Laboratory tests showed no significant alterations. A CT scan of the brain showed no ischaemic lesions at that time and she was finally admitted to the Neurology Department with a diagnosis of transient ischaemic attack dependent on the middle cerebral artery. She had a very satisfactory evolution with a control CT scan showing a small ischaemic spot in the right parietal area, suggesting a cardioembolic cause. Since the risk of haemorrhagic transformation was low, it was decided to start anticoagulant treatment with acenocoumarol. As part of the cardioembolic source study, echocardiography was performed. The study was performed in AF with very rapid ventricular response, showing the difficulty to control the rate with beta-blocker therapy. A large mass (99 mm x 71 mm) dilating the left atrium was observed. The mass had heterogeneous echogenicity, multiple lobes and a 36 mm wide implantation pedicle. One of its lobes was interposed between the leaflets of the mitral valve, generating severe insufficiency and obstruction (with a high mean gradient 12 mmHg) and a concomitant severe insufficiency justifying the difference between mean and peak gradient 20 mmHg. In addition, he had moderate tricuspid regurgitation and severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF 30 % by Simpson).  EVOLUTION With this information the patient was presented for cardiac surgery, the most likely diagnosis being myxoma. No previous clinical manifestations classically associated with myxomas, such as weight loss or fever, were found. She only presented progressive dyspnoea, which we attributed mainly to the double mitral lesion caused by the myxoma. The myxoma was removed from the left atrium without complications. The mitral and tricuspid valves were not damaged, so mitral and tricuspid anuplasty was performed to solve the severe insufficiencies described. Pathological analysis of the atrial mass revealed a myxoma measuring 9 × 7 × 4 cm with patches of calcification and thrombi on its surface.  DIAGNOSIS Giant atrial myxoma with embolic phenomenon. Severe mitral stenosis and mitral insufficiency secondary to myxoma. Ischaemic stroke with involvement of the right MCA territory. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 84-year-old patient, with no known pharmacological allergies and a personal history of: arterial hypertension (AHT) of long evolution; diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 of 8 years of evolution, with diabetic retinopathy, in treatment with oral antidiabetics; chronic renal disease stage 4 of arteriosclerotic origin due to AHT and DM of long evolution (usual creatinine 2 mg/dl; estimated GFR CKD-EPI 29 mL/min/1.73 m2); benign prostatic hyperplasia and operated on for left inguinal herniorrhaphy.  Present illness The patient presented two episodes of syncope in the last 12 hours, with prodrome (general malaise and nausea without vomiting) and subsequent loss of consciousness lasting about 10 seconds with subsequent recovery without post-critical state. Associated sphincter relaxation. No tonic-clonic convulsions or tongue biting. The patient relates the symptoms to possible hypoglycaemia, so he has taken glucose orally without going to a medical centre. In the first episode he suffered cranioencephalic trauma with an incised-contuse wound to the scalp. After the second episode (witnessed by his relatives) he was brought to the emergency department for assessment. The patient reported epigastric pain of approximately one week's duration, episodic, unrelated to ingestion or movement, and associated with nausea. During the anamnesis, the patient presented a new episode of syncope, preceded by nausea and vegetative cortex, lasting a few seconds, with complete recovery of the level of consciousness afterwards, without subsequent confusional state.  Physical examination Vital signs: BP 120/57 mmHg. HR 80 bpm. Ta 36.5°C. SatO2 97 %. Capillary blood glucose 320. Conscious. Orientation. Normal colour. Normohydrated. Eupneic. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normal vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, normal peristalsis. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG 1 (performed in the emergency department): sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. Second-degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz 1. ST suprasystolic level in II, III, aVF with a decrease in I and aVL. ECG 2 (performed in the ED): sinus rhythm at 60 bpm. Second-degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz 1. ST elevation in II, III, aVF with a decrease in I and aV; somewhat less marked than in previous ECG. Emergency laboratory tests: troponin I 10.46 ng/ml. Myoglobin 400 ng/ml. ProBNP 10400 pg/ml. Glucose 315 mg/dl. Urea 90 mg/dl. Creatinine 2.21 mg/dl. Chlorine 102 mEq/l. Sodium 135 mEq/l. Potassium 4.8 mEq/l. Leukocytes 17,500 (15,400 neutrophils). Hb 11.9 g/dl. VCM 98. Prothrombin activity 85 %. Cranial CT scan: centred midline. Corticosubcortical atrophy according to age. Calcification of epiphysis and choroid plexus. No signs suggestive of bleeding or other significant radiological alterations. Urgent coronary angiography: left main coronary artery (LMCA): no angiographic disease. Anterior descending (AD): very severe lesion (90-95%) in the proximal segment encompassing the origin of the first diagonal, with significant disease in the middle segment. Distal bed with significant localised patchy involvement. Circumflex (CX): severe proximal disease (85-90 %). Distal bed formed by three left marginal branches, two of them with significant proximal ostial disease. Right coronary (RC): dominant. Moderate proximal and medial diffuse disease. Acute thrombotic occlusive lesion involving middle segment and first elbow, both calcified. Distal TIMI 1-2 flow. After opening it, a diffusely diseased distal segment with limited calibre was observed. Percutaneous coronary intervention: predilatation with low-pressure balloon with good results, implantation of two drug-eluting stents in tandem. Embolisation to the distal segment, treated with repeated intracoronary nitroprusside boluses and multi-segment low-pressure balloon dilatation. Contained dissection in proximal segment of most proximal stent treated with another drug-eluting stent in tandem. Good final result with TIMI 3 in the entire vessel with recovery of sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block. Transthoracic echocardiogram: normal sized left ventricle with preserved global LVEF. Akinesia of the basal and middle segments of the inferior wall and hypokinesia of the apical inferior segment. Mild diastolic dysfunction, with increased LVEDP. Mild MI. Normal aortic valve. Minimal TR with mild-moderate pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion. ECG at discharge: sinus rhythm at 67 bpm. First degree AV block. Q waves in inferior face.  EVOLUTION After the syncope presented in the anamnesis, once the patient had recovered, an ECG was performed which showed Mobitz I grade 2 AV block (AVB) with ST supralow leveling in the inferior face, so the patient was monitored with a defibrillator-monitor and an infarction code was activated with a diagnosis of STEACS in the inferior face. An urgent cranial CT scan was performed to rule out post-traumatic cranioencephalic haemorrhage and therapy was started with loading doses of double platelet antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Urgent coronary angiography was requested. While the patient was being monitored, he suffered a new syncope lasting seconds and the monitor showed transient evidence of high-grade atrioventricular block (phases of second-degree AVB type Mobitz II), which subsequently reverted to grade 2 AVB Mobitz I. Urgent coronary angiography was performed, which revealed an acute thrombotic occlusive lesion in the right coronary artery, responsible for the symptoms, and percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with the implantation of 3 drug-eluting stents after balloon dilatation. The transthoracic echocardiogram after the episode showed a left ventricle of normal size, with preserved ejection fraction and the ECG at discharge showed sinus rhythm at 67 beats per minute, first-degree atrioventricular block and Q waves in the inferior face. Given the recovery of the atrioventricular block after coronary reperfusion, pacemaker implantation was not necessary. Subsequently, the case was discussed with haemodynamics to consider revascularisation of the severe lesions of the anterior descending and circumflex arteries, and conservative treatment was decided given the absence of angina, anaemia, chronic renal disease and diffuse distal involvement of the LAD. The patient is currently being followed up in cardiology consultations, with good quality of life and absence of angina with medical treatment.  DIAGNOSIS Acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation (STEACS) inferoposterior Killip I. Right coronary artery with acute thrombotic occlusive lesion in mid-distal segment. Percutaneous coronary intervention with implantation of 3 drug-eluting stents in tandem. Grade 2 Mobitz i atrioventricular block with phases of high-grade atrioventricular block of ischaemic origin due to involvement of the right coronary artery. After revascularisation: first-degree atrioventricular block. Syncope of cardiogenic origin with cranioencephalic trauma, without acute cerebral haemorrhagic lesions. Incised-contuse scalp injury. Severe ischaemic multivessel multi-segment ischaemic heart disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Female patient aged 43 years, without CVRF or toxic habits. No medical or cardiological history, without taking regular medication.  Present illness She presented with syncope during her work activity, preceded by a feeling of dizziness and instability with rapid recovery afterwards. He began with central thoracic oppression and interscapular irradiation, haemodynamic instability, with an electrocardiogram suggestive of LMCA involvement. A chest CT scan was requested which ruled out acute aortic syndrome, the Infarction Code was activated, a loading dose was administered (ASA 300 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg) and the patient was referred to the reference hospital for urgent coronary angiography.  Physical examination (on arrival at the haemodynamics ward) Poor general condition. Conscious and oriented, generalised pallor. Tachypnoea, sweating, hypoperfused BP 60/40 mmHg, HR 120 bpm. SatO2 (with Oxiplus at 8 litres): 92 %. Afebrile. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without audible murmurs, tachycardic. Pulmonary auscultation: bilateral crackles up to midfields. Abdomen: soft, depressible, non-painful, no masses or megaliths, no signs of peritoneal irritation, no oedema or indirect signs of DVT.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG (initial): sinus rhythm, PR 0,18. Axis 60 o. ST elevation suggestive of subepicardial lesion up to 3 mm in I, avL, V5 (V6 without elevation due to probable artefact, V6 poorly positioned). Concomitant ST-segment elevation in inferior face up to 4 mm. Blood tests: cardiac markers (peak numbers) Trop I 56.39, myoglobin 300, proBNP 9500. Biochemistry: glucose 140 mg/dl, urea 24, creatinine 0.62 mg/dl, Chlorine 99 mEq/l, Na 134 mEq/l, K 4.6 mEq/l. Thyroid function: TSH 6,30. T4L 0.89. Iron metabolism: ferritin 265.9, transferrin 250, SatTf 15.4 %. Vitamin B12 and folic acid normal. Autoimmunity and coagulation studies negative. Haemogram: 25,500 leucocytes, Hb 12.2 g/dl, Hto 37.8%, 197,000 platelets. Coronary angiography: aortography: no images suggestive of acute aortic syndrome. Coronary angiography: right dominance. Left main coronary artery (LMCA): subocclusion compatible with spontaneous mid-distal dissection involving the ostium of the anterior descending (LAD) and proximal segment of the CX. Anterior descending: except ostial dissection, vessel of good calibre and development without lesions, initial flow TIMI 1-2. Cx: ostial and proximal dissection involving first marginal (Mo) of small entity. Second Mo of good development without lesions. Right coronary: no significant angiographic lesions. Percutaneous coronary interventionism: PCI on LMCA: during the procedure he presented sustained ventricular tachycardia at 160 bpm, with haemodynamic instability, which required synchronised CVE at 100 J with success. Synergy 4 x 24 mm direct drug-eluting stent was implanted in the LMCA with good results, TIMI 3 flow in the LAD, with angiographic improvement of the ostial-proximal CX. It was decided to finalise the procedure by implanting an intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation device (IABP) and noradrenaline perfusion.  Transthoracic echocardiogram (at discharge): LV slightly dilated (LVEDD 54 mm). Severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF estimated by Simpson "s 30%). Medial and apical septal akinesia and all apical segments, medial lateral (these segments being thinned). Inferoapical dyskinetic aneurysm. Medial lateral and anterior medial hypokinesia. Rest of segments contractility preserved. Pseudonormal diastolic pattern, without current data of elevated preload. Left atrium of normal dimensions. Normal right chambers, RV normocontractile. Normal aortic root and visualised portion of proximal ascending aorta. MV: thin leaflets, mild central reflux. VAo: trivalva, thin leaflets, competent. Minimal TR. IVC not dilated with inspiratory collapse. Estimated normal PAPs. Slight pericardial effusion adjacent to the right cavities, with no current signs of haemodynamic echocardiographic compromise. Intravenous contrast was administered which ruled out the presence of apical thrombus, but slow flow in the area of inferoapical aneurysm.  EVOLUTION Admitted to the coronary ICU in cardiogenic shock and acute pulmonary oedema requiring high-dose inotropic support, non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and IABP, presenting at the acute moment with SVT and haemodynamic instability requiring effective ECV. Slow and progressive clinical improvement allowed withdrawal of IABP and lowering of inotrope, with a control echocardiogram in ICU showing moderate LV dysfunction (low intravenous inotrope), with no secondary mechanical complications. During his stay on the ward, he was clinically stable, with no arrhythmic events. A repeat echocardiogram at discharge showed severe LV dysfunction, with akinesia of apical segments, inferoapical dyskinetic aneurysm, with no evidence of systemic congestion or significant valvular heart disease. She presented fair blood pressure figures that prevented treatment with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, so ivabradine was started for optimal heart rate control; double antiplatelet therapy was maintained for at least one year, eplerenone and diuretics at low doses, and she was discharged. A new control echocardiogram was performed in 40 days with no improvement in echocardiographic data, so it was decided to implant a subcutaneous ICD for primary prevention. She continued to be reviewed by the Heart Failure and Cardiac Rehabilitation Unit, with current functional class II/IV NYHA.  DIAGNOSIS Acute coronary syndrome with ST segment elevation (STEACS) anterolateral Killip IV. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of LMCA to LAD and CX. Percutaneous coronary intervention on LMCA-AD (1 drug-eluting stent). Severe LV dysfunction with contractile segmental asymmetries. Subcutaneous ICD implantation for primary prevention. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 47-year-old woman from Romania, resident in Spain for 10 years. No known drug allergies. Ex-smoker and former injecting drug user, which she gave up completely in 2000. Currently married, runs her own handicraft workshop. In 2000, the patient had suffered an episode of infective endocarditis on the tricuspid valve, which was operated on in her native country by total valve explant. There was no subsequent follow-up for years. In 2014 the first contact with cardiology in our country took place: she consulted for progressive deterioration of functional class and was diagnosed with chronic heart failure. Control echocardiograms showed progressive dilatation and severe dysfunction of the right ventricle as well as severe displacement of the interventricular septum towards the left chambers, which limited left ventricular filling. Despite the optimisation of hygienic and pharmacological measures, over the years the clinical symptoms of heart failure progressed to a situation of severe functional limitation (NYHA III-IV/IV) with dyspnoea on slight exertion, as well as the need for admission for intravenous diuretic treatment. Along the way, she also developed atrial fibrillation, with difficulty in frequency control. For all these reasons, she was referred from her centre to our hospital for evaluation of advanced therapies for heart failure. She was treated with furosemide between 40 and 80 mg per day according to self-adjustment, aldactone 100 mg per day, acenocoumarol 23 mg per week and digoxin 1 tablet per day. On admission, the patient was haemodynamically stable, with a tendency to well tolerated arterial hypotension. She presented with frank right congestion and signs of low cardiac output, including postprandial abdominal pain and marked asthenia. In addition, although the patient had not presented syncope, she reported occasional episodes of dizziness with sweating, related to exertion, especially at times of increased decompensation of heart failure. Vitals: BP 100/50 mmHg, HR 60 bpm, SatO2 97 % (without supplementary O2). On physical examination, central cyanosis. Jugular ingurgitation visible up to the earlobe with marked v-wave. Cardiac auscultation was arrhythmic, with a gallop in the right third tone, as well as a pansystolic murmur III/VI also audible from the back. Pulmonary auscultation with no significant findings. Abdomen with pulsatile hepatomegaly (visible without palpation), painful 5 finger traverses. There was no oedema in the lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 100 bpm, right inferior axis with BRD and negative T wave from V1 to V6 and in inferior leads. Chest X-ray: sternotomy suture. Voluminous global cardiomegaly with very significant enlargement of the right ventricle and left chambers. Accessory lobe and fissure of the azygos. No significant pleuropulmonary alterations. Echocardiogram: left ventricle not dilated, with normal wall thickness. Very marked systolic and diastolic bulging of the interventricular septum towards the left ventricle, predominantly diastolic. Global systolic function slightly depressed. Normal transmitral filling pattern. Interatrial septum displaced towards the left atrium. Slightly dilated left atrium. Severely dilated right atrium and right ventricle. Dysfunctional RV, with absence of tricuspid valve, functionally acting together with the RA as a single cavity. Pulmonary valve with dilatation of the annulus with insufficiency that is difficult to assess in terms of severity. Morphologically normal mitral valve. Mild insufficiency. Sclerosed aortic valve, good opening and functionally normal. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure not estimable. Inferior vena cava severely dilated, plethoric, without collapse. Severely dilated suprahepatic veins. No pericardial effusion. Aortic root not dilated.  EVOLUTION Given the semiology of right congestion, treatment was started with intravenous diuretic. The patient showed signs of low anterograde output, so he received inotropic support with dobutamine and subsequent weaning with levosimendan. Significant symptomatic improvement, although with significant difficulty in switching from depletive to oral treatment, requiring frequent appointments at the Cardiology day hospital, some of which required admission for treatment intensification. Given the evolution of the patient, it was decided to perform a pre-transplant study, for which there were no contraindications. The only incident was a personal history of hepatitis C virus (genotype 1a and high viral face) which had been treated with simeprevir and sofosbuvir, and was considered cured (prolonged sustained viral response for years) and secondary complications were ruled out by means of a complete digestive study. As a result, the patient is currently on the waiting list for elective heart transplantation.  DIAGNOSIS Right heart failure in advanced functional class (IV/IV NYHA) secondary to tricuspid valvectomy as treatment for infective endocarditis. Severe dilatation and right ventricular dysfunction. Secondary mild left ventricular dysfunction. Permanent atrial fibrillation. Cured HCV infection. Inclusion on the elective list for heart transplantation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 79-year-old male diabetic with chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as medical history of interest. In 2009, he underwent surgery for severe degenerative aortic stenosis and underwent aortic valve replacement with a Mitroflow No23 biological prosthesis. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a normofunctioning valve with a maximum gradient of 25 mmHg. During follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic until June 2016, when he presented with congestive heart failure in NYHA functional class III. The physical examination at that time highlighted RsCsRs with systolic murmur III/VI aortic with diastolic murmur II/IV. Normal abdomen. Lower limbs without oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: was in sinus rhythm at 60 bpm with left ventricular hypertrophy and normal QRS width. TTE: severe aortic insufficiency of intraprosthetic origin with a maximum aortic gradient of 32 mmHg. Left ventricular function was normal and other findings included mild mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography: coronary arteries were normal. Angio-CT: to evaluate the valve complex and vascular accesses, this test was performed with the following measurements: annulus: diameter 17 x 17.6 mm (mean 17.3 mm), circumference: 63.9 mm, circumference derived from the diameter: 20.3 mm; area: 320.9 mm2; area derived from diameter 20.2 mm; sinuses of Valsalva: left diameter 28 and height 10.7 mm, right diameter 28.8 and height 16.5 mm, non-coronary 27.2 and height 16.5 mm; height to coronary ostiums: left 4.3 mm, right 9.5 mm; LV outflow tract: diameter 18.7 x 23.2 mm. Distance from ring projection to coronary trunk exit 4.4 mm. Vascular accesses (minimum diameters): common iliac artery diameter 8 x 9.8 mm, right femoral artery diameter 7.1 x 7.2 mm, left common iliac artery diameter 7.6 x 7.7 mm, left femoral artery diameter 6.4 x 7.3 mm. Estimated risk scores STS 8 %, Euroscore 2: 14.98 %, Log Euroscore 48.25 %.  EVOLUTION With the diagnosis of late prosthetic dysfunction (Mitroflow N23) with severe intraprosthetic insufficiency, the case was discussed in a medical-surgical session and taking into account the high surgical risk, the fact that it would be a reintervention and the patient's preference, it was decided to implant the Evolut N23 TAVI through right femoral access by means of a valve-in-valve procedure. The procedure is performed by placing a guidewire in the left coronary trunk during valve implantation and coronary angiography is performed to verify complete patency of the LMCA prior to prosthesis release. Both the placement and release of the prosthesis were carried out without incident, with angiography verifying correct positioning and the absence of significant regurgitation. After the procedure, the patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours with good evolution and early extubation. He was transferred to the cardiology ward where a control TTE was performed, which showed a normofunctioning prosthesis with a maximum gradient of 33 mmHg, without insufficiency. As the patient was asymptomatic, discharge was decided on the 7th day.  DIAGNOSIS Implantation of an Evolut type transcatheter aortic prosthesis by means of a valve in valve procedure for treatment of late prosthetic degeneration (Mitroflow N23). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 60-year-old woman allergic to ASA. Ex-smoker. The only history is that she underwent hysterectomy and double adnexectomy in 2008. No cardiological history. She presented with progressive dyspnoea of one month's duration, associated with presyncopal symptoms. On the day of admission the patient suffered a syncopal episode. She was attended at home and was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and acute pulmonary oedema. She was admitted to the ICU.  On arrival at the ICU physical examination was performed: BP 105/57 mmHg, HR 160 bpm, T 36.4 oC, SatO2 89 % with Ventimask at 10 litres. Patient conscious and oriented. Tachypnoea. No jugular ingurgitation or hepatojugular reflux. Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic heart sounds at high frequency, interrupted by breath sounds. Pulmonary auscultation: bilateral crackles up to upper fields. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, no masses or megaliths palpable. Peristalsis preserved. No oedema in the lower extremities or signs of DVT.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG on arrival at ICU: atrial fibrillation 160 bpm. Chest X-ray: bilateral interstitial infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusion, compatible with acute pulmonary oedema. Blood tests on arrival in the ICU: arterial blood gases pH 7.48, pCO2 39.4, HCO3 28.8, Sat O2 90.5%, pO2 62 mmHg. Biochemistry: creatinine 0.75 mg/dl. Urea 112 mg/dl. Calcium 7.7 mg/dl. Mg 2.3 mg/dl. Total protein 5.1 g/dl. Cl 112 mEq/l. Na 148 mEq/L. K 4.6 mEq/L. Haemogram: 15,000 leucocytes/uL with 88.3 % neutrophils and 6.1 % lymphocytes. Haemoglobin 9.6 g/dl. Hto 31.2 %. Platelets 211,000/uL. Coagulation: INR 1,36. Prothrombin activity 68 %, TTP 60 s, PT 15.20 s. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram: LV neither dilated nor hypertrophic. Preserved LVEF (estimated by Simspon 60 %). Left atrium slightly dilated (area 22 cm2). Left atrial appendage free of thrombus. RV of normal size and systolic function (TAPSE 23 mm, S wave by lateral TDI 10.5 cm/s). A large mass (7 x 3 cm) with slightly irregular borders and homogeneous density was observed in the left atrium. It is attached to the interatrial septum, prolapsing in diastole through the mitral valve and generating moderate restriction to its opening (mean transmitral gradient 7.5 mmHg). Mild MI. Given the echocardiographic characteristics, it appears to be a cardiac myxoma, without being able to rule out malignancy. Atrial septum of normal echocardiographic characteristics without flow through it. Aortic valve: trivalve with normal kinetics, no restriction to its opening, no reflux. Tricuspid valve: Mild TR. RV-AD gradient of 29 mmHg. IVC and suprahepatic valves not dilated, no flow reversal and inspiratory non-collapse. Estimated PAPs of 33 mmHg. Absence of pericardial effusion. Aortic root, ascending and descending thoracic aorta of normal size and echoic characteristics. Cardio-MRI: study by means of TI, T2, STIR sequences in axial, 2C, 3C, 4C and by means of iv contrast (angio-MRI) and late enhancement sequence in 2C and 4C. Voluminous mobile tumour in the left atrial cavity measuring 7 x 4.5 cm extending to the posteroinferior region of the left atrium. It presents a pedicle with a base of implantation in the interatrial septum of approximately 2 cm, in the middle third of the septum (proximity of the fossa ovalis) with slightly mameloned contours, with part of the mass prolapsing through the mitral valve in early diastole. It presents intermediate intensity in T1 that increases in T2. After contrast administration, it appears irregularly perfused, as well as with heterogeneous uptake in late gadolinium enhancement sequence. Given the presentation and behaviour in the different sequences, the mass is compatible with a sarcomatous strain. Cardiac catheterisation: coronary arteries without angiographic lesions.  EVOLUTION After performing complementary tests and given the clinical situation of the patient, urgent surgery was decided. Under extracorporeal circulation (ECC), a voluminous tumour infiltrating the atrioventricular groove and the interatrial septum was resected, with the appearance of malignancy. Mitral valve replacement with a metallic prosthesis and closure of the septal defect with pericardium were performed. During the first 72-96 postoperative hours, the patient remained under deep sedoanalgesia due to severe refractory hypotension, in the context of post-ACS inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS); requiring vigorous volume expansion, as well as high doses of noradrenaline (NA) and vasopressin in continuous perfusion, associating continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) at maximum doses of ultrafiltration due to incipient acute renal failure (ARF). Once the vasoplegia had resolved, sedation could be withdrawn and weaning from mechanical ventilation could be initiated. The patient could be extubated with normal level of consciousness, initially maintaining good respiratory mechanics with O2 Sat > 95% with oxygen therapy at medium flows. However, respiratory mechanics progressively worsened. A TTE was performed which ruled out cardiological complications with a normally functioning prosthesis; and a chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrate compatible with ARDS, requiring reintubation. The evolution was torpid, with exitus 7 days after the cardiac postoperative period. Finally, the anatomopathological diagnosis was high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma.  DIAGNOSIS High-grade cardiac pleomorphic sarcoma in the left atrium. Acute heart failure due to obstruction to left ventricular filling. Urgent surgery for tumour resection and mechanical mitral prosthesis. Poor postoperative evolution with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and exitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient is a 27-year-old male from Ukraine. He was evaluated in his country for long PR in 2012, with PR 260 ms, with sinus bradycardia at 52 bpm at rest. He had a normal echocardiogram, with no structural abnormalities. He does not take regular medication. There is no family history of cardiological disease or sudden death. He frequently practises sport. For more than a year she has reported occasional dizziness and unsteadiness, mainly after exercise, without loss of consciousness. Approximately 5 years ago, a syncopal episode in Ukraine, in the context of a fever of more than 40°C, she reports being aware of losing consciousness, without trauma, she reports that she may have noticed palpitations, without confirming this. In subsequent years she has not had any syncopal or pre-syncopal episodes, even though she has had other febrile processes. A few months ago she consulted MAP and was referred to the cardiologist for bradycardia. An ECG was performed in the consultation room showing complete AV block with escape rhythm at 40 bpm, narrow QRS, QTc 490 ms, and he was referred to the emergency department for admission and examination. Physical examination: BP 139/60 mmHg; HR 45 bpm; SatO2 100% baseline. Eupneic. No IY. AC: rhythmic heart tones, no audible pathological murmurs. AP: bilateral normoventilation. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, no signs of peritoneal irritation, no megaliths. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of DVT.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: no alterations of interest. Chest X-ray: compatible with normality. Autoimmunity: negative. Borrelia burgdorferi serology: negative. Echocardiogram: compatible with normality, non-dilated left ventricle and normal LVEF. Stress echocardiogram: to assess tachycardia: ergometry: BRUCE protocol. Test suspended due to physical fatigue. No dyspnoea or angina. Functional capacity preserved: 22.2 METS. Basal ECG sinus rhythm at 48 bpm, without repolarisation alterations; no changes on exertion. No arrhythmias from the first stage BAVc disappears, long PR with excellent tachycardia reaching a maximum HR of 181 bpm (93% of the FCMT). Adequate behaviour in the post-exercise phase. BAVc reappears at rest, when HR decreases to less than 80x". Basal BP 130/80 mmHg. Correct behaviour with effort. Post-effort echocardiogram: no alterations in segmental contractility. No changes in valvular flows, diastolic pattern or PAP. ID: No induction of myocardial ischaemia. Good functional capacity. Excellent tachycardialisation from the first Bruce stage. Electrophysiological study: baseline ECG shows sinus rhythm with 2nd degree BAV Mobitz I type. Double puncture of the right femoral vein (5F introducer). Conduction intervals: HV 40 ms. Basally and under atrial stimulation, the suprahisian origin of the AV block was confirmed. The procedure was terminated without complications. Interpretation and conclusions: electrophysiological study compatible with supra-Hisian AVB.  EVOLUTION Asymptomatic during admission, denies dizziness. No syncopal or presyncopal episodes. He was monitored throughout admission, maintaining grade 2 AVB, with HR between 30 and 50 bpm, asymptomatic. A transthoracic echocardiogram ruled out structural heart disease. The case was discussed with the Arrhythmia Unit and ergometry was performed, which was normal, with excellent tachycardia on exertion. An electrophysiological study was performed, compatible with supra-Hisian AVB, and given the chronotropic competence, it was decided to recommend a reduction in physical activity and a review in 3 months.  DIAGNOSIS Suprahisian atrioventricular supra-Hisian block. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History No known allergies. Several episodes of rheumatic fever.  Present illness A 15-year-old male patient from Malawi presented with moderate exertional dyspnoea for years, associated with asthenia, orthopnoea and some episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, with progressive worsening of his functional class, up to dyspnoea on slight exertion. He was assessed by doctors in his home country, where he was diagnosed with severe mitral stenosis, mild mitral insufficiency, severe tricuspid insufficiency and severe pulmonary hypertension. Due to clinical worsening and the impossibility of adequate treatment in his place of origin, he was transferred to Spain by an NGO for the corresponding surgical treatment. After the transfer, the patient presented deterioration of his usual dyspnoea with dyspnoea at rest, concomitant abdominal pain in both hypochondria, dyspepsia and several episodes of emesis after food intake, so it was decided to admit him to the Paediatrics Department to optimise depletive treatment prior to surgical treatment.  Physical examination Weight: 27 kg BP: 90/60 mmHg, HR: 90 bpm, SO2: 100 % with O2. Neck: jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: R1 and R2 rhythmic and regular. Intense systolic-diastolic murmur in mitral focus radiating towards the axillary region. Pulmonary auscultation: bibasal hypoventilation, more marked in the right base. Abdomen: hepatomegaly 4 traveses, slightly painful on palpation in the right and left hypochondrium. Splenomegaly. Extremities: symmetrical, without oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: haemogram: leucocytes 11,600 /ul. Neutrophils 82.4 %. Monocytes 9.8 %. Lymphocytes 7.2 %. Hb 11 g/dl. Ht 33.5 %. Platelets 106.000 /ul. Biochemistry: glucose 120 mg/dl, urea 34 mg/dl, creatinine 0.5 mg/dl, Na 135 mEq/L, K 3.9 mEq/L. ECG: RS at 92 bpm, p wave of biatrial growth, incomplete BRD + HBPII, signs of hypertrophy and growth of right cavities, Axis deviated to the right, ST descent of 1 mm in V3-V5. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly at the expense of the right chambers, fluid in cystole.  Transthoracic echocardiogram: situs solidus, levocardia with levoápex. LVEF 65 %. Right chambers severely dilated. RV with preserved contractility. Severe TR due to lack of coaptation of the leaflets by annular dilatation, AD-VD gradient of 60 mmHg. PAPs 70-75mmHg. Mitral valve: thickened anterior leaflet, domed opening and anterior displacement of the posterior leaflet, fused commissures, mean transmitral gradient of 16 mmHg, area by planimetry of 4 mm and by THP of 0.75 cm2. Mild MI. Dilated IVC. Slight pericardial effusion.  EVOLUTION After stabilisation of congestive heart failure, with adequate response to depletive treatment, given contraindication to treatment with balloon valvuloplasty due to great valve deconstruction, surgical treatment was performed with replacement of the mitral valve with a biological prosthesis, plus tricuspid annuloplasty. In the initial postoperative phase, he required vasoactive drugs and pulmonary vasodilators due to a drop in BP and oliguria, with haemodynamic stabilisation after 24 hours. He was transferred to the paediatric ward from where he was discharged on the eighth day. Postoperative echocardiographic control showed a normofunctioning bioprosthesis, with mean gradient of 3 mmHg, maximum E wave of 15 mmHg, normofunctioning LV, no pericardial effusion, mild TR.  DIAGNOSIS Rheumatic severe mitral stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation. Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension. Congestive heart failure. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A 15-year-old male patient with no known pathological history came to the emergency department with epigastralgia, anorexia, weight loss and asthenia of one month's duration, with slight swelling of the lower limbs. No fever or other associated symptoms, no chest pain. The anamnesis revealed that he had been practising sport regularly until 2 months ago, when he began to experience fatigue that forced him to reduce his exercise load, nausea with abdominal pain, and loss of up to 6 kg in the last two months.  Physical examination BP 96/61 mmHg, HR 120 bpm, RR 24 rmp, Sat 95%. Regular general condition, tachypneic, afebrile, hydrated. Neurological: no pathological findings.  Cardiorespiratory: rhythmic heart tones, systolic murmur II/VI in mitral focus. Bibasal crackles. Positive hepatojugular reflux. Abdomen: hepatomegaly of 2 fingers under the costal ridge. Pain on palpation in the epigastrium. Extremities: peripheral pulses present and symmetrical. Minimal bimalleolar oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Emergency analytical tests: Hb 12.6 g/d. Leukocytes 14,000 u/L. Cr 1.37 mg/d. Urea 69 mg/dl. GOT 1145 U/L. GTP 1590 U/L. TnTUs 1,722 pg/ml. Venous blood gas Ph 7.44, PCO2 35 mmHg. HCO3 26 mmol/L. Lactate 2,4 mmol/L. ECG on arrival: sinus tachycardia at 115 bpm, normal PR narrow QRS with inverted T wave on lateral side. Echocardiogram: dilated left ventricle (DTD 59 mm) with thinned walls. Severely depressed systolic function at the expense of global hypokinesia, LVEF 19%. Moderate MI of functional profile. Trivalve aortic valve with normal transvalvular gradients. RV slightly dilated, with TAPSE of 9 mm. Trivial TR allowing estimation of PAPs of 45 mmHg. Slight pericardial effusion. IVC of 19 mm with little inspiratory collapse. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): dilated left ventricle (LVEDV 139 ml/m2) with decreased wall thickness, and very severe depression of ventricular function, LVEF 14%. Right ventricle with slightly increased volumes (RVOTV115 ml/m2) and severely decreased systolic function, RVEF 22%. Absence of oedema in STIR sequences. First-pass perfusion (dimeglumine gadobenate) at rest normal. Late multifocal contrast uptake, intramyocardial and epicardial, circumferential throughout the LV. In conclusion DCM with very severe depression of biventricular function secondary to extensive myocardial fibrosis.  EVOLUTION After initial examinations in the emergency department and bedside echocardiography, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further study and treatment, where CMR was requested, confirming the echocardiographic findings, showing no myocardial oedema and extensive fibrosis with absence of viability. In view of these results, and with the suspicion of possible evolved myocarditis, under optimal medical treatment, which included ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, loop diuretics and antialdosterone drugs, the referral hospital was contacted to assess cardiac transplantation. Simultaneously, the patient presented progressive haemodynamic deterioration, with symptoms of persistent heart failure, increased lactate and other signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, so vasoactive drugs were started, which were regularly tolerated, with episodes of SMVT from the start of treatment, as well as levosimendan perfusion, without satisfactory response, so a Levitronix Centrimag type ventricular assist device was implanted via the left subclavian artery, pending cardiac transplantation. Finally, orthotopic transplantation was performed using the bicava technique, with adequate graft functioning during the postoperative period. Extubated during the first 24 hours after surgery. Post-transplant echocardiogram showed good LV function (LVEF 66%), slightly decreased TAPSE (15 mm), absence of valve disease and minimal pericardial effusion. Currently, 6 months post-transplant, the patient has remained asymptomatic, since discharge with immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, atorvastatin and valganciclovir (after detection of CMV+ in controls). Coronary angiography with OCT showed no intimal proliferation, and endomyocardial biopsies showed no rejection.  DIAGNOSIS Non-ischemic DCM, with very severe depression of biventricular function. Cardiogenic shock. Cardiac transplantation. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION We present the case of a 42-year-old female patient, active smoker as the only cardiovascular risk factor (15 cigarettes/day since adolescence), with no personal or family cardiological history prior to this event. On the night of admission, at around 21:00 hours and at rest at home, she began with oppressive central thoracic pain, discomfort in the left upper limb and marked vegetative cortex (emesis, diaphoresis and persistent nausea). Half an hour after the onset of the symptoms, she decided to call 061 who, on arrival at her home, performed an electrocardiogram showing ST elevation in the anterior face. In view of these findings, the haemodynamics department was contacted and the patient was transferred to our hospital for emergency coronary angiography. Coronary angiography was performed, showing dissection of the LAD from its proximal segment along its entire length with initial TIMI 2 flow (dominant RCA and RCA without lesions). After successive contrast injections, the flow in the LAD and diagonal improved, and conservative management was chosen. The patient was transferred to a monitored unit in Cardiology to continue her evolution. On arrival the patient was haemodynamically stable: BP 110/60, HR 80 bpm, SatO2 98% with nasal goggles at 2 l/min. Afebrile. Physical examination was unremarkable with no systemic/pulmonary congestive semiology or low output. Clinically, she persisted with slight retrosternal discomfort that gradually disappeared in the hours following catheterisation.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: glucose 106 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.51 mg/dl. Urea 24 mg/dl. Sodium 142 mEq/l. Potassium 4.4 mEq/litre. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 146 mg/dl. LDL-Col 37 mg/dl. LDL-Col 88 mg/dl. Triglycerides 106 mg/dl. Normal liver and thyroid profile. Glycated Hb 5.2%. Peak TNTUs 9613 ng/dl. Peak CPK 3219 mg/dl. Rheumatoid factor, CRP, ESR, ESR, proteinogram, complement, ACE, microalbumimuria and normal hormonal study. Initial leukocytosis (predominance of polymorphonuclear cells) which subsequently normalised. Hb 14 g/dl. Platelets 349,000. ANA and ANCA negative. Electrocardiograms: 061: sinus rhythm at 80 bpm. Normal axis normal PR normal. Narrow QRS with minimal R to V4 with ST elevation from V2-V6 (up to 4 mm in V4). Minimal lateral upstroke and ST rectified in AvR. At discharge: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm. Normal axis. Normal PR. Narrow QSR with QS from V1-V4. Flattened T waves in frontal plane leads. Catheterisation: left coronary trunk without lesions. Anterior descending artery with dissection from the proximal segment affecting its entire course. Double descending-diagonal system. Initial TIMI 2 flow. Circumflex artery without lesions. Dominant right coronary artery without lesions. Successive injections of contrast were repeated with improved flow in the LAD and diagonal, so conservative management was adopted. Echocardiography at discharge: LA of normal size (27 mm, 29 ml/m2). Normal mitral valve. LV: DTD 48 mm, VTD 107 ml, VTDi 71 ml/m2. EF by Simpson biplane 36%. Akinesia of the apical half of all walls. No mural thrombus seen. Septum 9 mm and inferolateral wall 7 mm. Mitral E 46 cm/sec and A 56 cm/sec. Normal aortic valve. Sinuses of Valsalva 32 mm. Non dilated right chambers with good RV systolic function. Mild TR with normal estimated PAPS. Non dilated IVC with inspiratory collapse > 50%. No pericardial effusion (Video 3-6). Angio-CT of renal arteries (conclusions): kidneys without abnormalities. No evidence of renal stenosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. Double left renal artery and fine calibre supernumerary artery in the right kidney. Ergometry at the beginning and end of CRP: clinical and electrical negatives for the level of effort reached. Adequate blood pressure response in both. No arrhythmic events. Start-final functional capacity (10-13 METS), start-final exercise time (9 min-12 min) and start-final heart rate recovery rate (17 bpm-30 bpm).  EVOLUTION Once the diagnosis was known, the patient was re-historised, orienting the anamnesis towards the search for risk factors related to this entity. The patient was an active smoker, smoking having been related to this pathology (by facilitating endothelial damage). She had previously taken oral contraceptives and had been using an intrauterine device (IUD) as a contraceptive measure for two years. The pregnancy test performed during admission was negative. She did not remember having exercised more than usual during the previous days. She did report emotional stress the previous week in relation to her daughters' school problems. She had no symptoms compatible with connective, autoimmune, rheumatological or systemic inflammatory diseases. A blood test was performed with a lipid, thyroid and liver profile with no notable alterations. An autoimmunity study was requested (rheumatoid factor, CRP, ESR, immunogluilins, complement, ACE, hormonal study and antiphospholipid antibodies), which were normal. Angio-CT of the renal arteries was negative for renal stenosis and showed no data suggesting fibromuscular dysplasia. The patient presented a favourable clinical evolution during her admission. Echocardiography showed akinesia of the entire apical territory (without mural thrombus) and the ejection fraction (EF) was moderately depressed (Simpson biplane 36%). After clinical improvement and optimisation of medical treatment she was discharged home with double antiplatelet therapy.  The patient was referred to the cardiac rehabilitation programme (CRP) of our hospital, and was included in the high-risk group (20 sessions). She completed the programme without incident and with good adherence. Prognostic ergometry showed improvement in functional capacity (10-13 METS), exercise time (9 min-12 min) and heart rate recovery rate (17 bpm-30 bpm). Echocardiography at the end of the programme showed improvement in EF, with mild dysfunction (LVEF 49%). Finally, he has been periodically reviewed by Internal Medicine, which establishes that at the present time there are no clinical-biological data of autoimmune disease or phenotype-data of collagenopathy.  DIAGNOSIS Anterior STEACS secondary to spontaneous coronary artery dissection of LAD. Akinesia of apical segments with moderate LV dysfunction at discharge (LVEF 36%). Negative autoimmunity/collagenopathy study. Completion of cardiac rehabilitation programme with improvement in functional capacity and partial recovery of LVEF (after CRP 49%). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Oximetry: SVC 63 %, RV 65 %, PA 63 %, LV 96 %, Ao 96 %. CO (Fick) 2.5 l/min. IC (Fick) 1.8 l/min. PVR 2 UW. Indexed PVR 2.7 UW.m2 SVR: 29 UW. Coronary angiography: normal coronary arteries. Pericardial calcification predominantly at the apico-inferior level. Conclusion: high and equal right and left end-diastolic pressures. Dip-plateau pressure in both ventricles. No reciprocal respiratory changes, which is suggestive of predominant myocardial restriction. Ergospirometry: performed on a cycle ergometer with a power increase of 15 W/min. Duration of effort 5 ́10". Peak O2 consumption 14.7 ml/kg/min (predicted 36.2 ml/kg/min). Ventilatory CO2 equivalent 25.0. Anaerobic threshold 7.9 ml/kg/min. Functional grade III. O2 consumption is 41% of its theoretical value. Cardiac CT: Agatston score 0. Epicardial coronary arteries without lesions. Intense concentric calcification of the pericardium with severe involvement of the free wall of the right ventricle, diaphragmatic face of both ventricles and isolated foci and lateral face of the left ventricle. There are also areas of calcification in front of the root of the great vessels. The greatest calcification is at the level of the free wall of the right ventricle with thicknesses between 5 and 10 mm. Aneurysmal inferior vena cava with a diameter of 60 x 57 mm. Dilatation of suprahepatic veins. Ventricular cavities apparently of normal size. At the level of the apex of the right ventricle within the thickness of the pericardial fat there is an area of contrast extravasation of 10 x 9 mm which could be a pseudoaneurysm of the right ventricular apex. Aneurysm of the interatrial septum. Severe dilatation of the left atrium and moderate dilatation of the right atrium. Pulmonary parenchyma without significant alterations. Cardiac MRI: left ventricular ejection fraction 66%. Concentric calcified thickening of the pericardium being more important at the level of the free wall of the right ventricle. Dilatation of both atria. Aneurysm of the interatrial septum. Normal global and segmental contractility of the left ventricle. Dyskinetic movement of the interventricular septum. Good right ventricular function. Small pericardial effusion in inferior aspect. In the late enhancement sequences no pathological uptakes were observed.  EVOLUTION A 32-year-old woman with a diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy was admitted due to worsening heart failure despite outpatient intensification of diuretics. During admission, a new echocardiogram was performed, which showed data compatible with myocardial restriction, although with signs suggestive of a constrictive component. To better characterise the restrictive and constrictive components, a CT scan and cardiac MRI were performed, which showed intense calcification of the pericardium, especially at the RV level with myocardial infiltration at that level, and preserved biventricular function without pathological enhancements. The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis was therefore confirmed, probably in relation to the history of acute myopericarditis in adolescence. She improved clinically and was discharged with the following treatment: seguril 2-1-0, aldactone 25 mg 1-2-0; boi-k 1-1-1.  Subsequently, an outpatient haemodynamic study was also performed, with epicardial coronary arteries without significant lesions, and right catheterisation showing: increased and equalised right and left end-diastolic pressures, with no reciprocal respiratory changes. The catheterisation data suggested a predominance of myocardial restriction, but given the findings in the imaging tests, it was decided to present the patient for a medical-surgical session to consider pericardiectomy, which was finally rejected due to intense intramyocardial calcification, anatomically limiting the possibilities of a complete pericardial resection surgery. Given the poor clinical evolution with the need for increased diuretics and the impossibility of pericardiectomy, it was decided to refer the patient to a heart transplant centre. She had given up smoking and was being treated with furosemide 40 mg 4 tablets a day, aldactone 100 mg a day, hygrotona 25 mg a day and potassium 2 tablets every 8 hours. She had an episode of atrial fibrillation, and was started on anticoagulation with acenocoumarol and frequency control with bisoprolol 5 mg per day. After completing the pre-transplant study, she has no contraindications and is currently on the waiting list.  DIAGNOSIS Constrictive pericarditis with myocardial restriction component due to myocardial infiltration. Heart failure in functional class iii, on the heart transplant list. Persistent atrial fibrillation, with heart rate control. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Severe LVH with no obstruction. Normal right chambers. Normal aortic and mitral valve. Restrictive diastolic pattern.   Current illness The patient was admitted to a regional hospital for presenting in the last 5 days with a general malaise associated with repeated nausea and vomiting. No fever was reported. Oral rehydration and antiemetic treatment was started without improvement. Subsequently, she developed hyporexia with minimal food intake, generalised weakness and a severe dry cough. On arrival at the regional hospital, the patient reported abdominal pain that was difficult to locate and an electrocardiogram was performed showing signs of left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarisation alterations and blood tests showed elevated markers of cardiac necrosis. With this finding, the patient was transferred to our hospital for urgent assessment by Cardiology. In our first assessment, the patient was in poor general condition, with a difficult anamnesis due to lack of cooperation. He reported no chest pain, only cough and abdominal discomfort. At rest the patient had slight dyspnoea, with no increase in the work of breathing.  Physical examination Vital signs: BP 93/56, HR 125 bpm, O2 saturation 97% with FIO2 of 24%, Temperature 36.5°C. Patient conscious and oriented. Neurological examination limited by underlying disease and by the patient being in dorsal decubitus, however, no changes with respect to previous state, no focality. Neck without jugular ingurgitation. Pulmonary auscultation with hypoventilation and crackles at the base of the lung fields. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic sounds, third heart tone, no pericardial friction. Abdomen soft, slightly painful on palpation. Hepatomegaly of 2 cm below the right costal margin is palpated. Lower extremities without oedema or signs of thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood tests: biochemistry: glucose 75 mg/dl. Urea 29 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.73 mg/dl. Sodium 136 mEq/l. Potassium 4,4 mEq/l. Total bilirubin 4,86. Direct bilirubin 0,82. Normal liver profile. CRP 6.24. Procalcitonin 0.10. Troponin I 0.4 ng/ml (0.02-0.04). Myoglobin 31,8. ProBNP 2523 pg/dl. LDH 470. Normal reticulocytes.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) in the ED: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm. Signs of LVH with secondary alterations of reporalisation. No changes with respect to previous ones. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, signs of pulmonary vascular congestion. No consolidative foci. Abdominal ultrasound: enlarged liver with increased hyperrenfraction. Dilatation of suprahepatic veins and inferior vena cava system. No focal lesions were identified. Gallbladder without lithiasis. No dilatation of the bile duct. Portion of the pancreas visualised without alterations. Spleen of normal size. Abdominal aorta of normal calibre. Kidneys with good corticomedullary differentiation. No excretory tract ectasia. No intraperitoneal free fluid is observed. Emergency transthoracic echocardiogram: LV of normal size. Severe LVH, with maximum IVS thickness of 29 mm at mid level, with hyper-refringent appearance. No obstructive gradient. Global LV systolic function severely depressed, global hypocontractility with LVEF around 29% by Teihzold method. Right ventricle of normal size, severely hypocontractile (TAPSE 8 mm). Mitral valve with normal opening, mild reflux. Aortic valve with normal structure, mild insufficiency. Moderate tricuspid insufficiency with RV/AD gradient of 20 mmHg. Dilated inferior vena cava (IVC), diameter 24 mm, without inspiratory collapse, dilated suprahepatic veins, signs of hepatic congestion. PAPS 40 mmHg. Conclusions: Severe HCM. Severe biventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild PHT. Footnotes to image/video.  EVOLUTION The patient presented in the ED in poor general condition with clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure predominantly on the right with evidence of hepatic congestion on abdominal ultrasound findings and alteration of liver markers in AS. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed in the emergency department showing severe biventricular systolic dysfunction not present in previous studies. There was also evidence of hyperreflective myocardial thickening. On suspicion of acute myocarditis with severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, treatment was started with intravenous diuretics associated with dobutamine and the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. The patient presented progressive deterioration with signs of cardiogenic shock despite the prescribed treatment. Continuous diuretic and inotropic perfusion was maintained and intravenous corticosteroids were started. No endomyocardial biopsy or cardiac MRI was performed at this time as they were not available urgently in our centre. Control echocardiography was performed at the bedside, showing severe biventricular failure with LVEF estimated at 15% and severe PHT. Given that the patient persisted with cardiogenic shock, aortic balloon counterpulsation (CABG) was implanted without improvement. The case was discussed with the Heart Failure Unit and was rejected for cardiac transplantation due to severe neurological disease, and ECMO implantation was decided as a bridge to possible recovery. The patient presented with ischaemia in the left lower limb and hypoperfusion of the right limb secondary to BACP implantation. While waiting for ECMO implantation, the patient had a torpid evolution with cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure with anuria and severe lactic acidosis that prevented intervention, presenting cardiac arrest due to asystole without recovery of spontaneous circulation despite advanced CPR. Exit due to fulminant myocarditis with refractory cardiogenic shock was certified.  DIAGNOSIS Fulminant myocarditis. Cardiogenic shock. Non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Friedreich's ataxia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 76-year-old man, retired miner and ex-smoker of half a packet a day, with added CVRFs such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and hyperuricaemia. Stroke of ischaemic origin 6 years ago without sequelae, of probable atherothrombotic as well as cardioembolic aetiology due to critical stenosis of the right carotid artery which required bypass and now permanent AF not previously diagnosed and for which he had to start oral anticoagulation therapy. Since then, he has been admitted several times for episodes of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding of very poor control. On regular treatment with furosemide, bisoprolol, ramipril, tamsulosin, allopurinol and sintrom. Admitted to a regional hospital for cough, whitish expectoration and progressive dyspnoea of a week's evolution until becoming minimal effort associated with the appearance of oedema in the lower limbs.  On arrival at the Emergency Department, he presented with a BP of 126/70 and a temperature of 36.9°C. Eupneic at 45o with O2 at 2 bpm. Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed arrhythmic heart sounds without murmurs at 76 bpm and hypoventilation in the left lung base. He also had oedema with fovea in the lower limbs, up to the middle third.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS CBC: Hb 11.5, Ht 36%, leukocytes 4,000 (normal formula), platelets 103,000, PT 12.9%, INR 5.5, renal, hepatic and ion profile normal. ABG: pH 7.47, pO2 56, pCO2 34, HCO3 25, SatO2 91 %. Chest X-ray: global cardiomegaly, signs of vascular redistribution, fluid in cystole, left pleural effusion. ECG: AF at 75 bpm, narrow QRS at 0o, meets Cornell and Sokolov criteria for LVH and signs of LV overload. TTE: dilated LV (Dtd 58 mm) with mild concentric hypertrophy and moderate left ventricular dysfunction at the expense of generalised hypokinesia. Elevation of filling pressures. Mildly dilated RV with mild ventricular dysfunction. Dilated LA (31 cm2). Significant moderate bicommissural MR III/IV at the expense of at least two jets; dilatation of Carpentier's type I annulus. Moderate TR III/IV. Severe PHT at rest. Pericardial effusion without signs of haemodynamic compromise. Haemodynamic study: severely dilated LV (indexed VTD 116 ml/m2), with severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 30%) at the expense of diffuse hypokinesia. Severe MI. Mild PHT (PAPs 42 mmHg, PAPm 25 mmHg, PCPm 16 mmHg). Coronary arteries with calcifications without angiographically significant stenosis.  EVOLUTION The patient was treated with diuretics, resolving the episode of decompensated heart failure and in view of the findings, now haemodynamically stable, he was transferred to our centre for left and right heart catheterisation with the results described above.  The patient was referred to the monographic consultation for structural heart disease at our centre where he was profiled as a candidate for MitraClip device implantation and concomitant closure of the left atrial appendage given his high haemorrhagic (HAS-BLED = 5) and thromboembolic (CHADS-VASc = 7) risk, and the intervention was scheduled for one month later, following a favourable preoperative assessment (ASA III). Throughout this period the patient persisted in functional class II, and continued with two-pillow orthopnoea and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. The MitraClip device was implanted in A3P3 position, achieving an improvement in cardiac output and a reduction in mitral insufficiency from 4+ to 0.5+. Subsequently, in the same procedure, a Watchman device was implanted to close the 27 mm left atrial appendage with adequate sealing. During the intervention, the patient presented a fall in AF with low TAS figures and required electrical cardioversion, leaving in sinus rhythm. He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit and a control TEE was performed which showed correct placement of the device with a slight residual MR due to two lateral jets to the clip and with an average gradient of 2 mmHg, slight TR, PAPs of 35 mmHg and LVEF in the lower limits of normality. During his stay in the unit there were no incidents, so he was transferred to the ward and three days after the operation he was discharged, and it was decided to suspend oral anticoagulation with sintrom and to start treatment with apixaban 2.5 mg/12 hours. Currently, the patient continues to attend the structural heart disease consultation for device control, presenting a clear improvement in his symptoms and his functional class (NYHA I) and not having presented any more episodes of upper or lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage.  DIAGNOSIS Dilated cardiomyopathy with biventricular dysfunction of non-ischaemic aetiology. ACC/AHA stage C decompensated heart failure in NYHA functional class II. Functional Mitral Insufficiency III/IV Severe PHT. MitraClip device implantation. Percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION In May 2017, an 84-year-old man was admitted to the Cardiology Department of the CAULE due to syncope. His personal history included long-standing hypertension under treatment, dyslipidaemia, and chronic kidney disease being monitored by Nephrology. He denies drug allergies and previous cardiological history. On regular antihypertensive treatment with torasemide 10 (1-0-0). He came to the Emergency Department of our hospital due to a syncopal episode on the night of admission, while sitting, with a slight sensation of blurred vision beforehand, and fell to the floor. Complete recovery within seconds. Subsequently presented with dizziness lasting 20 minutes. He denied chest pain or other accompanying symptoms. He reported increased dyspnoea with moderate exertion in the previous days.  Physical examination showed: BP 130/89, baseline SATO2 94%, HR 103 bpm, AC: arrhythmic at 110 bpm, systolic murmur in aortic focus II/VI with 2nd noise preserved. AP: bibasal crackles. Lower extremities without oedema, positive and symmetrical peripheral pulses.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: AF at 115 bpm, narrow QRS with negative T wave from V4 to V6, II, III and aVF. CBC: leukocytes 4,700 (87 % neutrophils), haemoglobin 1.3, haematocrit 34.4 %, platelets 383,000, prothrombin rate 83 %, INR 1.1, glucose 163, urea 74, creatinine 1.38, glomerular filtration rate 49, Na 141, K 4.4, Cl 104, Nt-proBNP 9233. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, bilateral interstitial pattern, free costophrenic sinuses. Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV with severe hypertrophy, non-dilated with apical akinesia with preserved global systolic function. Elevated filling pressures. Moderate LA and mild RA dilatation (suggesting cardiac amyloidosis). Mild mitral insufficiency. Aortic sclerosis without significant gradient and mild insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency with moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension. Mild-moderate pericardial effusion with no evidence of haemodynamic compromise. Haemodynamic study: coronary arteries with tortuosity and irregularities, without angiographically significant stenosis. Right dominance. Normal sized LV, slightly hypertrophic, with preserved LVEF (58%), with very localised apical akinesia. Mild mitral insufficiency. LVEDP 13 mmHg. Slight calcification of aortic valve leaflets, especially the left coronary, without significant transvalvular gradient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): LV of normal size (38 mm) with asymmetric thickening of septal predominance in the middle and apical segments. Signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted sequences in the apical wall suggesting oedema. Heterogeneous late enhancement, transmural in the inferior wall and in subendocardial location in the anterior wall. There is also enhancement in both atria and the interatrial septum. Severe pericardial effusion. Slight bilateral pleural effusions. The findings described suggest amyloidosis.  Myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc-HDMP: chest study (late phase, planar and tomographic). Diffuse and homogeneous activity deposit of remarkable intensity is observed in the wall of both cardiac ventricles. Intense foci of uptake at the anterior ends of several ribs on both sides. Conclusion: findings consistent with the diagnosis of ATTR type cardiac amyloidosis.  EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the Cardiology hospital ward with telemetry monitoring on suspicion of syncope with a cardiogenic profile and clinical signs of heart failure, for the study of structural heart disease. Telemetry monitoring showed AF with MVR around 140 bpm, without significant pauses or arrhythmic events. A transthoracic echocardiographic study was started and completed with a haemodynamic study due to suspicion of a possible ischaemic aetiology. The echocardiographic study describes concentric hypertrophy with normal LV size, without segmental alterations of contractility, with severe LA dilatation and mild mitral and aortic insufficiency. Catheterisation showed coronary arteries without angiographically significant stenosis and localised apical akinesia. At this point, the clinical evolution during admission and test findings suggest CHF with preserved ejection fraction, with AF with rapid MVR and diastolic dysfunction. Diuretic treatment was intensified and MRI with gadolinium was requested to continue the study, given the suspicion of cardiomyopathy, in which normal-sized left ventricle with asymmetric thickening of predominantly septal in the middle and apical segments, with heterogeneous late enhancement, transmural in the inferior wall and in the subendocardial location in the anterior wall, suggestive of amyloidosis, was reported. In view of these results, myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc-HDMP was requested, and the findings were consistent with the diagnosis of ATTR type cardiac amyloidosis. In the following days, the patient progressively improved his clinical symptoms of heart failure, so he was discharged home after pharmacological adjustment for outpatient clinical follow-up in cardiology consultations.  DIAGNOSIS Syncope in the probable context of arterial hypotension. Heart failure with preserved EF. ATTR cardiac amyloidosis. Coronary arteries without angiographically significant stenosis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Alcoholic habit of 1-2 standard drink units per day. Obesity. Chronic ischaemic heart disease. 2-vessel disease. In 2015, due to stable angina, proximal anterior descending artery was revascularised with a drug-eluting stent. Subsequently in 2019, as a result of acute hypertensive pulmonary oedema, a new lesion was found in the circumflex ostium treated with a drug-eluting stent and a moderate lesion in the dominant right coronary artery that was not treated. Follow-up by the heart failure unit with severely depressed LVEF (recovered) of mixed aetiology (tachycardiomyopathy and ischaemic) in baseline functional class NYHA II. Paroxysmal atypical atrial flutter. Last electrical cardioversion (ECV) in October 2020, effective.  *** Last echocardiography 2019: left ventricle, with preserved diameters, volumes and global systolic function (EF 63%) with anterolateral medial and apical hypokinesia with preserved contractility of the remaining segments. Aortic sclerosis without significant functional repercussions. Diastolic pattern with single E wave with indirect data of slightly increased filling pressures. Dilated left atrium. Right ventricle with normal diameters and global systolic function. Mild tricuspid regurgitation, systolic pulmonary artery pressure approximately 65-70 mmHg (severe pulmonary hypertension [PHT]). Normal inferior vena cava.  Other history: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease moderate emphysema phenotype. Obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome with use of nocturnal CPAP. Bladder tumour pT1G3 + CIS in follow-up by urology. Stage IIIA chronic kidney disease (CKD) (baseline creatinine around 1.2) with exacerbation in the context of excessive blood pressure control. Chronic constipation with haemorrhoids and anal fissure.

Present illness 65-year-old male admitted to the coronary unit for acute hypertensive pulmonary oedema. The patient reported deterioration of functional class over 2 weeks of evolution to dyspnoea on light exertion, with orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (attenuated by nocturnal CPAP), with increased peripheral oedema without subjective decrease in diuresis in the context of decompensated CHF with no clear apparent trigger, although it could be related to uncontrolled arterial hypertension (AHT) at home. On arrival at the ED he presented with dyspnoea at rest in a situation of global respiratory failure in the context of acute hypertensive pulmonary oedema (165/95 mmHg). Depletive treatment was intensified with perfused furosemide together with non-invasive mechanical ventilation in BiPAP mode, achieving progressive negative balances and clinical improvement. During his stay, a right thoracentesis was also performed with an output of 1,000 ml of serous fluid with clinical improvement without complications. After clinical improvement and haemodynamic and respiratory stability, the patient was discharged to the cardiology ward. Four days later, the patient's dyspnoea worsened again with the need for NIMV, and bedside echocardiography was performed in the acute phase, describing significant acute mitral insufficiency due to asymmetrical posterior tethering.   Physical examination Conscious and oriented, eupneic at rest with NIMV in BiPAP mode. Adequate diuresis with furosemide perfusion.  Blood pressure 160/95 mmHg, heart rate 65 bpm, peripheral oxygen saturation 93% (FiO2 35%). Cardiac auscultation: regular sounds, systolic murmur II/VI. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, bilateral midbasal crackles, scattered rhonchi, right basal hypophonasis. Extremities: tibiomalleolar oedema with fovea, no signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS AP chest X-ray: signs of venous congestion, bilateral intersticioalveolar infiltrate predominantly basal, bilateral pleural effusion predominantly right. 12-lead electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 60 bpm, PR 200 ms, QRS 100 ms, poor septal vector progression, QS in V1-V2, ST-segment depression with asymmetric negative T in II, III, aVF, V5-V6, ST-segment elevation in aVR. Transthoracic echocardiogram at bedside: suboptimal examination due to sitting position. Left ventricle of normal diameters and volumes with slightly depressed global function secondary to anterolateral and lower middle basal hypokinesia with preserved contractility of the rest of the segments. Moderate-severe mitral insufficiency due to asymmetric posterior tethering. Aortic sclerosis without significant functional repercussions. Diastolic pattern with indirect data of increased filling pressures. Dilated left atrium. Right ventricle with normal diameters and global systolic function.

Nasopharyngeal exudate RT PCR SARS-CoV-2: negative. Catheterisation (videos 2-4): dominance: right dominant. Coronary arteries: significant stenosis. Truncus description: with atheromatosis without stenosis. Anterior descending description: good late result of the stent implanted on LD-CT. Circumflex description (CX): new ostial restenosis 90%, so new angioplasty is performed with implantation of ULTIMASTER TANSEI- sirolimus 3.0/12 mm drug-eluting stent, with minimal protrusion in LMCA and ending with post-dilatation in kissing balloon to avoid displacement of struts of the LMCA-AD stent. Right coronary description: dominant vessel unchanged with respect to previous exploration, with 50% lesion in proximal segment. Left radial with EBU 3.5 6F, BMW guides to DA and CX, predilatation with 3 balloons in kissing and implantation of ULTIMASTER TANSEI stent (3x12) with stopper balloon in TCI-DA and final postdilatation in kissing. Conclusions: recurrent in-stent restenosis in CX ostium. PTCA on the SIRS with sirolimus DES implantation and final post-dilatation in kissing. Moderate lesion persists in proximal DC with no changes with respect to the previous exploration.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On re-admission he was desaturated, with intense respiratory work and mildly obnubilised, so non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) was started with a very good initial response and perfusion of furosemide. After clinical and blood pressure stabilisation, a new echocardiogram was performed which showed normalisation of the previously described alterations in segmental contractility and a decrease in the degree of mitral regurgitation to mild. Due to suspicion of acute mitral insufficiency (echocardiography in 2019 did not reveal mitral insufficiency) in the context of ischaemia due to high blood pressure, coronary angiography was performed, revealing in-stent restenosis in the circumflex ostium, which was treated with a new drug-eluting stent. Control tests showed recovery of renal function to baseline and correction of initial mild hyperkalaemia to mild hypokalaemia, requiring supplementary potassium, and a red blood cell concentrate due to anaemia without active bleeding. The patient continued to progress favourably until transferred to a conventional hospital ward and was subsequently discharged home. In a patient with high ischaemic risk (cardiovascular risk factors, chronic ischaemic heart disease and previous peripheral artery disease and in-stent restenosis) and high haemorrhagic risk (normocytic-normochromic anaemia due to digestive losses, bladder tumour under follow-up, poorly controlled hypertension at home and chronic kidney disease), double therapy was prescribed with apixaban 5 mg every 12 hours and clopidogrel 75 mg daily; triple therapy was used during hospitalisation. The change from edoxaban to apixaban is due to the consideration of the European guidelines for atrial fibrillation of the use of apixaban or dabigatran 110 mg due to the lower rate of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to warfarin. As an obese patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus under suboptimal treatment with HbA1c of 7.4%, semaglutide 0.25 mg weekly subcutaneously is started for 4 weeks with a view to increasing to 0.5 and 1 mg thereafter. In addition, metformin/empagliflozin 1,000 mg/5 mg every 12 h is added (and if tolerated will be increased to 1,000 mg/12.5 mg every 12 h). Subsequently, insulin therapy is reduced according to requirements. The patient continues with controls in the heart failure unit without incident.  DIAGNOSIS Acute pulmonary oedema in the context of acute ischaemic mitral insufficiency. In-stent restenosis of the circumflex artery. Type 2 diabetes mellitus with suboptimal treatment. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Cardiovascular risk factors: ex-smoker for 11 years, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. No other known cardiovascular risk factors. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. Cardiological history: Lateral ischaemic heart disease type STEMI in April 2016, 2-vessel coronary artery disease with primary percutaneous coronary intervention on diagonal branch. Second time on right coronary artery. Complete revascularisation. In 2020, repeat cardiac catheterisation during admission for chest pain, with epicardial coronary arteries without angiographic lesions. Congenital valvular heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve. Transthoracic echocardiogram in 2020: left ventricle (LV) slightly dilated. Mild left ventricular dysfunction (EF 45%) with altered contractility in the inferior and apical territory. Moderate aortic stenosis and mild aortic insufficiency. Usual NYHA functional class II/IV. Ascending aortic aneurysm with a maximum diameter of 46 mm. Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) in sinus with LBBB.   On regular treatment with acetylsalicylic acid, atorvastatin, ramipril, bisoprolol, spironolactone, tamsulosin and dutasteride.  Present illness The patient was transferred to the hospital emergency room by the emergency service for an episode of chest pain lasting more than one hour, which began with minimal exertion at home. It was oppressive central chest pain, with concomitant vegetative cortex, which in the initial assessment presented arterial hypotension and rhythm disturbances with second-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) Mobitz I. During the transfer, powerful analgesic treatment was started, with no symptomatic improvement. He arrived at the emergency department with pain. Given the high suspicion of acute aortic syndrome, angio-CT was requested and ruled it out. At that time, cardiology was requested to collaborate.  Physical examination On arrival at the ED, still with central thoracic pain, blood pressure persisted at 87/50 mmHg and heart rate of 55 bpm. On evaluation by cardiology after angio-CT which ruled out acute aortic syndrome, he showed signs of distal hypoperfusion and marked tendency to arterial hypotension with 80/40 mmHg, heart rate of 40 bpm, baseline oxygen saturation of 97%. Elevation of central venous pressure, jugular ingurgitation +. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, pan-focal systolic murmur with associated Gallavardin phenomenon. Pulmonary auscultation: normonophonesis in all fields. Abdomen without semiology of ascites, soft, depressible, not painful on palpation. No masses or visceromegaly palpable. Lower limbs without oedema, with signs of poor distal perfusion.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS ECG: his previous baseline ECG with LBBB showed repolarisation alterations compatible with acute myocardial ischaemia and advanced AV conduction disorder. Thoracic CT angiography: bicuspid aorta, calcified. Fusiform dilatation of the ascending aorta, with a maximum diameter of 52 mm. No aortic flap, intramural haematoma or other acute aortic parietal lesions are identified. Absence of coronary calcium. There was no opacification of the anterior descending artery from D1, with progressive narrowing of its calibre, suggestive of non-atherogenic occlusion of the anterior descending artery. Left ventricular dilatation with diffuse myocardial thinning, more accentuated in the anterior wall. Signs of cardiogenic interstitial pulmonary oedema and mild bilateral pleural effusion. No pericardial effusion. Emergency transthoracic echocardiogram: dilated left ventricle (LV). Severely depressed left ventricular function (LVEF 10% by Simpson) with anteroseptal, anterior and apical segment akinesia. CBC: troponin I US 101.2 ng/l -> 306,540.8 ng/l (normal <18 ng/l), creatinine 0.94 mg/dl, sodium 136 mEq/l, potassium 4.8 mEq/l. Haemogram: leucocytes 30,400/mm3 (N 28,600/mm3; L 700/mm3), haemoglobin 13.4 g/dl.  Urgent cardiac catheterisation: transient pacemaker via the right femoral vein, positioned in the apex of the left ventricle (LV). Acute thrombotic occlusion in proximal anterior descending (LAD) with TIMI 0 flow. Thromboaspiration and angioplasty with conventional 2.5 mm balloon achieved flow in the anterior descending and, subsequently, in the diagonal branch, leaving TIMI 3 flow in both arteries.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the high suspicion of acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation Killip-Kimball IV, the infarction code was activated and a central venous line was channelled for the infusion of vasoactive drugs prior to transfer to the haemodynamics room (dobutamine and noradrenaline). During the transfer he presented cardiorespiratory arrest in ventricular fibrillation, so advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres were started, and he recovered a pulse after defibrillation at 200J. Orotracheal intubation was performed and the patient was transferred with a transcutaneous pacemaker and sedorelaxed, finally arriving at the haemodynamics room. There, a transient pacemaker was implanted via the right femoral vein and continuous perfusion of noradrenaline and dobutamine was maintained at 0.9 and 8 μgr/kg/min, respectively. Embolic occlusion of the proximal LAD and diagonal branch was revascularised. Admitted to the intensive care unit. Initially, favourable evolution. Recovery of atrioventricular conduction after revascularisation, but temporary safety pacemaker is maintained at 50 bpm. Echocardiogram showed severely depressed ventricular function, LVEF by Simpson around 15%, with anteroseptal akinesia, anterior mid-apical and all apical segments, asynchronous septal movement, as well as a RV of normal size and function. Given the haemodynamic improvement, noradrenaline was started and the patient was extubated without incident, maintaining oxygen saturation with low-flow nasal cannulae and negative water balance. However, 24 hours after admission, he began to experience unstable angina that became refractory, together with haemodynamic deterioration. Given the severity of the condition and the lack of response, it was decided, together with the family, to limit the therapeutic effort and, finally, he died.  DIAGNOSIS Ischaemic heart disease. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, Killip IV. Acute embolic occlusion of the anterior descending artery. Severely depressed left ventricular function. Primary ventricular fibrillation. Complete ischaemic atrioventricular block. Cardiogenic shock. Exitus. Valvular heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve disease with moderate stenosis and dilatation of the ascending aorta. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cardiological history: ischaemic heart disease: triple bypass in September 2015 due to severe disease of the trunk and three vessels, proximal anterior descending, proximal-medial circumflex and posterior interventricular. He had lost clinical follow-up, with last transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in 2018: left ventricle with moderate concentric hypertrophy, LVEF 50% with hypokinesia of lower middle and basal segments, no valvulopathies and normal right ventricular function. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation diagnosed in 2012. He had recently undergone electrical cardioversion (ECV). Other medical and surgical history: vertebrobasilar ischaemic stroke in 2017, with no sequelae. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) 3bA1 probably secondary to nephroangiosclerosis. Polyposis of the colon with multiple endoscopic exeresis. Hyperuricaemia with gout crisis. Surgical interventions: coronary bypass, right inguinal herniorrhaphy, cataracts.

Present illness A 78-year-old man came to the emergency department for progressive dyspnoea of months of evolution, more marked in the last 20 days until minimal effort (baseline NYHA I-II/IV, consultation in functional class III/IV), despite a course of furosemide 2 tablets a day for the last week by his primary care physician. He had an increase in his baseline orthopnoea and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND), as well as progressive oedematisation of the lower limbs since the previous month. He reported clinical symptoms compatible with exertional angina, consisting of oppressive central thoracic and epigastric pain, non-radiating, without vegetative cortex, which had subsided after 15 minutes with rest since approximately 4 months previously, stable with no recent progression. He denied palpitations. No fever or other infectious symptoms on physical examination.  Physical examination Blood pressure 115/69 mmHg, heart rate 60 bpm, oxygen saturation 94% (with O2 through nasal goggles at 2 l/min). Afebrile. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. Skin pallor. Eupneic at rest. No jugular engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: regular heart sounds, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: generalised hypophonesis, bibasal crackles. Abdomen soft and depressible, not painful, no masses or megaliths. Lower limbs with oedema up to the root of the limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, signs of left atrial enlargement, PR 240 ms, QRS 100 ms, precordial R progression defect, QS in inferior face. Chest X-ray on admission: no infiltrates or masses, increased cardiothoracic index (CTI), slight right costophrenic sinus impingement, median sternotomy sutures.  Laboratory tests: haemogram: red cells 4.13 10*12/l, haemoglobin 12.8 g/dl, haematocrit 39.1 %, MCV 94.8 fl, MCH 30.9 pg, ADE 15%, leukocytes 5.8 10*9/l, neutrophils 4.1 10*9/l, lymphocytes 1.1 10*9/l, monocytes 0.4 10*9/l, eosinophils 0.1 10*9/l, basophils 0 10*9/l, platelets 150 10*9/l. Biochemistry: glucose 88 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium 3.5 mEq/l, chlorine 106 mEq/l, GPT 40 U/l, urea 83 mg/dl, creatinine 1.67 mg/dl, transferrin saturation index 17%, ferritin 47 mcg/l, C-reactive protein 0.8 mg/dl. Haemostasis: Quick's index 32%, INR 2.22, aPTT 35.7 s, derived fibrinogen 464 mg/dl. Serum proteinogram: albumin 53.5%, alpha 1 globulin 4.5%, alpha 2 globulin 13.6%, beta globulin 12%, gamma globulin 16.4%, albumin/globulin ratio 1.1%. No monoclonal peak is observed. Free light chains in serum and urine negative. TTE: severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. Hypokinesia in lower mid-basal segments. Diastolic pattern with single E wave with data suggestive of increased filling pressures. Trivial mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic insufficiency. Mild left atrial dilatation. Right ventricle with preserved systolic function. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI) allowing estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPS) of approximately 35-40 mmHg. Plethoric inferior vena cava (IVC). Exploration in atrial fibrillation (AF) with RV as 80 bpm.  Cardiac MRI (video 3, images 3 and 4): left ventricle (LV) of normal volumes (LVOT 85 ml/m2, STV 32 ml/m2) with increased myocardial mass (LVMI 114 g/m2) and concentric hypertrophy (septum 21 mm and posterior wall 17 mm) with basal and mid inferior hypokinesia with preserved global systolic function (LVEF 62%). STIR sequences show mild myocardial oedema at anterior, anteroseptal, mid inferoseptal, anterior and apical septal levels. Right ventricle (RV) not dilated (RVOT 94 ml/m2, STV 41 ml/m2) with preserved global systolic function (RVEF 56%). Aorta and great vessels of normal diameter and morphology. Left atrium slightly dilated. Estimated normal pulmonary vascular resistance (mean pulmonary velocity 11 cm/s). Gadoteric acid (0.15 mM/kg) is administered: well tolerated by the patient. Necrosis and viability detection study: presence of myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) suggestive of subendocardial necrosis at anterior segment level with diffuse epicardial fibrosis at septal and inferior basal, middle and apical segments; as well as difficulty in myocardial nulling on viability sequences suggesting diffuse intramyocardial fibrosis with subendocardial RV LGE. Whole body bone scan: after 3 hours of tracer infusion (99mTc-HDP) increased uptake is observed at the level of the cardiac silhouette of greater intensity than the surrounding bone structures (score 3). Genetic study: study of the TTR gene, ruling out the presence of a mutation.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION A diagnosis of decompensated heart failure was made in the emergency department and treatment with intravenous diuretics was started. Diuretic response was poor, requiring oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation, and the patient was admitted to the cardiology ward to complete the study and treatment. The patient's evolution was slowly favourable with depletive treatment. Renal function deteriorated secondary to heart failure and intensive use of diuretics. In addition, iron deficiency anaemia was detected, so a single dose of 1,000 mg of iron carboxymaltose was administered. Echocardiography showed severe left ventricular hypertrophy with a granular pattern, compatible with infiltrative cardiomyopathy, and cardiac MRI was performed, identifying a pattern suggestive of amyloidosis. Therefore, a serum proteinogram and detection of free light chains in serum and urine were performed, which, being negative, ruled out the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. With the suspicion of amyloidosis due to TTR, a bone scan with bisphosphonates was requested. After recovery of renal function to baseline levels, the patient was discharged from hospital with follow-up by the heart failure unit. The patient underwent outpatient scintigraphy, showing increased uptake in the cardiac silhouette of greater intensity than in the bone structures, establishing the diagnosis of amyloidosis due to TTR. A genetic study was performed, which was negative. At subsequent visits, the patient has remained stable in NYHA functional class II/IV.  DIAGNOSIS Decompensated heart failure. Cardiac amyloidosis due to wtTTR.  Other diagnoses: Exacerbated chronic kidney disease. Normocytic anaemia with iron deficiency. Chronic ischaemic heart disease. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL COURSE Non-syncopal sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, with clinical involvement and acceptable haemodynamic tolerance. Electrical cardioversion to sinus rhythm. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed in the emergency department prior to admission to cardiology, showing mild LV dysfunction and significant dilatation of the RV. As part of the study and in order to rule out underlying coronary artery disease that could justify the arrhythmia, a CT scan of the coronary arteries was performed without lesions, showing RV dilatation with irregular contour. Studies were completed with a CMR compatible with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, predominantly of the RV, although the LV was also affected. Finally, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted for secondary prevention. Stable throughout admission, he was discharged without incident with neurohormonal treatment with bisoprolol and ramipril. During follow-up, the patient remained without clinical incidents or device therapies. A genetic test was requested, which was positive in homozygosis for the pathogenic variant p.T335A in the desmoglein 2 gene (DSG2).  DIAGNOSIS Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with biventricular involvement: moderate LV and RV systolic dysfunction. Episode of non-syncopal sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. ICD implantation for secondary prevention. Homozygous carrier of pathogenic variant in desmoglein 2 gene. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Immunoglobulins: IgA 5.19 g/l (0.7-4), C4 0.45 g/l (0.1-0.4). Rest normal. Autoimmunity: ANA positive (titre 1/80, homogeneous pattern). ANA negative. ANCA negative. Negative antiphospholipid antibodies. Cryoglobulins: negative. Kappa and Lambda free light chains: normal levels. HIV, HBV and HCV serology: negative. Quantiferon TB: positive 1.26 UI/ml.  Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle of normal thickness, slightly dilated. LVEF severely affected (28%) at the expense of severe hypokinesia of the mid anterior and lateral wall segments and all apical segments. Relaxation pattern not assessable by wave fusion. Right ventricle of normal size and function. Moderately dilated left atrium (area 33 cm2). Aortic valve trivalve, normofunctioning. Mitral valve with slightly thickened leaflets, with central regurgitation jet of moderate insufficiency (ERO 0.36 cm2, MR volume 35 ml, intermediate density Doppler). Mild tricuspid insufficiency. PSAP of 48 mmHg + PVC (normal). The presence of intraventricular thrombus is ruled out with contrast. Diagnostic coronary angiography: Severe coronary artery disease of three vessels: middle and distal anterior descending artery, first diagonal branch, distal circumflex artery, distal right coronary artery and posterolatereal branch. Very bad distal beds, diffusely diseased. No response to intracoronary nitroglycerin. Beds not revascularisable. Computed tomography angiography: thoracic aorta of normal dimensions. Supra-aortic trunks without alterations. Patent abdominal aorta. Celiac trunk, common hepatic artery and splenic artery of fine calibre with a perivascular cuff. The splenic artery is very thin distally, showing hypoperfusion in the spleen at this stage. Superior and inferior mesenteric arteries of fine calibre with perivascular cuff. Common iliac arteries, external iliac arteries, common femoral and superficial femoral arteries with decreased calibre and perivascular cuffing. Conclusion: findings suggestive of medium vessel vasculitis. Positron emission tomography: No increase in glucose metabolism in the wall of the large arterial vessels suggestive of vasculitis is visualised. It should be remembered that corticosteroid treatment causes false negatives and that the sensitivity of PET is lower in medium and small vessel vasculitis. Two hypermetabolic foci were identified in the colon, one in the descending colon (SUVmax 8.09) and the other in the sigma (SUVmax 9.13), which we recommend evaluating by colonoscopy to rule out malignant tumour pathology. Doppler ultrasound of supra-aortic trunks: Left carotid axis with a small plaque at the level of the bulb, predominantly fibrolipid, with a smooth and regular surface, which does not cause haemodynamic alterations. Normal flows in left CCA, ICA and CEA. Right carotid axis with normal echostructure. Vertebral arteries permeable and orthodromic. Abdominal X-ray: dilated large bowel loops with an image suggestive of cecal volvulus in the right hypochondrium.  Computed tomography of the abdomen: cecal volvulus, probably partial, of the cecal scale type. Mural endoluminal polyps in the splenic angle of the colon, measuring 15 mm, and in the rectosigmoid junction, measuring 11 mm, both with uptake in the previous PET-CT study. Radiological improvement of the signs of vasculitis of the celiac trunk and superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. A more prominent perivascular cuff persists in the primitive and external iliac vessels with probably significant stenosis of femoral arteries. Colonoscopy: the ileum is reached. In the cecum there are aphthae arranged in a linear fashion, covered with fibrin compatible with ischaemic colitis. Two polyps were observed: one of them measuring about 15 mm in the descending colon. No other lesions were observed. Biopsy of skin, subcutaneous cellular tissue, muscle and sural nerve: non-specific inflammatory findings with no evidence of vasculitis. Electroneurography/electromyography: patchy involvement of motor and sensory fibres of the right ulnar, peroneal and tibial nerves suggesting mononeuritis multiplex. Echocardiography at discharge: severely dilated left ventricle (indexed VTD 158 ml/m2). Akinesia with thinning of all apical segments. Medial anterior akinesia and medial anterior, medial anterolateral and medial inferolateral septum. Medial inferior hypokinesia and basal inferior septum. Severe systolic dysfunction (biplane Simpson calculation with Sonovue LVEF 25%). No apical thrombus after echocontrast injection. Restrictive pattern diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Severe left atrial dilatation. Mild right atrial dilatation. Normal sized right ventricle with preserved function. Severe functional mitral regurgitation. Thin leaflets with symmetrical tenting of the leaflets. Central regurgitant jet with dense, wide, holosystolic flow with severe regurgitation. ERO 0.6 cm2. Mild aortic insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency. Pulmonary hypertension at rest.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In the coronary unit, amiodarone perfusion and oxygen therapy with high-flow glasses was started, achieving clinical stabilisation in the first 24 hours, with reversion of flutter to sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, negative balances of almost 3 litres and marked clinical improvement. The first echocardiography and coronary angiography were performed. In view of the catheterisation findings, an assessment was requested from the internal medicine department with the suspicion of a vasculitic condition as the cause of the coronary lesions. That same day, treatment was started with corticosteroid boluses, oral prednisone and later methotrexate as an immunosuppressant. From the clinical point of view, the patient was admitted for a very long time, with a hospital stay of almost 40 days. Cardiologically, the patient showed a rapid and favourable evolution during the first week and was discharged to the conventional hospital ward. However, on the seventh day of admission (after the PET scan), he presented an arrhythmic storm with three episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia that required electrical cardioversion and multiple non-sustained episodes. For this reason, he had to be transferred again to the coronary unit and was started on lidocaine perfusion, midazolam and beta-blocker with a good response. He did not suffer any more arrhythmic events and presented a slow but adequate evolution of his heart failure. During the second week, the patient suffered a paralytic ileus, with suspicion of associated cecal volvulus (which was the reason for requesting an abdominal CT scan and colonoscopy) which improved with digestive rest, nasogastric tube and antibiotic treatment without the need for surgery. Lastly, it should be mentioned that on admission the patient had very severe skin involvement, with erythroderma secondary to his psoriasis, as well as involvement of the hands and feet with signs of poor perfusion that slowly improved with medical treatment. As for the aetiological diagnosis, computed tomography angiography showed lesions suspicious of vasculitis in the visceral arteries and in both iliac arteries without involvement of the supra-aortic trunks. The complete blood test showed a rather anodyne result with elevation of several non-specific inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, complement, IL-6...) but with negative results in the key tests (ENA, ANCA, cryoglobulins, antiphospholipid antibodies, HBV, HCV and HIV serology...). In view of the results, PET-CT was ordered in the hope of confirming inflammation data at the vascular level to support the presumptive diagnosis (at that time Takayasu-type large vessel vasculitis was the main candidate). However, the absence of uptake in the supra-aortic trunks ruled out this pathology. Following this setback, multiple diagnostic studies were requested with the intention of confirming medium-vessel vasculitis (mainly polyarteritis nodosa, PAN). A skin, subcutaneous tissue and nerve biopsy was performed, as well as an electromyogram/electroneurogram. It is worth mentioning that the initial intention was to perform a direct arterial biopsy of the iliac/femoral territory (a territory known to be affected by the scan data). However, this option was discarded following vascular surgery assessment which considered, given the calibre of the vessels involved, that the risk of complications (ischaemia and/or haemorrhage) was too high. The biopsy found no data suggestive of vasculitis, but the electromyogram showed a pattern of mononeuritis multiplex, very typical of PAN. The clinical course was favourable and he was discharged after implantation of an automatic defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention. As for the diagnosis, it was concluded (given the vascular involvement, the multiple mononeuritis and the improvement with anti-inflammatory drugs) that the most likely cause of the patient's clinical picture was polyarteritis nodosa. However, given the multiple cardiovascular risk factors (including cocaine use), early atherosclerosis was always considered as a possible alternative. She was discharged with immunosuppressive and steroid treatment, oral anticoagulation, acetylsalicylic acid, statins and full medical treatment of heart failure, to continue outpatient follow-up in the advanced heart failure unit.  DIAGNOSIS PAN type vasculitis with coronary, celiac, mesenteric and femoral involvement. Ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Heart failure in acute pulmonary oedema on admission, euvolemic on discharge. Non-revascularisable three-vessel coronary artery disease (diffuse arterial disease compatible with vasculitis). Arrhythmic storm. ICD implantation in secondary prevention. Uncommon atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, pharmacological cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Ischaemic colitis. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION According to protocol, 1,000 mg of intravenous iron carboxymaltose (Ferinject ®) was administered weekly for 2 weeks, and after confirming normalisation of the iron profile with analytical tests, a new structural assessment was performed. CMR after 4 weeks of iron treatment: left ventricle with preserved wall thickness and diastolic volume (IVTDVI 84 ml/m2; IVTSVI 48 ml/m2). Moderately depressed global systolic function (LVEF 43%), secondary to generalised hypokinesia. Right ventricle of preserved morphology and volumes (IVTDVD 65 ml/m2; IVTSVD 30 ml/m2) and borderline systolic function (LVEF 54%). Left atrium of normal size: 34 mm, 23 cm2, 13 cm2/m2. Aorta and great vessels of normal diameter and morphology. T1 myocardium: 1037 ms T2* myocardium: 38 ms. There was significant improvement in LV ejection fraction estimated by CMR (LVEF 43% at 30 days), with a decrease in T1 mapping to 1037 ms, indicating myocardial iron repletion.  In addition, there was evidence of an increase in GLS to -19.1%. These changes were accompanied by improvement in quality of life, 6-minute test and other surrogates of heart failure.  DIAGNOSIS Dilated cardiomyopathy with severely depressed LVEF. Absolute iron deficiency. Myocardial iron repletion after treatment with iron carboxymaltose (Ferinject). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O
We present the case of a 71-year-old patient diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction of ischaemic aetiology, who was admitted for an episode of decompensation. During his stay, he underwent global management beyond diuretic therapy, which led to an improvement in his functional class.  HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): hypertension and dyslipidaemia. No toxic habits. Permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) anticoagulated with acenocoumarol. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction of ischaemic aetiology. Acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in 2002 with three-vessel disease and severe ventricular dysfunction without improvement after complete surgical revascularisation in June 2002. Implantable defibrillator with cardiac resynchronisation therapy (ICD-CRT) in primary prevention since 2016. Last TTE performed in consultation (01/2021): severely dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF by Simpson biplane: 24.5%). Septal, apical, inferior and inferolateral akinesia. Anterior and lateral hypokinesia. Severe mitral insufficiency (MI) of probable mixed mechanism. Severe dilatation of the right ventricle (RV) with preserved function. Severe dilatation of both atria. Moderate aortic stenosis. Moderate tricuspid insufficiency (TI) grade III. Estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) of 50 mmHg. Peripheral arterial disease assessed by vascular surgery with no need for follow-up. Hyperuricaemia. Usual treatment: furosemide 40 mg (2 tablets daily), eplerenone 25 mg (1 tablet at lunch), valsartan 80 mg (half a day), carvedilol 3.25 mg (at breakfast and dinner), acenocoumarol as prescribed, atorvastatin 20 mg (at dinner), nitrate patch 5 mg, allopurinol 300 mg (at dinner), omeprazole 20 mg (at breakfast).  Current disease Previously in functional class (FC) I-II, he reported increasing dyspnoea until minimal effort, associated with orthopnoea and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND). In addition, oliguria, oedematisation of the lower extremities (LES) and weight gain. He relates the worsening to the reduction of valsartan doses a few weeks ago due to recurrent episodes of hypotension. Physical examination Weight 88.5 kg (dry weight not recorded), height 1.65m. Body mass index (BMI) 32 kg/m2. Blood pressure (BP) 109/84 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 108 bpm, oxygen saturation breathing room air 96%, afebrile. Eupneic at rest, slight increase in jugular pressure, absent hepatojugular reflux. Cardiac auscultation irregular and without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: bibasal crackles. Extremities with bimalleolar oedema. Peripheral pulses weak but preserved and symmetrical.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG) on arrival at the emergency department: atrial fibrillation at 80 bpm, ventricular pacing mediated by ICD-CRT. Chest X-ray: mild cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic index [CTI] 0.52), mild vascular redistribution, ICD-CRT generator and electrodes normally positioned, without costophrenic sinus impingement. Blood tests on admission: haemoglobin 13.3 g/dl, leucocytes 4930*103/ul, platelets 103000 /Ul. Biochemistry: glucose 86 mg/dl, creatinine 1.26 mg/dl, urea 48 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate 57 ml/min/1.73 m2, sodium 137 mg/dl, potassium 3.6 mg/dl, total bilirubin 4.2 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.2, lactate dehydrogenase 241 U/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20, total protein 44 g/l, albumin 36 g/l. TSH 2.16 mU/l. Troponin T 46 ng/l-> 50 ng/l (< 14 ng/l). NT-proBNP 2154 pg/l (< 300 pg/l). Ferrokinetic profile: iron 87 uG/dl (59-156), transferrin saturation index 23% (16-45), ferritin 90 ng/ml (30-400). Transesophageal echocardiography performed during admission: severe ischaemic mitral insufficiency. Posterior leaflet of 7 mm. Thrombus in left atrial appendage. Moderate IT grade III. Moderate aortic stenosis with AVA of 1.3. IT signal allows estimating PAPS of 54 mmHg.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION On admission, intravenous furosemide was started with a good diuretic response. In addition, given the elevation of direct bilirubin, abdominal ultrasound was requested, which revealed liver stasis in the context of heart failure. The CRT device was checked and the pacing % was found to be in an adequate range.  Transesophageal echocardiography was requested to expand studies on the severe MI described in the last transthoracic echocardiography performed in consultations, which confirmed the severity of the Ml of ischaemic origin and visualised an image compatible with thrombus in the left atrial appendage. The patient had normal haemoglobin levels, with normal iron and transferrin saturation index, but ferritin less than 100 ng/l. In this context, in view of the iron deficiency situation, it was decided to start iron therapy with an infusion of 1,000 mg of iron carboxymaltose. During admission, she showed clinical improvement with a loss of up to 5 kg compared to her admission weight after diuretic therapy and great symptomatic improvement. Throughout his hospital stay, his blood pressure was around 100/70 mmHg, with symptoms of orthostasis when attempting to increase anti-humoral therapy, so it was decided not to start sacubitril/valsartan. Finally, he was discharged with a change of valsartan to losartan 25 mg, bisoprolol 1.25 mg (at breakfast and dinner) instead of carvedilol, and discontinuation of acenocoumarol and start of edoxaban 60 mg (daily) together with furosemide 40 mg (2 tablets daily), eplerenone 25 mg (1 tablet at lunch), atorvastatin 20 mg (at dinner), allopurinol 300 mg (at dinner), omeprazole 20 mg (at breakfast). In addition, an outpatient cardiac CT scan was requested to assess the viability of implanting a Tendyne prosthesis as a treatment for mitral insufficiency and to evaluate the persistence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage after correct oral anticoagulation. One month after discharge and after 3 weeks in NYHA functional class I, the patient came for a check-up. He presented blood tests showing sudden anaemisation with haemoglobin levels of 10.5; in addition, the patient reported clinical manifestations of melena since discharge. It was decided to request invasive studies to investigate the aetiology of the anaemia, with gastroscopy and colonoscopy, which were normal. The patient is currently awaiting capsule endoscopy.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure with reduced EF of ischaemic aetiology with episode of decompensation due to systemic congestion. Severe ischaemic mitral regurgitation. Moderate grade III tricuspid regurgitation. Ferropenia with normal haemoglobin levels. Permanent atrial fibrillation. Thrombus in left atrial appendage. Carrier of ICD-CRT in prevention 1a with adequate pacing %. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History This is a 72-year-old man with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, ex-smoker), permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with warfarin (previously with acenocoumarol; the anticoagulant was changed in 2017 after finding a thrombus in the left atrial appendage despite correct INR levels) and rheumatic valve disease with valve replacement in 2004 with mechanical prostheses in mitral and aortic position, without significant lesions in pre-surgical coronary angiography and with a subsequent LVEF of 30%. During follow-up, he presented a tendency towards asymptomatic moderate hyperkalaemia (maximum figure of 6.3 mEq/l) that prevented correct titration of neurohormonal medication, remaining in NYHA functional class III/IV. In September 2019, he attended the emergency department due to worsening of his usual dyspnoea to minimal effort, orthopnoea, bendopnoea, decreased diuresis rate and the appearance of oedema in the lower limbs.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 110/55 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 90 bpm. Temperature 36.2 oC. Oxygen saturation 95% basal. Acceptable general condition. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Normal colour, normohydrated and normoperfused. Discreetly tachypnoeic at rest, with intolerance to decubitus.  Cardiac auscultation: arrhythmic heart sounds. Prosthetic metallic clicks. No murmurs were heard. Pulmonary auscultation: bilateral crackles up to midfields, no other superimposed sounds. Lower extremities: symmetrical pulses present and symmetrical. Bilateral pitting oedema up to the knees. No signs of deep vein thrombosis. Current treatment: candesartan 4 mg (0-0-1), furosemide 40 mg (1-0-1), simvastatin 20 mg (0-0-1), bisoprolol 2.5 mg (1-0-1), warfarin 5 mg as prescribed, metformin 850 mg (0.5-0-0.5), pantoprazole 20 mg (1-0-0) Given that this was his first episode of decompensation of heart failure, admission to the conventional cardiology ward for depletive treatment and study was decided.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests on admission: haemoglobin 15.1 g/dl (11.4-15.1 g/dl), creatinine 1.78 mg/dl (0.50-0.90 mg/dl), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 41 ml/min/1.73 m2 (> 90 ml/min/1.73 m2), sodium 139 mEq/l (135-145 mEq/l), potassium 5.6 mEq/l (135-145 mEq/l), sodium 5.6 mEq/l (0.50-0.90 mg/dl), potassium 5.6 mEq/l (3.50-5.00 mEq/l), GPT 21 U/l (5-35 U/l), GOT 22 U/l (5-27 U/l), NT-proBNP 2651 pg/ml (<= 125 pg/ml), glycosylated haemoglobin 6.9% (4.0-6.0). Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission: atrial fibrillation with ventricular response at 85 bpm. Wide QRS with right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology. Chest X-ray on admission: mid-sternotomy cerclages. Mechanical prosthesis in mitral position. Signs of pulmonary congestion (vascular redistribution, bilateral pleural effusion). Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) severely dilated (Dd 63 mm, VTD 201 ml, VTDi 118 ml/m2), with slight concentric hypertrophy. Global hypokinesia. Biplane Simpson LVEF 20%. Right ventricle of borderline size (Dd 40 mm), with severely depressed global systolic function. Mechanical prosthesis in mitral and aortic position well seated, with normal disc motion, no gradient elevation or periprosthetic insufficiency.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Intravenous diuretic treatment was started with an excellent response and clear improvement in the congestive signs and symptoms, which led to discharge home after 8 days of hospitalisation. Serial analyses showed normalisation of renal function. In this context, it was decided to start a potassium chelator (patiromer at a minimum dose, i.e. one 8.4 g sachet per day) with the aim of normalising serum potassaemia figures in order to be able to start neurohormonal treatment. Follow-up was initiated in the Transversal Heart Failure Programme of our centre. A blood test was performed one month later, which showed serum potassaemia of 4.1 mEq/l, so it was decided to increase the dose of ARA-II (candesartan 8 mg every 24 hours). On review in consultation (November 2019), the patient reported improvement in his functional class to NYHA II/IV, with potassium levels remaining in the normal range. Given the good tolerance, it was decided to change to sacubitril/valsartan at low doses (24/26 mg every 12 hours), with which the improvement in functional class progressed to NYHA I/IV (December 2019): the patient reported that he could walk 2-4 km on level ground, as well as climb slopes and several flights of stairs without having to stop.  As serum potassaemia remains in range, a mineralcorticoid receptor antagonist (low-dose spironolactone) is started. At the next check-up, a new blood test showed slight hyperkalaemia (5.58 mEq/l), so it was decided to increase the dose of patiromer to two sachets (16.8 g) per day. With this, serum portasium levels were again normalised; at this time (February 2020) the patient was taking sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg every 12 hours and spironolactone 25 mg every 24 hours, and it was decided to maintain this treatment unchanged. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, he was seen again in September 2020, when he presented serum potassaemia of 6.30 mEq/l, so the patiromer was titrated up to the maximum dose (25.2 g every 24 hours) and the dose of spironolactone was reduced to 12.5 mg every 24 hours. Three months later, potassium levels were at the upper limit of normal (5.19 mEq/l), so the same treatment was maintained. In January 2021, a control transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing an increase in LVEF to 35% and a clear improvement in adverse remodelling with a decrease in ventricular volumes, as well as normalisation of right ventricular function, with the prostheses remaining normal. The patient remains in good functional class (NYHA I-II/IV), and analytically there was a clear decrease in NT-proBNP during follow-up, with no notable adverse effects.  DIAGNOSIS Chronic heart failure with severely depressed LVEF of valvular origin. Carrier of mechanical prosthetic aortic and mitral valves. Asymptomatic moderate hyperkalaemia in the context of neurohormonal treatment for heart failure. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History This is a 66-year-old female patient with no family history of early ischaemic heart disease or sudden death. Mother died of stroke at 73 years of age.  Personal history: No documented drug allergies. Lifestyle: active life, walks 45-60 minutes daily with her group of friends. Currently retired. Previously employed in perfumery. Cardiovascular risk factors: ex-smoker for 25 years (IPA 10 packs/year), slightly overweight (body mass index 27 kg/m2). No other risk factors. Cardiovascular history: symptomatic non-valvular paroxysmal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since 2017 (EHRA 3: could not keep up with her companions while walking). No structural heart disease on echocardiogram (left atrium of borderline size and preserved LVEF). Radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary veins was performed in January 2018, still paroxysmal) achieving bidirectional isolation. He presented acute reconnection during the procedure through the ligament of Marshall, successfully ablated in the anterior carina region. During the blanking period she was treated with flecainide 100 mg/12h and dabigatran 150 mg/12h. The patient underwent cardiac rhythm self-measurements every 48 h with a Kardia device and a 24 h Holter at 3 months without evidence of arrhythmic recurrence being documented in any of these controls. Anticoagulation was discontinued due to CHA2DS2VASc 1 point (female) and the antiarrhythmic was progressively reduced until discontinuation. Other history: untreated mild psoriasis. No history of asthma, nor previous need for bronchodilators.   Current illness Since the summer of 2020, she presents clinical deterioration, which she refers to as recurrence of palpitations, mainly with exertion, but also during periods of rest, which she describes as similar to those prior to the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) and limitation of physical activity with a marked feeling of "tiredness". These episodes have increased in frequency and duration, persisting for several hours. No orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND) or oedema of the lower extremities. No associated chest pain at rest or on exertion. She has never presented syncopal or presyncopal symptoms. With the suspicion of recurrence of atrial fibrillation, in a first consultation, an electrocardiogram (ECG) in sinus rhythm was performed and the patient was again urged to use her ECG monitoring device when symptoms recurred. Similarly, a new, regular echocardiogram was requested.  Physical examination in consultation Good general condition, blood pressure (BP) 125/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80 bpm. Basal oxygen saturation 99%. Afebrile. Head and neck: no jugular venous engorgement. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic sounds at 75 bpm without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normoventilation in all fields. Abdomen: nondescript. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Initial ECG consultation: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, PR 170ms, narrow QRS with normal axis, without repolarisation alterations. Normal QTc. ECG tracings obtained with a closed loop recorder (Kardia), symptomatic and non-symptomatic: there were several recordings in sinus rhythm and increasingly frequent events labelled as possible atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. When analysing these recordings in detail, there is a clear RR irregularity and absence of P waves, highly suggestive of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. Echocardiogram (performed in sinus rhythm) (video 1): left atrium (LA) slightly dilated (AP diameter at PEL: 41 mm, Vol index: 40 ml/m2). Thin leaflet mitral valve with preserved mobility and opening; mild insufficiency. Diastolic pattern of impaired relaxation, with no increase in filling pressures (E/e ́septal=12). Left ventricle slightly dilated, not hypertrophied (IVS= 11 mm; LVED= 59 mm; PP= 10 mm) with moderately depressed systolic function (biplane LVEF 34%), due to diffuse involvement, without clear segmental alterations. Thin, trivalve aortic valve with good opening and mobility; normal flow (max. v. 1.2 m/s). Valvular annulus and aortic root of normal dimensions. Right ventricle not dilated; preserved contractility (TAPSE= 21 mm). Tricuspid valve with good opening and mobility; minimal regurgitation that does not allow estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPS). Inferior vena cava (IVC) not dilated. No evidence of pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion. Coronary and LA CT scan prior to AF ablation procedure: coronary calcium score 26. Non-invasive coronary angiography: epicardial coronary arteries without angiographically significant lesions. Left atrial study: slight left atrial dilatation (25 cm2). Four pulmonary veins are identified: two left pulmonary veins and two right pulmonary veins. The dimensions of the ostia are: IPSV 19x15 mm; IIPV 18.5x12.2 mm; DPSV 20x15.8 mm and IDPV 17.8x11.6 mm. The oesophagus is 3 mm from the posterior wall of the left venous trunk. There is no persistence of right superior vena cava. Transesophageal echocardiogram during ablation: absence of intracavitary thrombi and left atrial appendage with good flow measured by pulsed Doppler (v: 0.6 m/s). Atrial septum intact with no patent foramen ovale. Left ventricle with mildly moderate depression of contractile function. No pericardial effusion. A first manoeuvre was performed to approach the fossa ovalis with a puncture needle, locating a puncture site somewhat close to the aortic root. Due to this proximity, another approach manoeuvre is performed, placing the needle in a more posterior location (video 3). Finally, transseptal puncture was monitored and passed without complications.  Electrophysiological study and ablation:  Diagnostic mapping assessment of the LA: after effective electrical cardioversion, a detailed mapping of the left atrium is performed. This chamber is accessed via transseptal puncture. Using the navigation system and traversing a large number of points of the atrial wall with the catheter, a reproduction of the volume and geometry of the left atrium is obtained, representing it in three-dimensional form on a computer application that allows virtual mobility of the established geometry in all directions of space. A cartography map of the pulmonary veins is also drawn up using the same technique described above and labelled, establishing the existence of 4 pulmonary veins (2 left and 2 right). In the same way, the mitral valve annulus is conformed and labelled. Reconnection of the left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) was confirmed, and a pace and map manoeuvre was performed to locate the gap, which was finally located in the posterosuperior region of the LSPV. Voltage mapping of both atria was performed, with no areas of low voltage. A protocol was initiated to assess atrial fibrillation triggers not originating from pulmonary veins by infusion of isoproterenol at increasing doses until reaching 20 mcg/kg. Under this perfusion, frequent extrasystolic activity and small spurts of AT began, mapping early extrasystolic activity as a possible trigger of atrial fibrillation from the posterior roof of the left atrium and superior vena cava, where even an initiation of AF was recorded without catheter contact with the venous wall. Ablation procedure (temperature controlled up to 43 oC and 30W power). An LSI of 5 in posterior zones and 5.5 in anterior zones is limited. Two radiofrequency applications are performed in the posterosuperior region (better pace and map with a venous-atrial conduction time of 50 ms achieving bidirectional isolation in VPSI). Two lines of applications are performed, delimiting a box in the posterior roof, encompassing the focus of the left atrial roof that could not be delimited in its exact location, joining antral ablation lines of previous pulmonary veins that presented conduction block. A total of 21 applications were made between the two lines. Subsequently, electrical isolation was checked by blocking the outflow of this region. Next, in AD, a crown of applications is formed encompassing the superior vena cava, with a total of 27 applications (714 seconds). In applications of the external face of this venous antrum, stimulation is performed at maximum output prior to applications to ensure the absence of phrenic capture and minimise the risk of phrenic paralysis. Effective isolation of the vein is achieved after the last few applications inside the ablation line, in the area of greatest premature extrasystoles. Verification: after 30 minutes of waiting, isolation and blockage verification manoeuvres carried out previously are repeated, verifying the absence of acute reconnection and persistence of conduction blockage of previous isolation lines. By administering i.v. adenosine (12 mg), the absence of dormant conduction in the pulmonary veins and superior vena cava is verified. The catheters are removed, normal contractility of the cardiac silhouette is checked and the procedure is concluded.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION In the consultation for review of the results, the patient showed increasingly frequent and long-lasting ECG recordings in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The echocardiogram showed moderate systolic dysfunction due to diffuse involvement, but no segmental alterations in contractility. At the time of consultation, he was again in sinus rhythm, but with abundant supraventricular extrasystolic activity. Anticoagulant treatment was started with dabigatran 150 mg/12 h (CHA2DS2VASc score of 3 points (age 1, female 1 and heart failure or reduced LVEF 1 point) and antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone 200 mg/24 h, ramipril 2.5 mg/24 h and bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 h. It was first suspected that the left ventricular dysfunction could be caused by tachycardiomyopathy, and for this reason, together with the presence of symptomatic paroxysms of atrial fibrillation, a new ablation procedure was indicated. However, given the patient's age and history of ex-smoking and slight overweight, assessment of the coronary tree was considered. As the patient required a CT scan of the left atrium and pulmonary veins prior to ablation, this test was used for non-invasive coronary angiography, which showed no significant lesions in the coronary arteries. One month after starting anticoagulation and after discontinuation of antiarrhythmic medication, a second atrial fibrillation ablation procedure was performed. During the procedure, VPSI reconnection was verified, and the VPSI was isolated and checked again. Subsequently, triggers not originating from the pulmonary veins were sought by infusion of isoproterenol, locating a focus in the posterior roof of the left atrium, which was treated by performing a posterior roof box up to the venous antrum and another focus in the superior vena cava, which required circumferential isolation of the same. After the procedure, the patient presented no complications and, given her good evolution, she was discharged from hospital after 24 hours, previously restarting anticoagulant medication and her antiarrhythmic treatment. One month after ablation (still in the blanking period), the patient came for a check-up with evident clinical improvement, being in NYHA functional class I, and with no sensation of tachycardia. She provided ECG recordings which were all in sinus rhythm and in the echocardioscopy performed during the consultation, the LVEF had improved significantly and appeared to be preserved/borderline. A further consultation was scheduled 3 months after the ablation procedure.  DIAGNOSIS Paroxysmal AF in a patient with probable tachycardiomyopathy (absence of coronary artery disease on CT scan prior to ablation). Left superior pulmonary vein reconnection. Presence of extrapulmonary foci manifested by isoproterenol infusion in the posterior roof of the left atrium and superior vena cava. Radiofrequency ablation of reconnection and extrapulmonary foci with acute success (electrical isolation and electrogram ablation). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 43-year-old woman, with the following history: No known drug allergies. No known toxic habits or cardiovascular risk factors. Iron deficiency anaemia on intermittent treatment with oral iron. Anxiety-depressive syndrome, on anxiolytic treatment on demand. No family history of heart disease or early cardiovascular disease. Usual medication: folic acid 5 mg/24 h, lorazepam 1 mg (on demand).  Current illness Consultation due to an episode of oppressive central thoracic pain, with accompanying vegetative symptoms, which started abruptly while standing up while working in a kitchen at high temperature and associated with a great feeling of stress. On arrival at the hospital, with progressive clinical improvement, no electrocardiographic alterations suggestive of ischaemia or mobilisation of myocardial damage enzymes were recorded. He denied previous history of angina, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He reported progressive dyspnoea on moderate exertion of about 6 months' duration, without orthopnoea, oedema or reduced diuresis. Finally, it was decided to admit him to the cardiology department for further tests.  Physical examination Asymptomatic, normal colour, well perfused, without jugular ingurgitation or hepatojugular reflux.  Blood pressure (BP) 110/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80 bpm. Eupneic at basal saturation 99%. On auscultation, rhythmic heart tones, with systolic murmur II/VI panfocal but predominantly pulmonary, radiating to the carotids and more noticeably to the interscapular region. Abdomen: normal examination, with no pathological findings. Radial and pedial pulses symmetrically preserved. Absence of oedema.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram (ECG): RS at 57 bpm, normal axis, without atrioventricular (AV) or intraventricular conduction disorders, without repolarisation disorders.  Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index (CTI) at the upper limit of normality, with an increase in the pulmonary vascular pattern.  Laboratory tests: Initial blood tests (ED): hypochromic microcytic anaemia with haemoglobin 9.3 g/dl (similar to previous ones), MCV 84 fl, MCH 25.9 pg, rest of haemogram normal. Renal function, hepatobiliary profile and ions normal. Creatine phosphokinase normal. TnT 9-16 ng/l.  Analytical studies during admission (summary): Blood count: haemoglobin stable at around 10 g/dl, the rest without alterations. Deficiency profile: serum iron 67.20 g/dl, IST 19%, ferritin 13.70 g/l, transferrin 282.40 mg/dl, vitB12 normal, folic acid 2.4 g/l. Biochemistry: renal function ions and liver function markers normal. Metabolic and other profile: TSH normal. HbA1C 5.8%. Lipid profile normal. Normal acute phase reactants. Negative autoimmunity markers (RF, ANA, ANCA, C3, C4). ProBNP 167 pg/ml.  Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle (LV) slightly dilated by volumes (DTDVI 52 mm, BP vol 165 ml), not hypertrophied. Dilated left atrium indexed to body surface area (44 ml/m2). Normal right chambers. Aorta of normal calibre and flow in its accessible sections. Absence of significant valvulopathies. No evidence of pulmonary hypertension. An anomalous filling jet is visualised in the left atrium, eccentric, which crosses the interatrial septum and reaches the mitral valve, continuous, with a Vmax of 3.4 m/s. Normal LV systolic and diastolic function, without contractility alterations. Normofunctioning right ventricle. No pericardial effusion or other findings. Contrast-enhanced CT angiography of coronary arteries and aorta: coronary arteries normal, without lesions. Fistula from the descending thoracic aorta to the left atrium, with saccular dilatation of the right posterior wall. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): LV of normal diameter and morphology, with indexed end-diastolic volume of 78 ml/m2 (slightly dilated). Preserved LVEF, without segmental alterations of contractility. In cine sequences there was an evident aorto-atrial fistula (very fine jet at the level of the roof of the left atrium), the rest of the study with no significant findings.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION Given the clinical data and initial complementary tests, the probability of ischaemic heart disease was considered low. However, given the exploratory findings, congenital heart disease was suspected, and the echocardiographic study showed an anomalous filling jet in the left atrium. Angio-CT of the coronary arteries was requested, ruling out arteriosclerotic disease, but a fistulous tract of saccular morphology was found between the descending thoracic aorta and the left atrium, with a suspected genetic origin in the absence of surgical history, trauma, or semiology compatible with current or previous endocarditis. During her admission she remained asymptomatic and the single episode of chest pain was attributed to an anxiety crisis, as the location of the fistulous tract did not justify in this case a possible coronary steal phenomenon. The study was completed on an outpatient basis with CMR, confirming the findings already described by echocardiogram and coronary CT, with data of incipient remodelling of the left chambers (dilatation and hyperflow). For this reason, a consensus was reached at a medical-surgical meeting on endovascular repair by means of percutaneous implantation of a thoracic aortic stent, which was carried out without complications, with good sealing of the leak in the control angiography.  DIAGNOSIS Chest pain of multifactorial cause: anxiety crisis, hyperdynamic state. Angiographically normal coronary arteries by CT angiography. Left aorto-atrial fistula with evidence of incipient remodelling of the left cavities (dilatation and hyperflow). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  A 79-year-old woman attended the emergency department due to gait instability.  History Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): hypertension.

Chest X-ray: favourable radiological evolution of heart failure data. Cranial CT scan: no evidence of acute intracranial pathology in the post-traumatic context of the patient. Right frontal epicranial contusion/hematoma without bone fractures.  Echocardiogram: left ventricle not dilated, with normal wall thickness. Akinesia of middle and distal segments of all faces and apex. Hyperkinesia of the basal segments. Moderately depressed global systolic function. LVEF 30-35%. Pseudonormalised transmitral filling pattern. Slightly dilated left atrium. Right atrium not dilated. Aneurysm of the interatrial septum displaced towards the right atrium as an indirect sign of increased left atrial pressure. Right ventricle not dilated, with normal global systolic function. Rest normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): left ventricle: a) size and function: normal size, with normal thickness. Hypokinesia of the distal segments of all faces and apex. Basal segments are hypercontractile. Global left ventricular function at the lower limit of normality (LVEF 52%). b) T2-STIR: a hyperintense transmural zone affecting the middle and distal segments of all the faces is observed. c) First-pass perfusion: no alterations. d) Late enhancement: no alterations. Right ventricle: a) Size and function: normal size, not hypertrophic, normocontractile. b) T2-STIR: hyperintensity is observed at the level of the apical segment. c) Late enhancement: no alterations. Left atrium not dilated. Right atrium of normal size. Mitral valve with thin leaflets, normal opening. Aortic valve trivalve, functionally normal. Bilateral pleural effusion. Perihilar opacities more suggestive of heart failure. Conclusions: study compatible with stress cardiomyopathy (tako-tsubo syndrome). Data compatible with myocardial oedema affecting the middle and distal segments of the left ventricle, without evidence of late enhancement or segmental perfusion alterations. Global systolic function at the lower limit of normal (LVEF 52%). Coronary angiography: smooth coronary arteries.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient presented with instability in the context of severe hypoosmolar hyponatraemia (sodium 104 mml/l on admission) euvolaemic with normal urine osmolarity in the probable context of recent initiation of sertraline and potentiated by the concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride. Cranial CT scan with no acute findings. There was also associated hypomagnesaemia and hypokalaemia. In this context, he had an elevated troponin plateau (8500-->8400 ng/l), ECG with anterior QS and residual ST elevation and echocardiogram with previously unknown LVEF 35% and alterations in segmental contraction compatible with takotsubo syndrome/stress cardiomyopathy. Admission to cardiology for monitoring was decided. Sertraline was discontinued and intravenous sodium replacement with serotherapy was started, as well as oral potassium and magnesium replacement, with progressive improvement in natraemia without residual neurological focality. Coronary angiography ruled out obstructive coronary disease. Cardiopathy study was completed with findings compatible with stress cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30-35% on admission, which recovered to near normal (50-55%) on discharge. As the probable origin of the hydroelectrolytic disorder, the use of drugs (thiazides + SSRIs) + SIADH secondary to TCE (Na levels tested in September 2020, normal) is proposed. As a cause of the tako-tsubo syndrome, the main option is severe hyponatraemia present on admission associated with creaneoencephalic trauma.  At discharge asymptomatic, afebrile, haemodynamically stable, with sodium of 139 mmol/l. Follow-up in the cardiology day hospital, with normalisation of ventricular function and asymptomatic.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 50-year-old male patient, independent for basic activities of daily living and without cognitive impairment. Single, lives alone in a small town in our autonomous community. Cardiovascular risk factors: ex-smoker for 2 years, with an accumulated consumption of 30 packets/year, ex-drinker for 6 months with a previous daily consumption of 5-6 UBE/d. No known metabolic disorders. Cardiological history: no cardiological history of interest. No family history of heart disease or sudden death. Other history: no personal history of note. Treatment: no chronic home treatment. Occasional use of NSAIDs.  Current illness The patient consulted his regional referral hospital due to a fever and general malaise of 15 days' duration accompanied by inflammatory pain in the lumbar region. He also presented with slightly localised abdominal discomfort, with an accompanying feeling of nausea. No other infectious symptoms at any other level. No chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitations or other cardiological symptoms. During her stay in the emergency department, tests were started with laboratory tests and abdominal ultrasound. The biochemistry showed elevated inflammatory markers, the haemogram showed leukocytosis with left shift and the abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly measuring 18 cm with multiple cystic formations inside. For this reason, a thoracoabdominal CT scan was requested which confirmed the presence of multiple splenic and renal infarctions. Finally, following these findings, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which revealed the presence of severe aortic insufficiency of uncertain origin, without being able to confirm the presence of warts. On the basis of these studies, and given the suspicion of infective endocarditis, empirical antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone and ampicillin. After 24 h of admission, and following the growth of Enterococcus faecalis in the blood cultures, it was decided to discuss the case with the cardiology department of our hospital in order to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram, as well as to complete the studies and assess definitive treatment. The patient arrived at our hospital haemodynamically stable, with very mild respiratory work, and with basal crackles, as well as petechiae in the lower limbs as the most relevant findings of the examination. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram was performed with a result similar to that obtained at his regional hospital, and it was decided to complete the cardiological studies.  Physical examination Vitals: heart rate (HR) 92 bpm; respiratory rate (RR) 29 rpm; blood pressure (BP) 95/48; oxygen saturation 97%. Patient conscious, oriented and cooperative. Good hydration status. Slight skin pallor. No pain gesture. Mild tachypnoea at rest, no intercostal tugging. Head and neck: no jugular ingurgitation and negative hepatojugular reflux. Carotid pulse symmetrical and no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur with crepitant rales in the right base. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds. Aortic systolic murmur II/VI with preserved 2nd sound followed by a protodiastolic murmur II/IV. Abdomen: no skin lesions or scars. Preserved hydro-aerial sounds. Soft and depressible, without discomfort on palpation or rebound. Palpable splenomegaly. Lower extremities: extremities warm and with good capillary filling. Petechial lesions on both legs. Radial and pedial pulses present and symmetrical. No signs of chronic venous insufficiency, no oedema and no signs suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Biochemistry: glucose 113 mg/dl, urea 59 mg/dl, creatinine 1.45 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate 53 ml/min/1.78 m2, sodium ion 137 mmol/l, potassium ion 4.1 mmol/l, C-reactive protein 17.2 mg/dl; procalcitonin 1.56 ng/ml; NT-proBNP 3.280pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase 107 U/l, AST 21 U/l, ALT 24 U/l, GGT 59 U/l, total bilirubin < 1.0 mg/dl, total cholesterol 126 mg/dl, HDL 10 mg/dl, triglycerides 281 mg/dl, calculated LDL cholesterol 47 mg/dl, HbA1C 4.6%, TSH 2.03 mU/l. CBC: haemoglobin 8.1 g/dl, haematocrit %, red blood cells 2.86x106/μl, leukocytes 10,520/μl, neutrophils 8,760/μl, lymphocytes 1,150/μl, monocytes 530/μl, eosinophils 70/μL, basophils 10/μl, platelets 235,000/μl. Coagulation: prothrombin time (PT) 15.10 sec; partial thromboplastin time (PTAT) 33.70 sec; INR 1.33; derived fibrinogen: 491 mg/l. Blood cultures: growth of Gram + cocci in the first 24 hours. At 72 h the presence of Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin was confirmed. 12-lead ECG performed on arrival at our hospital: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm. P wave of normal size and morphology. PR interval in range without prolongation. Narrow QRS with axis between 0-90o and transition between V3-V4. ST segment without suprathresholds. Normal T wave. QTc interval in normal range. Chest X-ray performed on arrival at our hospital: cardiac silhouette of normal size. Slight vascular redistribution towards apical lung fields suggestive of incipient pulmonary congestion. No pinching of the costophrenic sinuses suggestive of pleural effusion. No parenchymal condensation or pneumothorax. Abdominal ultrasound performed in a regional hospital prior to transfer to our centre: hepatic steatosis without focal lesions. Biliary tract without lesions. Kidneys normal. Pancreas not assessable. Spleen 18cm with cystic formations inside. Empty bladder not assessable. Thoracoabdominal CT scan performed in a regional hospital prior to transfer to our centre: no pulmonary nodules or thoracic adenopathies in pathological range or appearance were observed. Small tongue of bilateral pleural effusions. Hypodense lesions of triangular splenic morphology suggestive of infarction, as well as right renal lesions also probably related to infarction. Diffuse hepatic steatosis with cystic lesion in the LHI. Pancreas, adrenal glands are normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed in a regional hospital prior to transfer to our centre: left ventricle neither dilated (VTD 128 ml, VTS 39 ml) nor hypertrophic, without segmental alterations and with preserved LVEF (LVEF 69% by Simpson biplane). Left atrium slightly dilated (AP diameter 43 mm). Right ventricle of normal size and function (TAPSE 26 mm). Mild tricuspid insufficiency with a velocity of 3.22 m/s (PSAP 44 mmHg). Inferior vena cava not dilated. High probability of pulmonary hypertension. Mitral valve with thin leaflets without prolapse, mild mitral regurgitation. Trivalve aortic valve, leaflets appear thin and there are no images suggestive of endocarditis. Central aortic insufficiency which appears severe (THP 112/m/s, VC 7-8 mm), without being able to determine the mechanism. Aortic root not dilated. No suprasternal or good visualisation of the abdominal aorta to assess the presence of diastolic reverse flow. No pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE): the atrial septum is intact, with no evidence of atrial septal defect. Mitral valve: vegetation in the anterior mitral leaflet, about 6mm long axis; moderate mitral insufficiency is detected. Tricuspid valve normal in structure and function. Trivalve aortic valve; endocarditis on the aortic valve, with a wart of about 11 mm of major axis, with destruction of the non-coronary leaflet, leading to severe aortic insufficiency. No evidence of perivalvular involvement. There is no pericardial effusion. Cardiac CT scan: trivalve aortic valve with focal thickening of the non-coronary leaflet and a 10 mm polypoid image, mobile, close to the implantation point in relation to the clinical suspicion of endocarditis. Rupture of the non-coronary leaflet. No perivalvular complications were identified. Coronary arteries without significant lesions. CT scan of the brain: hyperdense image in the left subcortical sylvian region with discrete surrounding oedema, without significant mass effect, which in the clinical context of the patient suggests a small haemorrhagic embolus, without being able to rule out underlying abscess due to the fact that the study was performed without VSD. No alterations in the density of the brain parenchyma suggestive of subacute ischaemic pathology were observed. Area of encephalomalacia in the right temporal pole with discrete exvacuo dilatation of the homolateral horn, of residual appearance; we do not know the patient's clinical and traumatic history. Discrete signs of chronic small vessel pathology in the base ganglia, no bone lesions of interest are observed. Positron emission tomography with 18F-deoxyglucose (PETTC): head and neck without pathological alterations of the glycemic metabolism. A focus of mild glycemic hypermetabolism is observed adjacent to the aortic valve area (SUVmax 2.83), which could be related to known endocarditis (the low degree of uptake could be explained by response to antibiotic treatment). No other hypermetabolic foci were detected in the valvular heart area suggestive of endocarditis. Splenomegaly with the presence of several extensive ametabolic lesions, which show increased glycemic metabolism in their periphery (SUVmax 8.27), with fairly homogeneous characteristics, related to known splenic infarcts, without clear signs suggestive of their superinfection. The hypermetabolism could be explained, at least in part, by extramedullary haematopoiesis secondary to known anaemia. Liver, pancreas, adrenal glands and mesentery without pathological alterations of glycemic metabolism. Kidneys not assessable due to physiological excretion of radiotracer. Diffuse and homogeneous increase in metabolism in the bone marrow, probably related to anaemia. Rest of the study with no findings of interest. Cerebral angio-MRI: in the FLAIR sequence, multiple patchy hyperintensities of bilateral subcortical cortical location and in the right cerebellar hemisphere are observed, with a more extensive area in the right temporal pole, which show late enhancement after contrast. They are compatible with infarcts of cardioembolic origin, several of them with signs of petechial microbleeding, in a subacute-late phase evolving to chronicity. A 10 mm haematoma in the left sylvian region with discrete perilesional oedema, which has not increased with respect to previous CT studies. In the magnetic susceptibility sequence at least 3 millimetric formations are identified in convexity grooves (bilateral frontal and right occipital), not assessable in the angio-MRI, not being able to rule out distal mycotic aneurysms. No significant alterations were seen at the level of the polygon of Willis. No lesions suggestive of abscesses are identified. Cerebral arteriography: identified by arteriography from the left ICA as a pseudoaneurysm in M2 branch, embolised using a sandwich technique with coils distal and proximal to the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. Good final angiographic result.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION During the first days of admission, a transesophageal echocardiography was performed, as well as a cardiac CT scan, which confirmed the presence of aortic vegetation with involvement of the non-coronary leaflet, with rupture of the same, leading to severe aortic insufficiency. In addition, data suggestive of a previously undescribed vegetation at the mitral level and coronary arteries without lesions were also observed. With these findings, it was decided to discuss the case in a multidisciplinary endocarditis session, with the participation of the radiology, infectious diseases and cardiac surgery departments, with a view to assessing valve replacement. Given the history of splenic infarction, it was decided to request extension studies prior to surgery to rule out embolisms at other levels and to re-evaluate the state of spleen involvement. On the same day, a cranial CT scan was performed which showed the presence of a haemorrhagic lesion in the region of Sylvius compatible with the rupture of a mycotic aneurysm and a PET-CT scan showed marked splenic involvement, with large necrotic areas. At this point, with the presence of valvular involvement, splenomegaly with multiple areas of large infarction, and intracranial bleeding, it was decided jointly with the neurology, cardiac surgery and general surgery services to establish an order of action to treat the set of complications developed by the patient. Initially, an arteriography with embolisation of the mycotic aneurysm affecting the M2 branch of the left middle cerebral artery was performed (after study with cerebral angio-MRI). The procedure was performed without incident and without secondary neurological sequelae. Subsequently, it was decided to perform a splenectomy. The reason for initially resecting the spleen rather than the heart was to avoid the risk of bleeding that could have been caused by the extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and subsequent heparinisation. One week after embolisation, splenectomy by laparotomy was performed without complications. Finally, three days after the splenectomy, the patient underwent surgery for his valve disease. The aortic valve was resected and a St. Jude No. 23 biological prosthesis was implanted. It is noteworthy that during the operation: both the intraoperative TEE and the visual inspection did not reveal the mitral involvement described in the previous report; only a grade II/IV mitral insufficiency, so it was decided not to operate on it (the same grade was maintained at the discharge control). During admission, the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics according to the recommendations of the infectious diseases department (ceftriaxone, gentamicin and ampicillin). The patient's evolution during the first weeks of admission was acceptably good. The patient remained practically asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view, with development of mild heart failure (but good clinical tolerance) and improvement in both fever and digestive symptoms. The main complications were marked anaemia, which required repeated transfusions of several red blood cell concentrates. On the other hand, he also had a deterioration of renal function that made it necessary to space contrast studies and maintain adequate hydration. After the two surgeries, the patient remained in hospital for a little over a month, with a very poor evolution due to complications derived from his abdominal surgery. This even necessitated reoperation for drainage of the abdominal abscess and the patient's admission to the chronic wound unit for management of the laparotomy incision. In the end, however, the patient can be discharged home to continue his recovery there.  DIAGNOSIS Acute E. faecalis endocarditis on native aortic valve.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 71-year-old patient, no known allergies. Ex-smoker for 2 years (EA 40 packs/year). Cardiovascular risk factors include high blood pressure, insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus with good control and dyslipidaemia. Cardiological history includes permanent atrial fibrillation. The last echocardiography in 2016 showed LVEF 52%, mild mitral regurgitation and estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPS) of 35 mmHg. Patient in NYHA functional class II, with no previous admissions for heart failure. The main comorbidity was chronic renal failure being monitored by nephrology and with baseline creatinine levels around 1.5-2 mg/dl (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 40 ml/min/1.73 m2), peripheral vascular disease with intermittent claudication and multifactorial anaemia with endoscopic study within normal limits. Usual medication: acenocoumarol, manidipine 10 mg/day, doxazosin 8 mg/day, furosemide 40 mg/day, atorvastatin 40 mg/day, insulin glargine 18U, ferroglycine sulphate 100 mg/d; darbepoetin alfa 1 injection/week.  Present illness The patient came to the emergency department in February 2020 due to an increase in his baseline dyspnoea of 1 week's evolution to minimal effort accompanied by orthopnoea and oedematisation of the lower limbs together with a subjective decrease in diuresis. Since then, he has had rapid palpitations. As a triggering factor, he presented with a cough with scanty whitish expectoration without fever, of 10 days' evolution, for which his primary care physician had prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125 mg/8 h for 7 days.  Physical examination Vital signs: blood pressure (BP) 175/83 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 120 bpm, baseline oxygen saturation 88%. Cardiac auscultation with irregular, tachycardic sounds.

Dilated left atrium. Provocation of ischaemia with negative regadenoson. Absence of myocardial necrosis. Intramyocardial fibrosis in the entire basal septum and in the area of intersection of the right ventricle in the medial septum.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted for decompensated heart failure in the context of respiratory infection and rapid atrial fibrillation. On admission, impaired renal function and mild hyperkalaemia were observed. Imaging tests showed dilated cardiomyopathy of non-ischaemic origin with moderately depressed LVEF and borderline right function, without significant valvular heart disease. Intravenous diuretic treatment was administered, with clinical improvement, and the patient was discharged from hospital. Bisoprolol 2.5 mg/day, valsartan 40 mg/day and furosemide was increased to 80 mg/day. Subsequently, the patient made two visits to the emergency department for heart failure, and intravenous diuretics were administered without requiring admission, and the oral diuretic regimen was adjusted. In August the patient was admitted again for decompensation of heart failure and severe hyperkalaemia. Blood tests showed creatinine 2.24 mg/dl, GFR 28.4 ml/min/1.73 m2, Na+ 141 mmol/l, K+ 6.7 mmol/l, NT-proBNP 24.5011 pg/ml, CA125 240 U/ml. After depletive treatment and correction of hyperkalaemia on discharge, chlorthalidone 25 mg every other day and resincalcium were added to his treatment and he was referred to the heart failure unit of our centre. On the first visit, the patient was in NYHA functional class III with significant orthopnoea. Laboratory tests showed creatinine 2.97 (eGFR 20 ml/min/1.73 m2) and K+ 5.7 mmol/l. Treatment was started with patiromer 16.8 g/day and a subcutaneous furosemide pump was prescribed. At the next visit the patient had a creatinine of 2.74 mg/dl (eGFR 23 ml/min/1.73 m2) and K+ of 4.2 mmol/l. It was then decided to add sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg/12h. In November, he was admitted twice more for heart failure due to recurrent bilateral pleural effusion, predominantly on the right, which required several thoracentesis and finally the placement of a permanent pleural drainage. At the follow-up visit in December, the patient reported improvement in functional class (NYHA II) and orthopnoea, with no signs of congestion. Laboratory tests showed an improvement in renal function (creatinine 2.5 mg/dl, eGFR 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) and K+ 3.6 mmol/l. To date, the patient remains in good functional class, with no new episodes of heart failure decompensation, and pleural drainage has been removed due to the absence of debit. Images 4, 5, 6 and 7 show the evolution of creatinine, potassium and prognostic and congestion biomarkers NT-proBNP and CA125 during the patient's evolution.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure with reduced LVEF. Non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Chronic renal disease. Cardiorenal syndrome. Hyperkalaemia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Conclusions: focus of hypermetabolism in aortic valve prosthesis suggestive of endocarditis, with reactive mediastinal and pulmonary adenopathies. Circumferential mural thrombosis of the abdominal aorta and partial obstruction of the right common iliac artery.  CLINICAL COURSE In the case of a patient with a conduction disorder presenting with exertional dyspnoea and dizziness, it was decided to admit him to cardiology to complete the study. A new exercise stress test was requested to assess the reaction to exercise, and an adequate chronotropic response and 1:1 conduction was observed throughout the test. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which ruled out prosthetic dysfunction, without observing segmental contractility alterations suggestive of ischaemia. After the absence of relevant findings in the examinations performed, it was decided to discharge the patient from hospital with withdrawal of beta-blockers. Given the persistence of atypical chest pain with a history of previous coronary artery disease, stress CMR was brought forward with outpatient monitoring in cardiology outpatient clinics. The following week a stress CMR was performed, with negative results for ischaemia, but a periprosthetic collection with contrast uptake was found, of uncertain significance, which could correspond to postoperative inflammatory activity or an infectious process. On assessing the results, taking into account the remoteness of the intervention (> 3 years) and given the possibility of infective prosthetic endocarditis, it was decided to readmit the patient to cardiology to complete the study and start antibiotic treatment. Empirical treatment with ampicillin, cloxacillin and gentamicin was started in agreement with the infectious diseases unit. Blood cultures and serology for endocarditis were requested, with negative results. It was decided to complete the imaging study with PET-CT, which showed the presence of hypermetabolism in the aortic valve prosthesis suggestive of endocarditis, with reactive mediastinal and pulmonary adenopathies; as an incidental finding, a circumferential mural thrombosis of the abdominal aorta and partial obstruction of the right common iliac artery were found. With the above findings, the case was discussed in a joint medical-surgical session between cardiology, cardiac surgery and the infectious diseases unit. Since the patient was stable, with no evidence of prosthetic dysfunction or acute complications, initial antibiotic treatment was chosen for 6 weeks, changing the previous regimen to daptomycin, ceftriaxone and doxycycline, with subsequent re-evaluation. After the first 10 days of treatment, the patient remained clinically stable, and it was decided to discharge him to the home hospitalisation unit (HHU) to complete the antibiotic regimen. Also, with a history of coronary heart disease and the finding of peripheral arterial disease with mural thrombosis of the abdominal aorta, lipid-lowering treatment was intensified with the addition of a combination of atorvastatin/ezetimibe. After 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy, a new control PET-CT scan was performed, in which periprosthetic hypermetabolism persisted but of less intensity than previously, with disappearance of the reactive adenopathies. With the good response to treatment, it was decided to complete 4 more weeks of antibiotic treatment, replacing doxycycline with rifampicin, which would subsequently be maintained in monotherapy until completing 6 months of treatment.  DIAGNOSIS Late infective endocarditis on biological aortic prosthesis. First-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) secondary to aortic endocarditis. Circumferential mural thrombosis of the abdominal aorta. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Diastolic dysfunction grade II, psudonormalised pattern (E/A 1.8 E/e" 17). Severe mitral insufficiency, dilated left atrium (50 mm). Right ventricle of preserved dimensions and systolic function, estimated PAPS 52 mmHg. Reduced global longitudinal Strain, preserved in apical segments, with deterioration in the basal region. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): anterior ascending (AD) area in 4C 25 cm2, right ventricle (RV) 76X46X52 mm. Left atrium (LA) area 28 cm2, left ventricle (LV) 50X40X69 mm. T1 non-enhanced. Interventricular septum 19.5 mm, slight circumferential pericardial effusion of subcentimetric thickness. Non-dilated left ventricle, with severe septal hypertrophy and moderate circumferential hypertrophy at baso-medial level, contractility without segmental deficits. After i.v. contrast, difficulty in myocardial signal cancellation in LL sequence, showing diffuse endocardial enhancement of basal predominance, almost transmural in basal lateral face and mid-apical transmural mottling, with some respect for the basal septum. Probable endocardial enhancement in left atrium. Slightly hypertrophic right ventricle with tricuspid insufficiency (TI), mitral insufficiency (MI) and LVOT acceleration jet, without clear SAM. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): broad-based bony overgrowth affecting the posterior wall of the left internal auditory canal, compatible with exostosis. Pyrophosphate cardiac scan: Perugini grade 1 uptake. Abdominal subcutaneous cellular tissue biopsy: no relevant lesions, Congo red negative. Bone marrow biopsy: Congo red negative, slightly hypercellular with mature forms of the three series and mild-moderate interstitial plasmacytosis (21-24%) and restriction of kappa light chains.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the internal medicine department for symptoms compatible with community-acquired pneumonia with associated small pleural effusion. Antibiotics were administered with ceftriaxone plus clarithromycin for 7 days, with partial improvement of cough, but still with persistent dyspnoea, orthopnoea and development of oedema in the lower limbs. A control chest X-ray showed a slight increase in pleural effusion. In addition, blood tests showed an elevation of NT-proBNP disproportionate to the clinical picture. Following the findings observed in the echocardiogram, cardiology assessment was requested and the patient was transferred to the cardiology department. During admission to the cardiology ward, the patient remained stable, but persisted with occasional dizziness and oedema in the lower limbs despite diuretic treatment. The echocardiogram showed symmetric concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle associated with diastolic dysfunction, high filling pressures and altered strain. In the aetiological study of the condition, CMR was performed with findings highly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis. To establish a differential diagnosis between AL cardiac amyloidosis and ATTR, pyrophosphate scintigraphy was performed, which showed mild myocardial uptake, as well as a proteinogram and immunofixation in blood and urine, which detected a monoclonal IgA kappa-type component. Abdominal fat biopsy with Congo red stain was negative for amyloidosis. Bone marrow biopsy was then performed with plasmacytosis greater than 20%. These findings were compatible with multiple myeloma. Finally, a salivary gland biopsy was performed and was positive for amyloidosis. The patient was transferred to haematology and started treatment with bortezomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone protocol.  DIAGNOSIS Acute heart failure with preserved LVEF. AL cardiac amyloidosis. Multiple myeloma IgA kappa. Community-acquired pneumonia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History The case is a 37-year-old woman, with no known drug allergies, a former smoker for 20 years, who in 2016 presented with central retinal vein obstruction, complicated by vitreous haemorrhage that eventually required vitrectomy. In addition, she has a probable antiphospholipid syndrome, for which she is being treated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/24 h and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24 h. The patient was being followed up by a private cardiologist due to the accidental finding of a murmur during an examination at work. The echocardiogram (TTE) showed moderate aortic insufficiency (AIo) with mild stenosis, normal mitral valve, non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pregnant at 20 weeks, she was referred from obstetrics for cardiology follow-up during pregnancy. Monthly follow-ups were started to rule out the appearance of cardiac decompensation. Special attention was paid to the appearance of congestive symptoms or signs: the patient only reported dyspnoea on moderate exertion. Serial analyses were performed, including NT-proBNP, which was normal, and TTE, which showed a non-dilated LV with normal LVEF, severe mitral (MR) and aortic insufficiency, with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. The patient had presented proteinuria since early gestation. At around week 30, she started with arterial hypertension (AHT), with blood pressure around 140/72 mmHg, plateletopenia and incipient oedema.  Present illness In week 34 she was referred to the obstetrics emergency department for high blood pressure of 168/84 mmHg: complementary tests showed proteinuria and plateletopenia, so it was decided to admit her for pulmonary maturation and observation on suspicion of possible pre-eclampsia versus alterations secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome.  Initially, vaginal delivery was attempted (because it was associated with less blood loss and less risk of infection and venous thromboembolism), but due to the risk of loss of foetal well-being, caesarean section was finally indicated. The patient had remained stable from a cardiological point of view during admission, but 12 hours after the caesarean section, cardiology was notified due to desaturation up to 77%. The patient only reported having started, while at rest, with a feeling of warmth and dizziness, without loss of consciousness, clear dyspnoea, orthopnoea or chest pain. Physical examination She was conscious and oriented, well perfused, blood pressure (BP) 160/90 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 75 bpm and oxygen saturation (SO2) 91-92% with oxygen therapy with nasal goggles (NG) at 2 l/min, eupneic at rest and tolerating decubitus. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic with diastolic and systolic murmur. Pulmonary auscultation in the anterior plane: preserved vesicular murmur. Slight oedema with pretibial fovea similar to that of that morning.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Laboratory tests: hypoxaemia with hypocapnia, with normal pH and lactic acid, mild renal failure with ions in range, NT-proBNP of 1466 ng/dl, and leukocytes with left deviation and CRP of 75 mg/l. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, with a normal PR and a narrow QRS without repolarisation alterations. Echocardioscopy: non-dilated and non-hypertrophic LV with preserved LVEF, without alterations in segmental contractility. Aortic root not dilated. Trivalve aortic valve, with thickened leaflets, especially at the level of the free edge, which generates a central coaptation deficit, resulting in severe AoI and mild stenosis. Mitral valve with diffusely thickened leaflets, with involvement of the subvalvular apparatus that restricts the movement of the posterior leaflet generating moderate-severe MR, directed towards the lateral wall of the left atrium and with a Coanda effect. Right ventricle normal in size and function. Tricuspid valve of normal appearance, without tricuspid insufficiency. No evidence of pulmonary hypertension. No pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After a joint assessment with gynaecology and resuscitation, it was decided to transfer the patient for a computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed extensive bilateral alveolar consolidations and septal thickening affecting both lungs, suggestive of bilateral pneumonia. Mild bilateral pleural effusion. In addition, a small repletion defect was identified in a segmental branch of the left lower lobe, compatible with pulmonary thromboembolism, without overload of the right heart chambers. During the CT scan, the patient presented intense dyspnoea without desaturation, which improved with sitting and increased oxygen therapy. In view of the findings of the complementary tests, it was decided to admit her to resuscitation for treatment of the suspected bilateral pneumonia, in addition to diuretic treatment to force a negative water balance. During her stay, she had a very good clinical evolution, with very abundant diuresis, resolution of dyspnoea, and improvement in SO2 that allowed her to de-escalate from oxygen therapy with high-flow glasses (HFG) to NG, and later withdrawal of the same, so that the picture was more likely to be one of acute heart failure (HF). The patient was discharged to the obstetrics ward after 48 hours in resuscitation, where she presented a good clinical evolution with resolution of the congestive semiology, and was finally discharged. Since her discharge, the patient has continued to undergo cardiological check-ups, initially more closely, which have been spaced out to be performed every three months. Her blood pressure remains practically normal, and the clinical signs of heart failure have completely resolved: she has no dyspnoea, orthopnoea or oedema, which has allowed complete suspension of the diuretic without the need to reintroduce it. The last echocardiogram showed severe aortic insufficiency with moderate-severe mitral insufficiency and preserved biventricular function. The decompensation that occurred during the puerperium was interpreted in the context of the haemodynamic changes that occur during pregnancy, so for the time being a wait-and-see attitude is maintained with close clinical and echocardiographic monitoring.  DIAGNOSIS Preeclampsia (gestational hypertension + severity criteria - thrombopenia). Acute pulmonary oedema, favoured by severe mitral and aortic insufficiency, with preserved LVEF. Antiphospholipid syndrome (carrier of lupus anticoagulant and B2-glycoprotein, with thrombotic episodes). |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 59-year-old woman. No cardiovascular risk factors or previous pathological history. No chronic treatment.   Present illness On 8 March the patient was giving a speech at a rally for Women's Day. Suddenly and before she could finish reading her manifesto, she suffered a sudden syncopal episode, without prodromes and with spontaneous recovery after a few seconds. On regaining consciousness she presented with epigastric pain radiating to the left hemithorax with associated vegetative cortex. The patient had no palpitations or dyspnoea prior to syncope. Unable to finish her speech, she was referred to the emergency department for assessment.  Physical examination Blood pressure 104/60 mmHg, heart rate 75 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry 97% on room air. Afebrile. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. Eupneic at rest, tolerates decubitus. No jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: regular, rhythmic heart sounds, no murmurs or pathological sounds. Pulmonary auscultation: normal ventilation in all lung fields. Abdomen: soft, depressible, non-painful, without megaliths. Lower extremities: no oedema, distal pulses present.    COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Electrocardiogram on admission: sinus bradycardia at 58 bpm. Normal PR. Narrow QRS, normal axis at -10o. ST segment elevation of 1mm in V5-V6. QTc 388 ms. Electrocardiogram at discharge: sinus bradycardia at 44 bpm. Normal PR, narrow QRS, axis at 0o. Negative T wave in V4-V6, I and aVL, II; flat T wave in III and aVF. QTc 391 ms. Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. No alveolar consolidation or pleural effusion. Laboratory tests: biochemistry: normal thyroid function. Creatinine 0.57 mg/dl. Total cholesterol 225 mg/dl (HDL 31 mg/dl; LDL 176 mg/dl). Serum total bilirubin 0,59 mg/dl. Total proteins 6.1 g/dl, albumin 3 g/dl. Chlorine 108 mEq/l, potassium 4.7 mEq/l, sodium 141 mEq/l. CK 138 U/l, FA 87 U/l, GGT 19 U/l, GOT 32 U/l, GPT 13 U/l, LDH 158 U/l. Glycosylated haemoglobin 5.5%. Troponin I 4,468 ng/l (normal < 11.6 ng/l), proBNP 1,909 pg/ml. Haemogram: leucocytes 5000/mm3 (N 2,600/mm3; L 1,900/mm3), haemoglobin 14.2 g/dl, platelets 171,000/mm3.  Cardiac catheterisation: Coronary angiography: right dominance. Left common trunk without angiographic stenosis. Anterior descending (AD) with angiographically mildly moderate stenosis in the proximal third, the rest of the main vessel has no angiographic stenosis. Rest of vessels without angiographic stenosis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed on the LAD, which in the proximal segment showed a minimal luminal area of 4.22 mm2 with integrity of the endothelium despite plaque burden. Functional assessment shows RFR 0.93, after hyperemia with i.v. adenosine FFR 0.90 and microcirculation study shows CFR 2 and IMR 44: evidence of microvascular dysfunction. Ventriculography shows a left ventricle (LV) of normal size with akinesia of all apical segments and hypercontractility of the basal segments. No intraventricular or aortic transvalvular gradient was detected.  Cardiac magnetic resonance: findings compatible with takotsubo syndrome. Diffuse hypersignal indicating the presence of oedema in the middle segments, apical segments and apex segment in T2-weighted T2-weighted TSE-FAT SAT sequences in short axis and two chambers. Absence of late gadolinium enhancement. Currently no apical dyskinesia is identified (with synchronous and homogeneous contractility), left ventricular ejection fraction 71%. No associated apical thrombus is observed. Right ventricle (RV) with normal function.  Echocardiogram at discharge: left ventricle of normal size and thickness. Left ventricular ejection fraction normal, without contractile asymmetries. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure data not elevated. Right ventricle normal in structure and function. Mitral valve normal in structure and function with minimal insufficiency. Normal tricuspid valve, with minimal tricuspid insufficiency allowing estimation of a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PSAP) of 25 mmHg. Trivalve aortic valve. The aortic root is of normal size. There is no pericardial effusion.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was referred to the emergency department of our hospital, where an electrocardiogram was performed, showing ST segment elevation of 1 mm in the lower lateral face. It was decided to perform emergent coronary angiography. Cardiac catheterisation revealed a coronary tree with no lesions, except for angiographically mild-moderate stenosis in the proximal LAD. To assess the stenosis of the LAD, it was decided to perform an optical coherence tomography (OCT) study. The OCT showed a luminal area greater than 4 mm2 with integrity of the endothelium. The haemodynamic study was completed with an assessment of the microcirculation showing microvascular dysfunction with a low coronary flow reserve (CFR) and a high microvascular resistance index (MRI). Ventriculography was performed, showing akinesia of the apical segments with hypercontractility of the basal segments; all highly suggestive of tako-tsubo syndrome. The patient was admitted haemodynamically stable and pain-free to the cardiac intermediate care unit. She progressed favourably, with no new chest pain, no signs of heart failure and no arrhythmic events. Electrocardiographically, there was a progressive negativisation of the T wave in the anterolateral and inferior face. The study was completed with a cardiac MRI scan showing oedema in the middle and apical segments with absence of late gadolinium enhancement, findings compatible with tako-tsubo syndrome. Prior to discharge, an echocardiogram was performed showing recovery of myocardial contractility. In view of the good evolution, hospital discharge was decided with treatment with bisoprolol 2.5 mg every 24 hours, enalapril 2.5 mg every 24 hours and atorvastatin 40 mg every 24 hours.  DIAGNOSIS Tako-tsubo syndrome. Microvascular dysfunction. Global and segmental left ventricular systolic function recovered at discharge. Mild-moderate atherosclerotic lesion in the anterior descending artery without functional repercussions. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History 54-year-old woman. No known allergies. No cardiovascular risk factors or toxic habits. Bilateral pneumonia due to COVID-19, requiring hospital admission and treatment with high-dose corticoid. During admission she reported lumbar pain and was diagnosed by CT scan with a fracture of L2, being treated conservatively. She was discharged 4 days before the current episode. On treatment with omeprazole 20 mg every 24 hours, dexamethasone 2 mg every 24 hours, metamizole 575 mg every 8 hours if required due to pain and enoxaparin 40 mg every 24 hours.

Lumbar MRI: study compatible with L2-L3 infectious spondylodiscitis with involvement of L3 and, to a lesser extent, L2, and right anterior peridural extension and L3, right L2-L3 and L3-L4 foraminal extension with potential effect on the emerging roots. Abscesses in both psoas, multiple on each side, with the largest one on the right side reaching 7.5 cms. Laboratory tests at discharge: CRP 1.43, creatinine 0.66 mg/dl, urea 42 mg/dl, cholesterol 175 mg/dl, chlorine 102 mEq/l, sodium 137 mEq/l, potassium 4.5 mEq/l, albumin 3.2 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 75 U/l, GGT 59 U/l, GOT 14 U/l, GPT 12 U/l, LDH 156. Leukocytes 6,500/ μl, haemoglobin 10.3 g/dl, platelets 265,000/ μl, ESR 76.  CLINICAL COURSE The patient was initially seen in the emergency department of our hospital. Given the signs of heart failure predominantly on the right and the central thoracic pain, together with the elevation of acute phase reactants in the laboratory tests, it was decided to admit the patient for further investigation. During her stay in the ED, the patient presented a peak fever of 38.2oC and blood cultures were taken. The echocardiogram on admission showed severe pericardial effusion with signs of echocardiographic repercussions, but no clinical signs at that time. Blood cultures showed growth of SAMS. Suspicion of purulent pericarditis led to subxiphoid pericardial drainage and antibiotic therapy was started with cefazolin and daptomycin. Pericardial fluid cultures were sterile but the biochemical characteristics of the fluid were infectious. The patient's symptoms did not clearly improve despite drainage of the pericardial fluid, so a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was requested to rule out the presence of endocarditis and to evaluate the progression of the effusion. This TEE showed constrictive physiology data suggestive of effusive-constrictive pericarditis. In addition to the cardiorespiratory symptoms, the patient presented pain in the upper lumbar region, both shoulders and left lower extremity. In view of the suspicion of septic foci, the study was completed with thoracoabdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging of both shoulders and lumbar region. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of septic arthritis in both shoulders, spondylodiscitis at L2-L3 and multiple abscesses in bilateral psoas. The patient also presented a lesion on the left lower extremity compatible with cellulitis.  Due to the persistence of fever, despite targeted antibiotherapy, the abscesses in the psoas muscle were drained and SAMS was again isolated in the fluid culture. The control echocardiogram showed slight pericardial effusion with no signs of haemodynamic compromise or constrictive physiology. Slow evolution of the patient, with progressive disappearance of the different infectious foci and clinical improvement without new episodes of fever. Periodic blood cultures were negative. Finally, after 8 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, she was discharged for outpatient follow-up. Treatment at discharge was omeprazole 20 mg every 24 hours, dexketoprofen 25 mg every 12 hours, colchicine 0.5 mg every 24 hours, paracetamol 1 g every 8 hours and bemiparin 7,500 IU every 24 hours.  DIAGNOSIS Persistent SAMS bacteraemia with multiple foci (purulent pericarditis, multiple psoas abscesses, spondylodiscitis, cellulitis, bilateral septic shoulder arthritis). Effusive-constrictive pericarditis resolved with medical treatment. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Personal history We present the case of a 56-year-old Caucasian woman, administrative profession. She had no known cardiovascular risk factors, except obesity. Her cardiological history included an admission one year earlier for an episode of unstable angina with cardiac catheterisation that revealed a critical lesion of the ostial left main coronary artery (LMCA), on which a drug-eluting stent was implanted, with no significant lesions in the rest of the coronary arteries. The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed during this admission showed a left ventricle of normal size and thickness, with normal global systolic function and segmental contractility and no significant valvulopathies. His medical history included a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis since 1998, for which he was receiving chronic treatment with immunosuppressants (azathioprine) in addition to bisoprolol 2.5mg/24 hours, lansoprazole, acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel and atorvastatin 20 mg.  Current illness and physical examination In the last few months, the patient reported symptoms of asthenia and dyspnoea, without chest pain, with progressive worsening of the functional grade up to NYHA functional grade III/IV, for which reason a stress test had been requested. The exercise test was stopped early due to hypertensive crisis with dyspnoea and electrical positivity. That same day, hours after the exercise stress test, he attended the Emergency Department of our hospital due to a sudden episode of dyspnoea and acute pulmonary oedema. On arrival at the ED he had a BP in MSI of 95/60 and in MSD of 146/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 85 bpm, a baseline saturation of 92% and was afebrile. On cardiac auscultation he had rhythmic heart sounds, with aortic diastolic murmur III/IV and mitral systolic murmur III/VI. He had bilateral crackles up to the upper fields with no oedema in the lower limbs. In the upper limbs, there was a decrease in radial and brachial pulses in the left upper limb (MSI) compared to the right upper limb (MSD).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Blood count: Hb 12.9g/dl, leukocytes 10,5000 (57% N), platelets 480,000. Coagulation: PT 98%, FD 700. Urgent blood biochemistry: Glc 158 mg/dl, U 39 mg/dl, Cr 0.98 mg/dl, Na 139 mmol/l, K 4 mmol/l, CK 172 U/l, TnT (ultrasensitive, upper limit 35 ng/l): 27 ng/l. Complete biochemistry: Glc 89 mg/dl, U 46 mg/dl, Cr 0.83 mg/dl, eGFR >60ml/min/1.7, urate 7 mg/dl, Na 141 mmol/l, K 4 mmol/l, Ca 2.36 mmol/l, phosphate 1.51 mmol/l, CK 65 U/l, LDH 178 U/l, FA 57 U/l, ALT 11U/L, BrT <1 mg/dl, total protein 66 g/l, creatinine 133 mg/dl, CRP 2.2 mg/dl. Immunological study: positive ANAs autoantibodies at 1/320 titre, with nucleolar pattern. The rest was normal.  Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm, left anterior hemiblock and subepicardial ischaemia in the anterolateral region. Chest X-ray: compatible with acute pulmonary oedema. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram: left ventricle slightly dilated and hypertrophic, with moderately depressed systolic function (LVEF estimated by Simpson at 42%) at the expense of a global hypokinesia, more marked in anterior and lateral regions. The aortic valve was trivalve, with no evidence of vegetation or prolapse and presented severe aortic insufficiency with a central regurgitant jet originating at the level of the entire commissure between the non-coronary and left coronary leaflets with coaptation defect of the leaflets, suggesting leaflet retraction at this level as the underlying mechanism. The aortic root was of normal size. At mitral valve level a mitral insufficiency (MI) grade 2 was detected and at tricuspid level a severe tricuspid insufficiency (TI) which estimated a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of approximately 80 mmHg. Cardiac catheterisation: occlusion of the right coronary artery at the ostial level which was filled by collateral circulation. The patency of the stent previously implanted at the level of the left main coronary artery persisted. Angio-CT of the thoracic aorta: thickening of the arterial wall of the common carotid arteries and of the left subclavian artery, which is occluded with filiform tracts affecting the occlusion at the origin of the left vertebral artery, and of the superior mesenteric artery, which is also occluded with hypertrophy of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade. There is no calcium deposit in any of the lesions, ulcerations, dissection or aneurysm. Infectious serology: HBsAg, anti-HCV, HIV Ag+Ac and Syphilis G+M negative. Biopsy (aortic valve): the sample submitted as aortic valve with presence of myxoid degenerative changes and chronic lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate.  EVOLUTION We present the case of a 56-year-old woman with a cardiac history of ostial LMCA disease revascularised percutaneously with a drug-eluting stent one year earlier, who was admitted with acute pulmonary oedema. Physical examination of the patient revealed the presence of murmurs in aortic and mitral foci, suggestive of valve disease at these levels, which were not present in the echocardiogram of a year earlier, as well as a clear decrease in pulses in MSI together with a significant discordance between systolic blood pressure between both upper limbs (BP in MSI of 95/60 and in MSD of 146/70 mmHg). In addition to a more marked global hypokinesia in the anterior and lateral regions, the presence of severe aortic insufficiency (AIo), the mechanism of which appeared to be a coaptation defect of the non-coronary and left coronary leaflets due to their retraction, with a normal-sized aortic root. Given the ischaemic alterations in the ECG on admission and the segmental alterations in contractility in the echocardiogram, coronary angiography was performed in the following 24 hours, which showed the previous stent in the IVC to be permeable and without restenosis, and occlusion of the ostial right coronary artery, which at that time was pending a decision on revascularisation strategy. Given the findings consisting of asymmetry in pulses and blood pressure in both upper limbs, ostial coronary lesions and severe aortic insufficiency of subacute onset, together with a history of autoimmune involvement and in a patient without CVRF, an aortic CT angiography was requested with suspicion of aortitis, in addition to complete immunological studies, acute phase reactants (APR) and serology. Angio-CT showed thickening of the arterial wall of both common carotid arteries and left subclavian, left vertebral and superior mesenteric arteries. A diagnosis of aortitis in the context of large vessel vasculitis was established. Treatment was started with glucocorticoids at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg with a subsequent tapering regimen, and the dose of azathioprine that the patient was taking was doubled. After presenting her case at a medical-surgical session (Heart Team), surgical treatment was decided once the patient was stabilised, with resolution of the acute pulmonary oedema. After 10 days of treatment with oral glucocorticoids, the aortic valve was replaced with a metallic prosthesis no. 21 and coronary revascularisation by means of aorto-coronary bypass from the saphenous vein to the middle anterior descending artery and proximal right coronary artery. During surgery, the aorta was also affected, with marked thickening of both the aortic wall and the wall of the coronary arteries, as well as friability of these tissues and the aortic annulus. After the procedure, she presented haemodynamic instability, requiring high-dose amines and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. 24 hours later the patient was in cardiogenic shock related to perioperative infarction. She presented a slow evolution in the following days with poor tolerance to amine weaning and removal of the balloon with severe haemodynamic instability and progression to multi-organ failure, and finally exitus.  DIAGNOSIS Vasculitis of large vessels of the Takayasu arteritis type. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Two children, one 15 years old pending analysis and one 13 years old with LDL 215 mg/dl on treatment by her paediatrician with rosuvastatin 20 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg and pending genetic study of HFHe).  Current illness She came to the emergency department for clinical symptoms that began 3 weeks earlier, consisting of progressive dyspnoea until minimal effort, increased oedema in the lower limbs, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea crisis, palpitations with a sensation of irradiation to the neck, multiple ecchymosis in the upper and lower limbs and hypoaesthesia in the left lower limb. He denies orthopnoea or diuresis curtailment. She has not presented chest pain. No arthralgias or arthritis, nor oral aphthous ulcers. No fever at home.  Physical examination Blood pressure 129/84 mmHg, heart rate 85 bpm, respiratory rate 18 rpm, temperature 37.6 oC. Acceptable general condition, conscious, oriented and cooperative. Well hydrated and perfused, normal colour. Slight tachypnoea at rest, with slurred speech although maintaining baseline oxygen saturation 97%, mild dysphonia. Glasgow 15/15. Cardiac auscultation showed rhythmic tones at a good frequency without murmurs, without pericardial friction. Respiratory auscultation showed minimal bibasal crackles and some isolated wheezing. The abdomen is unremarkable. The neurological examination showed isochoric pupils that were normoreactive to light, preserved cranial nerves, diminished gross tactile sensitivity in the left lower limb, more marked in the anterior thigh region. Gait was not examined. The lower limbs showed oedema with fovea up to mid-leg, with signs of chronic venous insufficiency, without signs of deep vein thrombosis, with peripheral pulses present and symmetrical. There were multiple small ecchymoses on the upper and lower limbs.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS On arrival at the ED: Analysis: high sensitivity troponin I 855.40 ng/l (normal 2-15.6) and C-reactive protein 32.7 mg/l (normal < 5). Haemoglobin 14.2 g/dl, leucocytes 10.08 x10^3/μl, with eosinophils 1.68 x10^3/μl (normal 0.02-0.55) and platelets 79 x10^3/μl. Coagulation was normal except for D-dimer 1,785 ng/ml (normal < 500). Electrocardiogram on arrival: sinus rhythm at 93 bpm, PR 0.14 s constant, QRS 0.10 s, electrical axis over +90o, ST depression of 1 mm in II, III, aVF, V3-V6, flattened T waves in inferior leads and negative in V3-V6. Chest X-ray showed no cardiomegaly or parenchymal condensation. Prominent hilarity was present. No pleural effusion or costophrenic sinus impingement was observed. Given the findings, myocardial damage marker serology was requested, as well as a chest CT angiography for suspected pulmonary thromboembolism. Chest CT angiography: no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism were observed, the pulmonary parenchyma showed no alterations, subcentimetric adenopathies of probably reactive appearance were observed at the para-aortic, right paratracheal, hilar and subcarinal levels of 1.5 cm. Control laboratory tests at 4 hours: troponin I increased to 1,770.3 ng/l, with normal CK. During his stay in the intensive care unit and on the internal medicine hospital ward: given the clinical suspicion, an autoimmune panel was urgently requested, in which positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were found with positive anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies (IgG) (19.1 IU/ml [0-6]), the rest negative. Serialisation of myocardial damage markers was continued, with a peak value of troponin I of 5,065 ng/l. The peak value of brain pro-brain natriuretic peptide was 6,819.8 pg/ml (high probability of heart failure in patients under 55 years of age if > 450 pg/ml). In the routine analysis, extracted 72 hours after admission, glucose 157 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 261 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 59 mg/dl, triglycerides 155 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 449 U/l (125-220), complement C3 61 mg/dl (90-180) with normal C4, thyrotropin 0.34 μUI/ml (0.35-4.94), free thyroxine 0.85 ng/dl (0.7-1.48), free triiodothyronine 1.62 pg/ml (1.71-3.71). HIV screening and other infectious immunodiagnostic tests were negative. The bedside echocardiogram performed in intensive care on admission showed a non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with preserved systolic function, even hypercontractile with concentric hypertrophy with an interventricular septum of 14 mm and a posterior wall of 13 mm. Aortic root not dilated. Dilated right ventricle (RV) with a basal diameter of 39 mm, 10 mm lateral wall with hyperechoic image adjacent to the lateral wall. Triscuspid insufficiency with estimated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP) of 100 mmHg. Dilated right atrium (RA) with an area of 22 cm2. Normal mitral flow pattern. Mild pericardial effusion adjacent to LV. Echocardiogram performed by cardiology 72 hours after admission showed (body surface area 1.9 m2). Non-dilated LV (DTD 47 mm, 51 ml/m2), without hypertrophy at baseline (IVS 9, PP 9 mm), although progressive thickening from mid segments and especially apex (15 mm), with preserved global systolic function (EF 71% 4C), without evident alterations of segmental contractility. Restrictive mitral filling pattern, with E/A 2.2, e' 6 cm/s, E/e' 14. Dilated right chambers (RV 42 mm basal, RA 18 cm2). RV normocontractile (TAPSE 19 mm, s-wave 12 cm/s). Dilated left atrium (LA) (38 ml/m2). Without good visualisation of the aortic root, apparently not dilated. Dilated inferior vena cava (IVC) (27 mm), with little inspiratory collapse. Dilatation of suprahepatic veins. Slight inferior pericardial effusion (2 mm), with no signs of haemodynamic compromise. No apparent intracavitary thrombus. Trivalve aortic valve with preserved mobility. Normal aortic flow. Normal mitral valve morphology. Mild central mitral insufficiency. Mild tricuspid and pulmonary insufficiency, estimating PSAP of 49 mmHg (V max 2.9 m/s) and PMAP of 30 mmHg (V max 1.9 m/s). Pulmonary TA 105 ms. In short, he presented a pattern of myocardial restriction, non-dilated LV with preserved EF, apical hypertrophy, severe diastolic dysfunction, slightly dilated RV with preserved EF, high probability of pulmonary hypertension, biauricular dilatation, mild mitral and tricuspid insufficiency, mild pericardial effusion. Given the clinical history, compatible with Löffler's endocarditis. After a week of admission, left and right cardiac catheterisation was performed. After obtaining 6F radial access, a good calibre LMCA with no angiographic lesions, a good calibre anterior descending artery (ADA) with no angiographic lesions and good distal flow, a good calibre circumflex artery (Cx) with no angiographic lesions and good distal flow, and a dominant right coronary artery (RCA) with good calibre, no angiographic lesions and good distal flow were visualised. The left ventriculography showed a non-dilated left ventricle with severe apical hypertrophy, preserved systolic function with LVEF 64.5%, mild mitral insufficiency, LV end-diastolic pressure of 29 mmHg. Regarding right catheterisation, AD pressure = 25 mmHg, RV systolic pressure = 43 mmHg, RV diastolic pressure = 11 mmHg, mean RV pressure = 15 mmHg, pulmonary systolic pressure = 45 mmHg, pulmonary diastolic pressure = 28 mmHg, mean pulmonary pressure = 33 mmHg, diastolic transpulmonary gradient = PAMP - PCP = 4 mmHg, concluding in isolated postcapillary pulmonary hypertension. Right ventriculography showed significant apical hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction (RVEF 52%), mild tricuspid insufficiency and mild pulmonary insufficiency. An endomyocardial biopsy was performed with 3 samples taken (right ventricle). The septal biopsy showed a fibrous cap of normal thickness overlying myocardium, free of inflammatory infiltration, with no histological criteria for endocarditis. The apex biopsy is a minimal fragment of lax fibrous tissue without inflammatory changes and haematic material, unsatisfactory for diagnosis. The basal biopsy is a small fragment of endocardium, without myocardium, with discrete endothelial hyperplasia, suggestive of reactive and slight haematic infiltrate secondary to biopsy, without inflammatory infiltration. Cardiac MRI performed prior to the start of cyclophosphamide showed non-dilated ventricles with preserved systolic function, findings compatible with biventricular endomyocardial fibrosis, with organised left ventricular apical thrombus, secondary to granulomatosis with polyangiitis (late-stage endomyocardial fibrosis), tethering of the inferior papillary muscle and slight hypokinesis of apical segments and apex of the left ventricle, as well as of the apical segment of the right ventricular free wall, biauricular enlargement, tricuspid insufficiency of doubtful significance, pericarditis with signs of active inflammation and slight pericardial effusion. Myocardial septal thickness 10 mm; anterior 11 mm; lateral 10 mm; inferior 11 mm. End-diastolic diameter 49 mm; end-systolic diameter 35 mm. Relative wall thickness 0.24. Indexed mass: 39 g/m2. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 4 months (video 2) showed a significant decrease in the thickness of the distal segments with respect to the previous study, no tethering of the inferior papillary muscle, ventricles with slightly reduced volumes and normal systolic function and slight pericardial effusion. In short, compared to the previous study, there was a great improvement in ventricular thicknesses and apical thrombus, which has disappeared. Measurements: left ventricle: septum 5 mm, posterior wall 5 mm, DTD 48 mm, VTD 119 cc, VTS 53 cc, Systolic volume 67 cc, iVTD 66 cc/m2, iVTS 29 cc/m2, LVEF 56%. Left ventricle: septum 5 mm, posterior wall 5 mm, DTD 48 mm, VTD 119 cc, VTS 53 cc, Systolic volume 67 cc, iVTD 66 cc/m2, iVTS 29 cc/m2, LVEF 56%. Right ventricle: RVT 143 cc, STV 60 cc, Systolic volume 83 cc, iVTD 79 cc/m2, iVTS 33 cc/m2, LVEF 58%. Left atrium: area in 4 chambers 16 cm2. Right atrium: area in 4 chambers 19 cm2. Sinus aorta (diameter in sinuses of Valsalva): 28 mm. Ascending aorta: 25 mm. Descending aorta: 19 mm.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION After first-level complementary tests were performed in the emergency department with the findings described, pulmonary thromboembolism was suspected, which was ruled out by angio-CT. Given the clinical picture and the analytical data, it was decided to admit the patient to intensive care. This unit consulted with internal medicine for assessment. Due to his history (sinusitis, hypereosinophilia), clinical manifestations (dyspnoea, oedema in the lower limbs, etc.), analyses (elevated cardiac enzymes, thrombopenia, eosinophilia, etc.) and echocardiographic data of myocardial infiltration compatible with Löffler's endocarditis, it was suspected that it could be APEEG, and an urgent ANCA ELISA study was requested, which was positive (myeloperoxidase). Steroid treatment was started immediately with boluses of 1 g of 6-methylprednisolone for 3 consecutive days, with significant clinical improvement reflected in the analytical parameters (thrombopenia, eosinophilia and troponin), to be continued with 60 mg of prednisone daily. After 7 days of hospitalisation, cyclophosphamide was administered in boluses of 500 mg (fixed dose) every 15 days, which were programmed to complete 6 boluses. Right and left cardiac catheterisation was performed with biopsy, which did not clarify the diagnosis. Clinically and haemodynamically stable, she was discharged from hospital after 2 weeks of admission, under treatment with prednisone 60 mg at breakfast (which was progressively reduced to 15 mg), calcium 600 mg/cholecalciferol 1.000 IU (1 tablet daily), ibandronic acid (1 tablet monthly at fasting), torasemide 5 mg (1 tablet at breakfast), acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg (1 tablet at lunch), omeprazole (1 capsule at breakfast) and atorvastatin 80 mg (1 tablet at dinner).  Outpatient follow-up showed total cholesterol 413 mg/dl, non-HDL cholesterol 326 mg/dl and triglycerides 308 mg/dl, and treatment was started with anti-PCSK9 (evolocumab 140 mg subcutaneous every 2 weeks) and omega-3 acid ethyl esters (two capsules every 12 hours). The response was spectacular, with LDL cholesterol reduced to 62 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 66 mg/dl and triglycerides 125 mg/dl. Dyspnoea did not return and acute phase reactants remained normal, with no eosinophilia.  DIAGNOSIS Congestive heart failure and isolated postcapillary pulmonary hypertension related to acute myocarditis (Loeffler's endocarditis) with myocardial restriction pattern and severe diastolic dysfunction in the context of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Apical thrombus in the left ventricle resolved. Moderate thrombopenia of autoimmune origin resolved. Euthyroid patient syndrome. Primary familial hypercholesterolemia (very probable HFHe). Secondary hypertriglyceridaemia. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O

No other medical or surgical history of interest. Home treatment: bisoprolol 5 mg (two tablets every 24 h); ramipril 5 mg (1-0-0).  Present illness He presented to his health centre with nausea and general malaise of two hours' duration. No palpitations or chest pain. No syncope. No evidence of heart failure. During his stay at the health centre, frequent episodes of incessant wide QRS tachycardia with rapid rates (200 bpm) were recorded on the monitor and he was transferred to hospital.  Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 120/70 mmHG, heart rate (HR) 80 bpm, oxygen saturation 100%. Good general condition. Normal skin and mucous membrane colouring. No jugular plethora. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart tones, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur.  Abdominal examination: soft, depressible, no megaliths, no pain, preserved peristaltic sounds. Extremities: no oedema, with preserved peripheral pulses.   COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG): atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response. QRS of 120 ms, intraventricular conduction disorders. No signs of acute ischaemia. Presence of frequent ventricular extrasystoles (VE) with right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) morphology. Electrocardiogram during tachycardia: wide QRS tachycardia, with morphology of complete left bundle branch block, left inferior axis, cycle 260 ms. Regular R-R. Prior to the onset of tachycardia we observed frequent right ventricular outflow tract extrasystoles with a different morphology to that of the tachycardia (R more prominent and positive in III). Laboratory tests on admission: haemoglobin 15.9 g/dl, leucocytes 5.20 10^3/μl, platelets 113.0 10^3/μl. Prothrombin time (PT) s 14.4. Quick's index 65%. INR 1.33. APTT (T. cephalin) s 47.1. Glucose 93 mg/dl, urea 22.0 mg/dl, creatinine 0.95 mg/dl, uric acid 5.1 mg/dl, albumin 4.3 g/dl, total protein 7.0 g/dl. Total cholesterol 148 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 34.5 mg/dl, non-HDL cholesterol 113.5 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 102.9 mg/dl, VLDL cholesterol 10.6 mg/dl, triglycerides 53.0 mg/dl, sodium 136 mm/l, potassium 4.0 mm/l, phosphorus 2.7 mg/dl, total bilirubin 0.98 mg/dl. GPT (ALT) 28.4 U/l, GOT (AST) 35.7 U/l, gamma GT 34.5 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 53.0 U/l, LDH 221.5 U/l, creatine kinase 288 U/l, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (DCCT) 6.0%. Thyroid stimulating hormone 0.310 mIU/l, free T3 - free triiodothyronine 2.54 pg/ml, free T4 - free thyroxine 0.84 ng/dl. Myocardial damage markers (troponin I and CK-MB) were normal serially x 3. Chest X-ray: normal. Cardiothoracic index (CTI) within normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on admission: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with moderate concentric hypertrophy. Moderate-severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 35% by Simpson biplane), global hypokinesia with worse anterior contractility. Slightly dilated left atrium. Structurally normal mitral valve with mild insufficiency. Aortic valve trivalve, sclerotic, normofunctioning. Normal tricuspid valve. Non-dilated right ventricle (RV) with good systolic function. No pericardial effusion. Transthoracic echocardiogram at one week: non-dilated LV with moderate concentric hypertrophy. Global systolic function preserved without contractility alterations. LVEF by Simpson BP 55%. Rest unchanged with respect to previous study. Coronary angiography: left vascular tree without lesions. Dominant right coronary artery (RCA), with lesion of doubtful significance in the middle third. After intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), 70% stenosis was found. Revascularisation: right coronary: direct drug-eluting stent implantation (Resolute Onix 4 x 12 mm) in the middle third. Good final angiographic result. Electrophysiological study (EEF): with right femoral venous access. There is evidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) with EV with left bundle branch block morphology (LBBB) ID axis with other advanced complexes and wide QRS presenting LBBB with axis II. A pathological HV of 80 msg is evident, which is difficult to maintain stable. High-dose aleudrine increased atrioventricular (AV) conduction to a HR of 120-130 without aberrant conduction. After TEE ruled out thrombi in the left atrium (LA), electrical cardioversion (ECV) was performed with a switch to SR with 200 J in biphasic mode. Aleudrine induced ventricular tachycardia in a fairly reproducible manner (periods without AV ratio 1x1, with AV dissociation with morphology equal to the clinical one [LBBB and with transition in V4-V5]), well tolerated and with a cycle of 260 msg. In the case of suspected branch-branch ventricular tachycardia (BRVT), attempts are made to obtain stable His, which is impossible using Josephson tetra, His tetra and deflectable decapolar. Neither is it possible to analyse pacing from the RA because of the large pacing artefact that prevents verification of the QRS morphology. However, we concluded that it was RRVT with other criteria: return cycle from RV apex of 0 and electrogram of right ventricular apex early on the onset of the QRS. Right bundle branch ablation was performed using a conventional 4 mm FJ catheter, which was achieved after three applications. The right bundle branch was found not to lead for 30 minutes. Subsequently, a DDDR Boston bicameral pacemaker was implanted.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION With the diagnosis of probable ventricular tachycardia, treatment was started with beta-blockers and amiodarone, and he was admitted to the cardiology ward with telemetry. Forty-eight hours after admission, during his stay on the ward, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing the presence of severe global LV dysfunction, with worse contractility in the anterior territory, which recovered completely one week after admission. Coronary angiography was performed, which revealed an intermediate lesion in the mid-right coronary artery. Revascularisation with a drug-eluting stent was considered. Given the clinical presentation (no chest pain, no signs of acute ischaemia in the electrocardiogram and no elevation of myocardial damage markers), the presence of severe global ventricular dysfunction that recovered early after control of the arrhythmia was considered as dysfunction secondary to tachycardiomyopathy. Finally, an electrophysiological study was performed which documented, firstly, that it was a ventricular tachycardia (existence of VA dissociation) and subsequently, by means of manoeuvres, that it was a branch-branch ventricular tachycardia (electrogram of the right ventricular apex early on the start of the QRS) and, another fundamental fact, the return cycle was very short (10 ms) after the tachycardia was triggered from the RV apex. Right bundle branch ablation and DDD pacemaker implantation was performed (due to HV lengthening up to 100 ms). Once discharged, the patient's evolution has been excellent. No arrhythmic recurrences. Ejection fraction remained preserved. In addition, he was referred to neurology consultations to rule out the possibility of neuromuscular disease (due to its association with this type of tachycardia in patients without heart disease), and an electromyogram and genetic study were performed, which ruled out this possibility.  DIAGNOSIS Branch-branch ventricular tachycardia (BRVT). Tachycardiomyopathy. Preserved left ventricular function at discharge. Intermediate lesion in the middle DC. Revascularisation by drug-eluting stent implantation. Right bundle branch ablation. Implantation of DDDR Boston pacemaker. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION During the percutaneous intervention in the haemodynamics room, our patient presented a progressive clinical worsening. Tendency to arterial hypotension with poor peripheral perfusion, requiring the initiation of vasoactive drugs (dobutamine and noradrenaline) at medium doses, as well as respiratory failure requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Prior to leaving the haemodynamic ward, a balloon counterpulsation device (IABP) was implanted. During his stay in the intensive care unit he evolved favourably, allowing the weaning of vasoactive drugs and the removal of the IABP on the fourth day. During admission to the hospital ward (18 days of hospitalisation), congestive data persisted with very slow resolution despite forcing a negative water balance with intravenous diuretic, as well as borderline blood pressure and transient worsening of renal function that made it difficult to initiate neurohormonal treatment, and he was discharged in NYHA functional class (FC) II. The echocardiogram performed showed severely depressed ventricular function. Regarding treatment at discharge, priority was given to oral diuretic treatment with furosemide and eplerenone, together with low doses of beta-blockers, given the circumstances described above. After hospital discharge, our patient was referred to the cardiac rehabilitation unit (CRP) and, in parallel, began follow-up in the advanced heart failure unit. During phase II of the CRP, our patient underwent the educational programme, dietary recommendations, review of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and home medical treatment. Subsequently, he successfully completed 8 weeks of face-to-face training guided by ergospirometry, supervised by the cardiologist and rehabilitation physician. Regarding treatment, drugs with prognostic benefit were prioritised (quadruple therapy), suspending furosemide treatment and reducing the dose of eplerenone, which allowed the progressive initiation, with close monitoring of renal function, of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor (iSGLT2) and angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) at low doses. Finally, intravenous ferric carboxymaltose was administered on an outpatient basis in day hospital (iron profile: iron 50 μg/dl, ferritin 150 ng/dl, haemoglobin 13.3 g/dl, haematocrit 44%). After close comprehensive management, our patient showed a clear improvement 4 months after the event, improving both in functional class (stable CF I) and in analytical data (final NTproBNP 2178 pg/ml; initial 8682 pg/ml) and echocardiographic data, with an estimated ventricular function of 46%.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  History Male, 61 years old. No known allergic reactions to medication. Cardiovascular risk factors: arterial hypertension. Obesity grade 2 (body mass index 37.86 kg/m2). No diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia. No toxic habits. Surgical history: operated for left trimalleolar fracture with osteosynthesis of peroneal malleolus with 6-hole tube third plate and osteosynthesis of tibial malleolus with a screw in 2009. Non-cardiological medical history: Moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), under follow-up by the outpatient pulmonology department of his referral hospital. Sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS) being treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and home oxygen. Prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed in 2016, treated with radiotherapy and hormone blockade. Unfiliated renal tumour, first detected in 2017. Not operated on at his referral hospital due to high surgical risk. Abdomino-pelvic CT scan performed at his reference hospital in 2020: mixed nodule measuring 20 x 18 mm in the right kidney, close to the lower pole, eccentric, without clear perirenal fatty infiltration. Stability in radiological follow-up, so it has been considered non-malignant. Cardiological history: non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 2003, with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Loss of follow-up until 2012. In 2012 the patient returned to the cardiology outpatient clinic at his referral hospital. Echocardiogram at that time showed a severely dilated left ventricle (LV), with biplane EF 29%, with diffuse global hypokinesia. Coronary angiography showed irregularities in the right coronary artery, the rest of the coronary tree showed no alterations. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation with cardiac resynchronisation therapy (ICD-CRT) was decided in March 2012 for primary prevention of sudden death.  An appropriate shock due to non-sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (NSMVT) occurred in December 2012. In reviews of the ICD, multiple episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) treated with overstimulation were detected, so amiodarone was started. In February 2020, a new ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred with appropriate ICD discharge, and the patient was admitted to his referral hospital. The last transthoracic echocardiogram, performed during this admission, showed a severely dilated left ventricle (DTD 104 mm, VTDi 207 ml/m2, VTSi 157 ml/m2), with severe depression of function (LVEF 23% biplane), with severe global hypokinesia. Dilated left atrium (34 cm2). Diastolic dysfunction grade I with signs of increased filling pressures (E/e" 20). Mitral valve with mild regurgitation due to dilatation of the annulus. Aortic flow with slightly increased gradients (11/5 mmHg), without aortic insufficiency. Mild tricuspid insufficiency (LAD electrode) that does not allow adequate estimation of systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery. Dilated right ventricle (44 mm baseline), with RVEF at the lower limit (TAPSE 18 mm). No pericardial effusion. Usual treatment: atorvastatin 80 mg (1 tablet daily), amiodarone 200 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), furosemide 40 mg (2 tablets daily), carvedilol 12.5 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), esomeprazole 20 mg (1 tablet every 24 hours), indacaterol/glycopyrronium bromide 85/43 mcg (1 inhalation every 24 hours), tamsulosin 0.4 mg (1 tablet per day). Present illness A 61-year-old male who, referred from his referral centre, was admitted in May 2020 to the cardiology inpatient ward of the advanced heart failure and heart transplant unit to assess treatment options. The patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction in 2003 and had stopped attending check-ups until 2012. At present, the patient reports NYHA functional class III/IV, with sustained symptoms for the last few months. He has orthopnoea. He can walk only 50 metres without having to stop, with difficulty climbing a floor. No episodes of palpitations, syncope or presyncope, nor new ICD discharges. No other associated symptoms. Physical examination Conscious and oriented, eupneic at rest. Blood pressure 118/71 mmHg, heart rate 53 bpm, peripheral oxygen saturation 98% (FiO2 21%). Weight 112 kg, height 172 cm, body mass index (BMI) 37.86 kg/m2 (obesity grade 2) Cardiac auscultation: regular heart tones, no murmurs or audible friction rubs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur with no added sounds, although some generalised hypoventilation was observed. Extremities: slight tibiomalleolar oedema with fovea, with no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS 12-lead electrocardiogram on admission: sinus bradycardia at 50 beats per minute, with ventricular rhythm due to pacemaker in VAT. Chest X-ray on admission PA: no infiltrates or masses were identified. No costophrenic sinus impingement. ICD-CRT correctly positioned. SARS-CoV2 CRP: not detected. Transthoracic echocardiogram at bedside: poor acoustic access due to obesity. The left ventricle is severely dilated (DVItd 9.7 cm, DVIts 9.1 cm, indexed DVItd (cm/m2) 4.4 cm/m2, indexed DVIts (cm/m2) 4.1 cm/m2). Left ventricular systolic function is severely reduced (EF [Teich] 13.8%). Estimation of EF by Simpson's method is poorly assessable due to poor acoustic access. Right ventricle of normal dimensions (baseline RV dimensions 3.8 cm, indexed baseline RV dimensions (cm/m2) 1.72 cm/m2, RV diastolic area 19.6 cm2, RV end-systolic area 15.4 cm2). Right ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately reduced (TAPSE 3.6 cm, RV FAC 21.7%). Difficult to assess correctly due to poor acoustic access. Mild left atrial dilatation (LA diameter 4.3 cm). Right atrial size is normal. Mitral valve with degenerative changes. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation detected. Difficult to quantify. Holosystolic flow but low density (Vmax E MV 75.0 cm/s, Vmax A V: 88.4 cm/s, E/A MV 0.85, mitral E/e' (medial) 15.7 {ratio}, E' peak velocity lat. 3.5 cm/s, E' peak velocity med. 4.8 cm/s, mitral E/e' (lateral) 21.4 {ratio}). Tricuspid valve normal in structure and function. No tricuspid insufficiency. No indirect signs of significant pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Trivalve aortic valve normal in appearance. The pulmonary valve is not well visualised. The aortic root is of normal size. No signs of increased central venous pressure (CVID 1.84 cm, CVID inspiration 0.58 cm). There is no pericardial effusion. Blood tests: Biochemistry: glucose 108 mg/dl, creatinine 1.05 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) 76 ml/min, sodium 142 mEq/l, potassium 4.1 mEq/l, chlorine 103 mEq/l, uric acid 5,9 mg/dl, total bilirubin 0.86 mg/dl, AST/GOT 19 U/l, ALT/GPT 13 U/l, GGT 37 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 69 U/l, NT-proBNP 497 pg/ml, total protein 6.0 g/dl. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 162 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol (direct) 51 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol (calculated) 91 mg/dl, triglycerides 99 mg/dl. Iron profile: iron 89 μg/dl, total Fe binding capacity 291 μg/dl, transferrin desaturation index 31%, ferritin 186 ng/ml, transferrin 225 mg/dl. Haemogram: red cells 4.07 x 10^6/μl, haemoglobin 12.2 g/dl, haematocrit 38.0%, MCV 93 fl, MCH 30.0 pg, leucocytes 6.66 x 10^3/μl, neutrophils 3.53 x 10^3/μl, lymphocytes 2.00 x 10^3/μl, monocytes 0.84 x 10^3/μl, eosinophils 0.25 x 10^3/μL, basophils 0.04 x 10^3/μl, platelets 228 x 10^3/μl. Thyroid hormones: TSH 0.53 mU/l, free T4 1.70 ng/dl. Glycosylated haemoglobin A1c 6.4%, mean estimated glucose 137 mg/dl.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient remained stable throughout admission. The case was referred to the endocrinometabolic surgery unit, which decided that the patient was not a candidate for bariatric surgery due to a history of prostatic neoplasia under active treatment (less than 5 years). On discharge, his usual treatment was maintained. However, given that during admission he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 6.4%), it was decided to start treatment with semaglutide 0.5 mg, one injection per week for 4 weeks, subsequently increasing to 1 mg per week indefinitely, with good tolerance.  Treatment was also started with dapagliflozin 10 mg 1 tablet per day and eplerenone 25 mg 1 tablet per day. Education in heart failure is started. Periodic scheduled admissions were decided (the patient lives far from our hospital) for treatment with levosimendan under monitoring. During successive admissions, all of which were uneventful, a gradual weight loss was observed as follows: in June 2020, the patient weighed 107 kg, in July 2020 he weighed 100 kg, and in August 2020 he weighed 94 kg. The patient reports a marked improvement of his functional class, almost NYHA class I. Laboratory tests show a reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from 6.4% in May to 5.7% at 3 months. On admission in September 2020, the patient weighs 89 kg and in October 2020, the weight is maintained at 89 kg. Subsequent outpatient follow-up is carried out at our hospital. The patient indicates that he has reduced his weight to 84 kg (BMI 28.39 kg/m2, overweight grade 2). He reports some fatigue on exertion, but denies dyspnoea. He is able to climb several floors without stopping. He has stopped taking furosemide tablets. Therefore, and as a summary, since the introduction of antidiabetic treatment (semaglutide 1 mg weekly and dapagliflozin 10 mg daily), the patient has started a progressive and constant weight reduction until reaching a weight of 84 kg, managing to maintain the loss over time. From an initial weight of 112 kg and a BMI of 37.86 kg/m2 (grade 2 obesity), the patient reduced his weight by a total of 28 kg in approximately 6 months, reaching a BMI of 28.39 kg/m2 (grade 2 overweight). At the same time, the patient reports progressive improvement in symptoms and functional class. Initially, in our first assessment, he was considerably limited by his heart disease, with NYHA functional class III, and was practically asymptomatic on discharge from our centre (NYHA class I). As a result, the patient was no longer indicated for intervention by the advanced heart failure and heart transplant unit, and was therefore followed up by the cardiology department of his referral hospital.  DIAGNOSIS Heart failure with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.  Other diagnoses: Obesity grade 2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Once close to euvolemia, prognostically beneficial treatment was started with beta-blockers, ARNI and antialdosteronics with adequate tolerance. The discharge medication included bisoprolol 5 mg/24h, sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg/12h, eplerenone 50 mg/24h. In addition, due to the presence of coronary atheromatosis, acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24 h and atorvastatin 40 mg/24 h were also started. During the analytical studies on admission, diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus were met (due to altered baseline glycaemia and elevated HbA1c levels), and so, upon debut with HbA1c > 10%, insulinisation was started together with oral antidiabetic drugs appropriate to the patient's clinical profile (established cardiovascular disease, obesity with BMI > 30 kg/m2). Thus, diabetes treatment at discharge consisted of insulin toujeo 24 IU/24 h, metformin/dapagliflozin 1000/5 mg (0.5 comp/12 h the first week and then 1 comp/24 h) and subcutaneous semaglutide (0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks and then 0.5 mg weekly). The patient is being followed up in heart failure and endocrinology consultations, with no new admissions for heart failure. Significant improvement in LVEF up to 35% and NT-proBNP levels (400-> 150 ng/l) was observed after 6 months of treatment, as well as a decrease in HbA1c levels (11.1 -> 8.5%) and weight during follow-up (currently 91 kg and BMI 29.7 kg/m2).  DIAGNOSIS First episode of decompensation of congestive heart failure. Dilated cardiomyopathy of non-ischaemic aetiology with severely depressed left ventricular systolic function. Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Obesity. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Echocardioscopy on arrival at the emergency department: non-dilated left ventricle with normal wall thickness, severe hypokinesia of the apical cap and hypokinesia of apical segments and middle segment of inferolateral, lateral and anterior faces, with hypercontractility of the remaining segments. Moderate-severe left ventricular dysfunction, estimated LVEF 30-35%. Right chambers of preserved size with preserved function. Non-dilated atria. Mild-moderate mitral insufficiency by colour Doppler. No pericardial effusion. Inferior vena cava 16 mm with adequate inspiratory collapse. Urgent diagnostic coronary angiography (video 1): significant stenosis of the left coronary trunk due to probable intramural haematoma causing extrinsic compression of the lumen, without significant angiographic lesions in the rest of the coronary tree. Urgent CT angiography: thoracoabdominal aorta of normal calibre, with no signs of acute pathology. No images compatible with acute aortic syndrome. Bilateral pulmonary alveolar lesions distributed throughout the upper lobes and apical segment of the lower lobes, suggesting an aspiration aetiology. Nutcracker's phenomenon with varicose dilatation of the left gonadal vein due to stenosis of the left renal vein in the aortomesenteric clamp. Bilateral adnexal cysts, functional type and free fluid in Douglas recess. No other findings of interest. Coronary revascularisation coronary angiography: the left coronary trunk was probed with an EBU 3.5 guide catheter, a guide was passed to the distal vessel of the anterior descending artery and contrast injection was performed, proving spiroid dissection of the left coronary trunk with preserved distal flow, Onyx Resolute 4 x 26 mm drug-eluting stent was implanted at 16 atm in the trunk towards the anterior descending artery with a good final angiographic result, without residual dissection. Post-catheterisation ECG: sinus tachycardia. Normal PR. Narrow QRS, axis at 30o with QS of V1-V3, QR in aVL.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION On arrival at the ED, the patient was hypotensive (blood pressure 95/50 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm), saturating at 97% with nasal spectacles at 2 litres/minute and with persistent chest pain. Urgent echocardiography showed moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and segmental alterations, and the patient was transferred to the haemodynamics department for urgent coronary angiography. The coronary angiography showed significant stenosis of the left main coronary artery due to a probable haematoma causing extrinsic compression, with no significant angiographic lesions in the rest of the coronary tree. Before proceeding to revascularisation, acute aortic syndrome was ruled out by urgent aortic CT angiography. After this, percutaneous revascularisation was chosen, so coronary angiography was repeated in the following hours and a stent was implanted in the left coronary artery towards the anterior descending coronary artery with good angiographic results. During the procedure, he presented hypotension and sinus tachycardia requiring continuous perfusion of noradrenaline (0.31 microg/kg/minute). She returned to the coronary unit asymptomatic, maintaining the noradrenaline perfusion which could be progressively withdrawn in the first 48 hours after revascularisation. After a favourable evolution, he was transferred to the hospital ward. Initially, double antiplatelet therapy was maintained with ASA 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg; however, given the high thrombotic risk due to stenting in the left coronary trunk, it was decided to switch to ticagrelor 48 hours after catheterisation. In the post-revascularisation echocardiographic control, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction persisted, so treatment for heart failure was started with good tolerance, presenting mild ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge. After hospital discharge, she was included in the cardiac rehabilitation programme, which she completed without incident. She is currently being monitored in cardiology consultations and has remained asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view. Follow-up echocardiography showed that left ventricular systolic function had recovered and was preserved one year after the event. Treatment at discharge: ASA 100 mg (every 24 hours), ticagrelor 90 mg (every 12 hours for one year), bisoprolol 1.25 mg (every 24 hours), ivabradine 5 mg (every 12 hours), ramipril 1.25 mg (every 24 hours), omeprazole 20 mg (every 24 hours).  DIAGNOSIS Anteroseptal ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEMI). Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the left main coronary artery treated with drug-eluting stent in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Acute septo-apical myocardial infarction. Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction in acute phase with subsequent recovery. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O B-FARMACO O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

CLINICAL EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to cardiology for decompensated heart failure. Intensive diuretic treatment was started with adequate depletion and the patient tolerated oral furosemide on discharge. An echocardiogram was performed on admission showing severe ventricular dysfunction (25%), with interventricular asynchrony and moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Given the indication for ICD-CRT, the case was discussed with the arrhythmia unit, and the device was implanted prior to discharge. In successive check-ups, the patient reported a marked improvement in functional class (currently in NYHA I), which remained stable.

HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  The patient was a 21-year-old male, with no known drug allergies. With regard to his toxic habits, he was a social drinker, non-smoker, denying the consumption of other toxic substances. He denied cardiovascular risk factors, cardiological history of interest and did not follow any outpatient treatment. He came to our emergency department with a fever of up to 39oC of three days' evolution. In the last 24 hours he began to experience abdominal pain in the mesogastrium, more accentuated in the right iliac fossa, which did not change with ingestion and was more accentuated when standing upright. There was no loss of appetite. He denied nausea or vomiting, alteration of transit, externalisation of bleeding or urinary symptoms. Blood pressure was 132/89 mmHg, oxygen saturation 100% baseline, temperature 36.4oC, acceptable general condition, conscious, oriented and cooperative, good hydration and perfusion, eupneic at rest and without neurological focality. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation showed no relevant findings. The abdomen was soft, depressible, with hydro-aerial sounds present, without palpable masses or megaliths, with intense pain on palpation of the right iliac fossa but without signs of peritoneal irritation. Given the suspicion of appendicitis, urgent analysis, abdominal CT scan and PCR for SARSCoV- 2 of the protocol prior to admission, initially in charge of the digestive system, were requested.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS With regard to the tests performed in the emergency department: In the urgent analysis, the biochemical analysis showed total bilirubin of 2.58 mg/dl (0.3-1.2) with direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dl (0-0.5) and C-reactive protein of 180 mg/l (0-5). The haemogram showed discrete leukocytosis of 11.69 x10^3/μl (4-11) with neutrophilia of 9.68 x10^3/μl. Coagulopathy was present, with prothrombin time of 51% (75-140) and calculated fibrinogen of 841 mg/dl, with normal activated partial thromboplastin time. Urinalysis showed urobilinogen 8 mg/dl and ketone bodies 60 mg/dl. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed and was positive, with gene amplification in late cycles, probably compatible with residual RNA. Abdominal CT scan without contrast showed normal liver and spleen, with no obvious focal lesions, normal-sized gallbladder, alliasic, with no signs of acute cholecystitis or bile duct dilatation. Pancreas without significant alterations. Normal sized kidneys with no evidence of lithiasis or hydronephrosis. Inflammatory changes were identified in the cecum, ileocecal valve and terminal ileum. The terminal ileum had a thickened wall with marked inflammatory changes in the vicinity. There were also multiple reactive lymphadenopathies in the right iliac fossa. There was an amina of free fluid in the right paracolic gutter. The cecal appendix showed minimal enlargement of its base, probably secondary to the described inflammatory changes and the proximity to the ileum. Distally the appendix was of normal calibre. Therefore, these findings were more suggestive of ileitis with associated inflammatory changes (slightly affecting the base of the appendix) than appendicitis. During admission to the gastrointestinal department and later cardiology: a study of hepatotropic viruses and HIV, anti-transglutaminase and thiopurine methyltransferase antibodies was carried out, which were negative. A determination of orosomucoid acid alpha-1-glycoprotein was requested, which was 198 mg/dl (50-120) and ferritin 940 ng/ml (21-274). A stool culture showed dysbacteriosis due to gram-positive microorganisms. Seventy-two hours after admission, chest pain analysis was requested, with elevated troponin I (high sensitivity) of 522.8 ng/l (5-34) and C-reactive protein 352 mg/l. Subsequent enzyme serum serology showed a troponin I peak of 13,418 ng/l, which subsequently decreased progressively, as well as CK 671 U/l (30-200) and NTproBNP 3405 pg/ml. An electrocardiogram was performed with chest pain, showing sinus tachycardia at 103 bpm. PR 120 ms constant. QRS 90ms, normal electrical axis. No repolarisation alterations. The electrocardiogram on the ninth day of admission showed sinus rhythm at 64 bpm. PR 160 ms constant. QRS 88 ms, normal electrical axis. QTc 429 ms. Negative T wave in III and flattened in aVF. Electrocardiogram prior to discharge showed sinus rhythm at 85 bpm. PR 140 ms constant. QRS 84 ms, normal electrical axis. Biphasic T waves on the inferolateral side. An urgent echocardiogram was performed on suspicion of myocarditis, showing: left atrium (LA) not dilated (21 ml/m2). Left ventricle (LV) not dilated (DTD 49 mm/62 ml/m2) not hypertrophic (septum 7 mm pp 7 mm mass 55 g/m2 RWT 0.29). Global hypokinesia with moderate LV systolic dysfunction (biplane Simpson EF 42%). Normofunctioning mitral valve. Filling pattern with fusion of E and A. Normofunctioning trivalve aortic valve. Aortic root and ascending aorta not dilated. Right chambers of normal size, right ventricular (RV) systolic function at low limit of normality (TAPSE 16 mm S-wave DTI 10 cm/s). Mild tricuspid insufficiency (TI) with V max 2 m/s, estimated normal PAPS. Normal pulmonary acceleration time. Dilated inferior vena cava (IVC) without adequate inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. The control echocardiogram performed 5 days later showed improvement of the previously described global hypokinesia.  CLINICAL EVOLUTION A new PCR was performed 48 hours after admission, which was negative, and COVID isolation was lifted. Subsequently, serology was performed with positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2. Seventy-two hours after admission, she began to experience repeated episodes of central thoracic pain described as stabbing, radiating to the neck, which increased with deep inspiration. They were accompanied by sweating and, on occasion, vomiting. Following the findings described in the complementary tests (analysis with elevated acute phase reactants and markers of myocardial damage, electrocardiogram with sinus tachycardia and echocardiogram with global hypokinesia), treatment was started with beta-blockers and he was transferred to the coronary unit where he was monitored without arrhythmic events of interest. After 48 hours he was transferred to the cardiology hospital ward to complete the study and treatment. During his stay on the ward he remained asymptomatic, with no evidence of heart failure. Treatment was started with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and beta-blockers. A repeat echocardiogram showed normalisation of systolic function, although slight hypokinesia persisted in the basal segments of the septum and anterolateral face. The control electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm alternating with bouts of nodal rhythm without relevant clinical translation (he did not present syncope or other alarm symptoms), so the beta-blockers were discontinued and he was monitored with telemetry and these episodes were observed during sleep, which could be secondary to vagal hypotonia or be in the context of the evolution of myocarditis. From the digestive point of view, he presented significant clinical improvement, without pain and with normalisation of intestinal transit. He completed empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole, started on admission. At discharge he had good oral tolerance. After progressive tests showed a clear decrease in myocardial enzymes, practically normalised, and in acute phase reactants, in a stable clinical and haemodynamic situation, he was discharged from hospital after 10 days of hospitalisation.  DIAGNOSIS Myocarditis and acute ileocolitis in the context of late-stage SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild hypokinesia in the basal septum and basal anterolateral septum of the LV. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Parvovirus B19 serology: Ac IgG and Ac IgM parvovirus B19 negative.  EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to gynaecology with a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in a pregnant woman. Urine and blood cultures were requested and intravenous treatment was started with gentamicin 80 mg every 8 hours, clindamycin 900 mg every 8 hours, serotherapy (1500 cc per day) and analgesia. On 23/06 the patient presented nausea, vomiting with dizziness and hypotension (BP 97/73 mmHg) and 500 cc of extra serum therapy and metoclopramide were administered. The following morning the patient persisted with general malaise and dyspnoea despite 100% saturation, which was attributed to an anxiety crisis. However, in the following hours the patient presented poor general condition with mucocutaneous pallor, sweating and peripheral coldness as well as tachycardia and tachypnoea. Examination revealed: HR 120 bpm, RR 40 rpm, BP 80/30mmg, O2 Sat 88% Pulmonary auscultation: marked bibasal hypoventilation in the right lung base. Urgent chest X-ray was performed, showing bilateral pleural effusion; urgent abdominal ultrasound, showing free intra-abdominal fluid and bilateral pleural effusion. Laboratory tests showed Na+ 128, K+ 6.3, NT-proBNP 9162, Hb 9.2, D-dimer 8421, CRP 37.42, procalcitonin 4.50, GOT 1190, GPT 377, TSH 7,690, T4 0.96, pH 7.20, pCO2 19, HCO3 12, lactate 4 and glucose 40. Given the haemodynamic deterioration of the patient with respiratory claudication, she was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of metabolic acidosis secondary to sepsis of urinary origin due to E. coli. The patient was admitted to the ICU on the afternoon of 24/06, very unstable with sustained hypotension and signs of tissue hypoperfusion requiring initial respiratory support with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and administration of 3 doses of hydrocortisone due to acute pulmonary oedema. An ECG was performed showing negative T waves on the inferior and precordial sides, as well as elevated markers of cardiac damage with peak CKMB 21.6 and troponin T 279 and NT-proBNP 12626. An urgent echocardiogram was performed showing severe systolic dysfunction with global hypokinesia, dilatation of the chambers with LVEF 10% and a cardiac output of 2 litres/minute was calculated. Given that the patient was in cardiogenic shock, treatment with vasoactive drugs with dobutamine and noradrenaline was started, which allowed systolic blood pressure to be maintained at 80 mmHg and cardiac output to improve to 5 litres/minute and LVEF 35%. With suspicion of myocarditis/ischemic cardiomyopathy, cardiac catheterisation with ventriculography and endomyocardial biopsy, cardiac MRI, parvovirus B19 serology and cardiac immunology were all negative, so the patient was attributed to possible peripartum cardiomyopathy complicated by sepsis of urinary origin. Treatment was started with bromocriptine, continued with gentamicin and associated trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The patient improved clinically, with resolution of the bilateral pleural effusion, improvement in the infectious parameters and cardiac output, allowing the progressive withdrawal of vasoactive drugs and on 01/07 she was transferred to the Cardiology ward.  Initially on the ward the evolution was favourable, allowing beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to be started at low doses. The control echocardiography showed improvement in systolic dysfunction with LVEF 35%. However, on the night of 03/07 the patient presented nausea and dizziness with hypotension of 70/40mmHg. A blood test was performed with the following alterations: creatinine 1.65, urea 58, Na+ 117, K+ 6.4, which were confirmed. Bromocriptine and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were suspended (antibiotic cycle had been completed) in case the alterations were secondary to drugs, and corrective measures for hyperkalaemia and serum therapy were administered. Given that the patient at 24-48 hours persisted with symptoms of dizziness, nausea and hypotension and with peak analytical alterations on 06/07 with creatinine 1.99, urea 90, Na+ 115, K+ 7.4, ACTH and basal cortisol were requested and IV hydrocortisone was administered on suspicion of acute adrenal insufficiency. The patient progressively improved with treatment. Endocrinology was consulted and the patient was classified as having acute adrenal insufficiency in a patient with intense stress due to urinary sepsis and cardiogenic shock due to peripartum cardiomyopathy. The patient received steroid treatment in the ICU, so the condition had remained masked. Given the haemodynamic stability of the patient and the resolution of the ionic alterations, she was discharged from hospital on 08/07/2014.  Treatment at discharge: omeprazole 20 mg 1c/24h, ramipril 2.5 mg 1c/24h, bisoprolol 2.5 mg 1c/24h, furosemide 40 mg 1/2 c/24h, levothyroxine 75 mcg 1c/24h, hydrocortisone 20 mg 1c/8h.  Evolution at discharge: at 4 months follow-up echocardiography was performed, showing improvement with LVEF 52%. At the endocrinological level, the analytical results confirmed the condition as acute adrenal insufficiency of autoimmune origin. After 9 months, the patient was asymptomatic and was living an active and independent life.

History 69-year-old woman No known drug allergies High blood pressure (HBP) Hypercholesterolemia Bronchial asthma and pneumonia in 2009 Chronic atrophic gastritis and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) liver disease Chondrocalcinosis Calcifying tendinitis of the right shoulder Osteoporosis Hyperparathyroidism with parathyroidectomy in 2001 Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss Dry eye syndrome  Cardiological history In 1978 he underwent mitral and aortic valve replacement with biological prostheses. In 1990, both prostheses malfunctioned, so a new replacement with two mechanical prostheses was performed. The aortic prosthesis was implanted at the level of the coronary ostium, so it was necessary to perform two aortocoronary grafts (saphenous vein to the anterior interventricular and right coronary artery). In 2002 he was admitted for heart failure and haemolytic anaemia related to late periprosthetic dehiscence, so a new mitral valve replacement was performed with another mechanical prosthesis and new aortocoronary grafts (saphenous vein to the middle anterior descending artery and to the right coronary artery). In 2003, DDD pacemaker implantation was performed due to symptomatic sinus node disease with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Cardiologically asymptomatic until 2014, when she was admitted several times for heart failure, the last one in August 2014.  Current illness Patient admitted for a new episode of heart failure in December 2014. A control transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, followed by a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which confirmed the presence of two mitral periprosthetic leaks (one septal and one posterior). Taking into account the patient's morbidity and the high surgical risk, the patient was scheduled for percutaneous leak closure. This procedure was performed on 08/01/2015 under general anaesthesia and with transesophageal echocardiography control in the haemodynamics room. Initial access was via the right femoral vein and, after transseptal puncture, an attempt was made to cross the posterior mitral leak (as it was the largest) in an antegrade manner, without success. Therefore, it was decided to puncture the left femoral artery and cross the mechanical aortic prosthesis with a guide and a catheter with good haemodynamic tolerance. The posterior leak is crossed and the guidewire is captured in the left atrium (LA) with a loop, externalising via the right femoral vein, thus creating an arteriovenous (AV) shunt. The size of the defect by 3D TEE is 10x4 mm, so a 10x5mm Vascular Plug device is chosen for closure. A release sheath is advanced from the right femoral vein through the defect into the left ventricle (LV) and the device is released from the LV to the LA with good placement and effective closure of the defect (video 3 and figure 1). The procedure is completed and the left femoral artery puncture is closed with good results. The patient was extubated in the ward and transferred to the coronary unit for evolutionary control in good clinical condition.  Physical examination BP: 110/48 mmHg. HR: 107 bpm. Sat.02: 100% (Reservoir at 100%). Afebrile. Conscious and oriented, good skin and mucous membrane colouring, good peripheral perfusion, eupneic at rest. Head and neck: no jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, no signs of peritoneal irritation, no masses or megaliths. Sounds present. Lower extremities: no oedema. Pedial pulses present and symmetrical. No haematoma in puncture sites. Sensibility and mobility preserved.  COMPLEMENTARY TESTS Preoperative TTE: LV neither dilated nor hypertrophic, with good global systolic function, apical aneurysm. The mechanical mitral prosthesis has a slight systolic Doppler signal. Aortic root not dilated. Mechanical aortic prosthesis with mild regurgitation and maximum gradient of 40 mmHg. Moderately dilated LA. Dilated right chambers. Right ventricle (RV) with moderate dysfunction. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with RV-RA gradient of 65 mmHg. Estimated PsAP of 80 mmHg. RV pacing lead. No pericardial effusion. Preoperative TEE: mitral prosthesis with two periprosthetic leaks, one septal and one posterior, both moderate.  EVOLUTION In subsequent outpatient controls, the patient reported feeling better, with improvement in her functional capacity. She has lost weight. In the subsequent control TTE she presented mild periprosthetic mitral insufficiency.  DIAGNOSIS Leaks or periprosthetic mitral dehiscence. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 48-year-old man came to the emergency department of a regional hospital referred from his local health centre due to progressive dyspnoea, asthenia, orthopnoea and cough in the last 24 hours.  History, current illness and physical examination History: No known drug allergies. No DM, no hypertension, no dyslipidaemia. Sporadic smoker (1 pack/day at weekends) and regular drinker (3-4 beers daily, with other drinks at weekends). Severe mitral stenosis of probable rheumatic origin (no reports), mitral valve replacement in April 2011 with Carbomedics No 27 metal prosthesis using a minimally invasive technique (Heart Port). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at discharge: Normally functioning mitral prosthesis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild atrial dilatation. Normal ejection fraction (EF). Permanent atrial fibrillation secondary to his valvular pathology. Previous surgical interventions: 'Cervical' (no reports). Usual treatment: Sintrom 4 mg, pitavastatin 2 mg, bisoprolol 2.5 mg every 12 hours, digoxin 0.25 mg every 24 hours without rest, lansoprazole 15 mg, lorazepam 1 mg occasionally. The patient had no chest pain or other symptoms apart from those mentioned above. In the following hours, during his stay in the Emergency Department of the regional hospital, the patient suffered a progressive deterioration of his general condition, with increasing dyspnoea until he became resting, pink expectoration, pallor and diaphoresis. He was transferred to the observation ward with acute pulmonary oedema (APE) requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), presenting haemodynamic instability, and entering AF with RVR around 140-150 bpm. The patient continued with poor respiratory mechanics despite NIMV, with refractory hypotension and oligoanuria, so orotracheal intubation (OTI) was performed, connection to mechanical ventilation (MV) and noradrenaline and furosemide were started in p.c. Given the rapidly unfavourable evolution of the patient, an urgent TTE was carried out at the regional hospital, and the report from the aforementioned centre showed that the mitral prosthesis had not opened. The suspicion of prosthetic thrombosis was reinforced by the finding of an INR of 1.12 in the ED analysis. It was decided to perform fibrinolysis with 10 mg of rTPA as a bolus and then 90 mg of rTPA in pc for 90 min, simultaneously initiating anticoagulation with a bolus of 4,000 IU of sodium heparin and p.c. of the same at 800 IU/h. The patient was transferred by ambulance to the ICU of our centre for urgent assessment. On admission to the ICU of our centre, the patient was sedoanalgesiated (midazolam at 0.2 mg/kg/h, morphine chloride at 1 mg/h), under OTI and connected to MV with 100% FiO2 according to standard parameters, maintaining 100% SatO2. Haemodynamically he maintained BP around 130/60 mmHg with amine support (noradrenaline at 0.3 μg/Kg/ min), in AF rhythm with RV around 90-100 bpm. Preserved diuresis with support of furosemide in p.c. at 40 mg/h, which was subsequently lowered to 20 mg/h. Diuresis on admission 300 cc. Anticoagulated with sodium heparin at 10 mg/h (10,000 IU/h). Physical examination on admission: BP 110/60 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, O2 sat 98% baseline. Conscious, oriented, reactive, perceptive. No palpable lymphadenopathies. Cardiac auscultation: Rhythmic heart tones at 85 bpm, pansystolic murmur of intensity III/VI at mitral focus level, radiating to the axilla. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, no masses or megaliths palpable. Lower extremities: No oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. Auscultation showed arrhythmic tones at about 100 bpm, no murmurs or extratonos, with audible prosthetic click in the mitral focus. Vesicular murmur was preserved bilaterally, with crackles in both lung bases. Abdomen without findings. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of DVT. The patient was assessed by on-call Cardiology, and a new TTE was performed followed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) which confirmed the diagnostic suspicion, showing thrombotic release to the left chambers and the existence of a severely depressed LVEF (see images and description in the complementary tests). Urgent catheterisation was subsequently performed, as described in the evolution.   Additional tests - ECG: AF with RV at about 120 bpm. Normal electrical axis. BIRDHH. ST depression of 1.5 mm in inferolateral face (II, III, aVF, V4-V6). - Blood gases: pH 7.25, pCO2 56, HCO3- 24, EB -2.1, Hb 18.4, SvO2 70%, ions normal, lactic 2.1. - CBC on admission to ICU: Creatinine 1.50 (previous normal), urea 37, ions normal, glucose 135, total bilirubin 1.49, direct bilirubin 0.83, CRP 39, 19,060 leukocytes, 85.9% PMN, Hb 16.9, platelets 192,000, INR 2.08, TPTA: No clotting. - Urgent TEE: Non-dilated LV with severely depressed EF with global hypokinesia. Normofunctioning trivalve aortic valve. Autocontrast in LA with images of scattered thrombi, in atrial appendage, interatrial septum and anterior portion of the mitral annulus. Mitral prosthesis with fixed anterior disc and posterior disc with preserved mobility. Peak transprosthetic gradient of 7 mmHg (AF at 100 bpm). Mild regurgitation. The ventricular side of the anterior disc shows images compatible with the presence of thrombus adhered to it. From the bicave plane, autocontrast and mobile thrombus can be seen at the mouth of the inferior cava (which is not seen again later in the study). RV not dilated with systolic function at the lower limit of normality. Conclusions: Mitral prosthetic thrombosis that does not cause significant stenosis. Multiple thrombi in LA. Severe LV dysfunction (coronary embolism?).  Clinical course In view of the TEE findings, on-call Cardiac Surgery was notified and it was decided to perform coronary angiography (due to the contractility alterations and ECG changes) and then urgent surgery, both procedures being carried out in the following hours. Catheterisation showed no angiographically significant coronary lesions, and once again the non-mobility of one of the prosthetic discs was confirmed. During the surgical procedure, a large amount of LA thrombus and thrombus causing occlusion of the aforementioned disc was observed. Remnants of the posterior mitral leaflet that may have contributed to the occlusion were observed. It was decided to remove the prosthesis and implant a new one. During CPB, with the heart at low preload, marked LV hypocontractility was observed, mainly at the expense of the middle and apical regions (septum and basal region with good mobility). He was connected to an epicardial pacemaker for sinus bradycardia. Times: ECC 138 min. Anoxia 78 min. Temperature 32 oC. He left the operating theatre with significant inotropic support (dobutamine at 10 μg/kg/min + noradrenaline at 0.3 μg/kg/min + adrenaline at 0.3 μg/kg/min + levosimendan at 0.05 μg/kg/min), maintaining AMT around 80-85 mmHg. He also presented a significant coagulation alteration, which was controlled with transfusion of blood products (800 cc plasma + 1 pool of platelets + 4 g of fibrinogen + 2 red blood cell concentrates). In the immediate postoperative period he presented abundant bleeding through the drains and anaemisation, which again required transfusion of blood products. The patient is currently still in the ICU, under sodium heparin p.c. and with good prosthetic function. In the last few hours he has been extubated and has no neurological deficits on examination, and is progressing favourably.  Diagnosis - Mitral prosthetic thrombosis in a poorly anticoagulated patient. Urgent fibrinolysis partially effective with thrombotic release to the left chambers. - Severe LV dysfunction with alterations in contractility and ECG changes in this context, with no evidence of coronary embolism. - Impaired renal function secondary to low output, now resolved. |O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O B-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FARMACO I-FARMACO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
