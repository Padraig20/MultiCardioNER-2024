At	O
first	O
it	O
was	O
thought	O
that	O
the	O

entered	O
the	O

pushed	O
the	O

,	O
creating	O
a	O

it	O
,	O
like	O
a	O

.	O
During	O
the	O
operation	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
found	O
that	O
the	O

appeared	O
to	O
be	O
intact	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
tissue	O
inside	O
the	O
capsule	O
that	O
could	O
alter	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O

were	O
no	O

in	O
the	O

that	O
was	O
in	O
contact	O
with	O
the	O
site	O
of	O
fat	O
infiltration	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
nevertheless	O
decided	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
biopsy	O
of	O
the	O
area	O
of	O
injected	O

this	O

with	O

of	O
malignancy	O
.	O
When	O
we	O
removed	O
the	O
prosthesis	O
for	O
examination	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
struck	O
by	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
opaque	O
spots	O
scattered	O
in	O
different	O
places	O
inside	O
it	O
,	O
with	O
no	O
linear	O
distribution	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
lead	O
us	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
these	O
were	O

However	O
,	O
at	O
a	O

close	O

of	O
these	O
,	O
after	O
applying	O

we	O
saw	O
that	O
the	O
